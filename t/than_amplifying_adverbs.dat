Moreover, the estimates suggest that endogenous depreciation serves to mitigate rather <b>than</b> <b>amplify</b> the effect of the energy price shock...|$|R

Also, five-string and six-string models (not generally available in acoustic cellos) allow for an extended range.

40|$|The {{care and}} {{protection}} of children experiencing orphanhood presents a major child-care policy challenge. This paper draws on {{a review of the}} literature to document divergent conceptualizations of orphanhood, how the hurdles for the care of orphans reflect wider issues of poverty and inequality, as well as the ways in which different care interventions (familial, institutional, community-based and rights-based) might be appropriated for children in need. It is argued that the map of contemporary orphanhood overlaps with the contours of global poverty, inequality, age-based deprivations and marginalization. An example of a ‘globalised’ model of orphan care, namely SOS Children’s Villages, is presented and its implications for policy are examined. The paper highlights the significance of fighting poverty and enhancing the care-giving capabilities of extended families in the care {{and protection of}} children from a rights-based perspective. It suggests that external interventions should primarily address the structural causes of poverty and marginality, rather <b>than</b> <b>amplifying</b> inequalities through the selective support of orphans in economically vulnerable communities...|$|R

40|$|It has {{regularly}} been {{pointed out}} in the literature that EFL learners tend to be largely unaware of register variation, and in particular that they use spoken-like features in their written production (see, e. g., Altenberg & Tapper 1998, Granger & Rayson 1998, Gilquin & Paquot 2008). This has appeared from comparisons between corpora of written learner English and corpora of spoken and written native English, which show that the written learner corpora often display features more typical of native speech than of native writing (for example first and second person pronouns or <b>amplifying</b> <b>adverbs).</b> Thanks to the recent availability of learner corpora of speech, it has now become possible to bring spoken interlanguage into the equation, and thus consider problems of register confusion in both writing and speech. In this presentation, I will investigate the use of phrasal verbs, a particularly difficult area of language for learners of English, in two learner corpora, namely the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE; Granger et al. 2009), representing written interlanguage, and the Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI; Gilquin et al. 2010). Both corpora include data produced by learners from different mother tongue backgrounds, which makes it possible to investigate the influence of medium among several learner populations. Phrasal verbs being generally recognized as sensitive to register variation (they are said to occur more frequently in speech than in writing, cf. Cornell 1985 : 269), they constitute an interesting starting point to examine learners’ stylistic preferences. Here, the focus will be on phrasal verbs with the particles 'up' and 'down'. Relying on comparisons with similar data for native English (from the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays and the Louvain Corpus of Native English Conversation), the corpus study reveals that learners have a tendency to underuse phrasal verbs with 'up' and 'down', but use them more frequently in writing (ICLE) than in speech (LINDSEI), which is to be contrasted with the situation for native English. The quantitative analysis will be supplemented by a qualitative analysis, which will investigate the types of phrasal verbs that are used by learners in speech and writing, and which will seek to determine whether register confusion is at play in the choice of phrasal verbs too. More generally, the study will try to explain learners’ distinctive “stylistic signatures” (Gilquin et al. 2007 : 322) by referring to the context in which English as a foreign language is usually learned...|$|R
40|$|Organism-wide RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{is due to}} {{the transport}} of mobile silencing RNA throughout the organism but the identities of these mobile RNA species in animals are unknown. Here we present genetic evidence that both the initial double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which triggers RNAi, and at least one dsRNA intermediate produced during RNAi can act as or generate mobile silencing RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans. This dsRNA intermediate requires the long dsRNA-binding protein RDE- 4, the endonuclease DCR- 1, which cleaves long dsRNA into double-stranded short-interfering RNA (ds-siRNA), and the putative nucleotidyltransferase MUT- 2 (RDE- 3). However, single-stranded siRNA and downstream secondary siRNA produced upon amplification by the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase RRF- 1 do not generate mobile silencing RNA. Restricting inter-tissue transport to long dsRNA and directly processed siRNA intermediates rather <b>than</b> <b>amplified</b> siRNA may serve to modulate the extent of systemic silencing in proportion to available dsRNA.

As digital recording and playback technology has become increasingly more affordable and widespread over recent years, black markets have grown up worldwide, based on cheap ‘‘illegal’’ reproduction of commercial media, today sold by informal entrepreneurs in rural markets, shops and street corners around Ecuador. Piggybacking on this pirate infrastructure, Quichua-speaking media producers and consumers have begun to circulate indigenous-language video at an unprecedented rate, helped by small-scale merchants who themselves profit by supplying market demands for positive images of indigenous people.

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis may primarily be a banking crisis, and the solvency {{of the insurance}} sector as a whole {{does not appear to}} be threatened. Nonetheless, insurance companies have been affected, and in mostly adverse ways. For many insurers, direct exposure to the epicentre of the crisis, the US mortgage market, and to related securities appears to have been limited. But the {{financial crisis}} has nonetheless had an increasingly visible impact on the insurance industry, primarily through their investment portfolios, as the crisis spread and financial market valuations and the outlook for real activity deteriorated significantly. Also, a number of concentrated exposures to credit and market risks have been revealed, including in US mortgage and financial guarantee insurance companies, as well as in parts of certain other insurance-dominated financial groups. Thus, while insurers as a group may have cushioned rather <b>than</b> <b>amplified</b> the downward pressures during the financial crisis, some clearly have added to downward pressures. Financial instruments that were at the core of difficulties served an insurance function and, thus, it is not so surprising that some institutions from that sector have been affected by the crisis on one or the other side of their balance sheets. ...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{empirical}} literature on international politics a perplexing-ly perennial research topic {{has been the}} relationship between alliances and war. Although much of the traditional literature of {{the balance of power}} argues that alliances are undertaken to offset aggressive powers and hence lead to peace through deterrence, most of the recent literature is derived from ideas which suggest that alliances are destabilizing and lead to war. To a significant extent the linkage between alliances and war rests upon ideas expressed in Deutsch and Singer’s “Multipolar Power Systems and International Stability ” (1964). In this now classic paper they postulate a partial theory of international conflict based upon ideas from pluralist thought; specifically, they argue that flexibility in the internationql system will be accompanied by low levels of conflict and war. This is because an international system in which nations have foreign policy flexibility, or freedom to interact, produces cross-cutting cleavages, which muffle rather <b>than</b> <b>amplify</b> conflict. In their view, alliances tend to reduce freedom of interaction for nations, which, in turn, leads to rigidities that amplify conflict.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{minimizing the}} achievable distortion of a Gaussian source over a two-hop block fading channel under mean square-error criterion. It {{is assumed that}} there is not a direct link between transmission ends and the communication is carried out through the use of a relay, employing the Decode and Forward (DF) strategy. Moreover, for both of transmitter-to-relay and relay-to-destination links the channel statistics are merely available at the corresponding receivers, while the channel gains are not available at the affiliated transmitters. It is assumed that a Gaussian source is hierarchically encoded through the use of successive refinement source coding approach and sent to the relay using a multi-layer channel code. Similarly, the relay transmits the retrieved information to the destination through the use of a multi-layer code. Accordingly, in a Rayleigh block fading environment, the optimal power allocation across code layers is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the achievable distortion of the proposed multi-layer approach outperforms that of single-layer code. Moreover, the resulting distortion of DF strategy is better <b>than</b> <b>Amplify</b> and Forward~(AF) strategy for channel mismatch factors greater than one, while the resulting distortion has a marginal degradation for channel mismatch factors lower than one.

40|$|The {{objective}} of global regulatory reform {{is to build}} a resilient global financial system that can withstand shocks and dampen, rather <b>than</b> <b>amplify,</b> their effects on the real economy.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the interplay}} between the surface confined wave modes and the linear and nonlinear gain of the dielectric layer in the Otto configuration. The surface confined wave modes such as surface plasmons or waveguide modes are excited in the dielectric-metal bilayer by obliquely incident $p$ waves. In the purely linear case, we find that {{the interplay between}} linear gain and surface confined wave modes can generate a large reflectance peak with its value much greater than 1. As the linear gain parameter increases, the peak appears at smaller incident angles, and the associated modes also change from surface plasmons to waveguide modes. When the nonlinear gain is turned on, the reflectance shows very strong multistability near the incident angles associated with surface confined wave modes. As the nonlinear gain parameter is varied, the reflectance curve undergoes complicated topological changes and sometimes displays separated closed curves. When the nonlinear gain parameter takes an optimally small value, a giant amplification of the reflectance by three orders of magnitude occurs near the incident angle associated with a waveguide mode. We also find that there exists a range of the incident angle where the wave is dissipated rather <b>than</b> <b>amplified</b> even in the presence of gain. We suggest that this can provide the basis for a possible new technology for thermal control in the subwavelength scale. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the causes}} of rear end crashes is {{tailgating}} (following too closely). (In this report, tailgating does not refer only to deliberately aggressive close following, the driver may consider the close distance to be appropriate.) Calculations about how tailgating can lead to rear end crashes are presented. A distinction is made between conditions in which improved braking performance will and those in which it will not {{reduce the likelihood of}} a rear end crash. Short gaps between one vehicle and the next are very common in ordinary driving. Because of the possibility of a disturbance in flow being amplified as it passes from one vehicle to another, drivers bear a collective responsibility to vehicles behind them to try to dampen rather <b>than</b> <b>amplify</b> disturbances. Evidence from rear end crashes that were investigated in depth by staff at CASR (Centre for Automotive Safety Research, University of Adelaide) is that inattention in various forms is a more frequent cause than tailgating. (It is noted that methods of classification of rear end crashes are surprisingly coarse and not very helpful for devising remedial measures.) Potential measures to counter tailgating are discussed: advisory signs, markings on the road surface, enforcement by the police, a futuristic proposal for enforcement by the public, and improvements to the vehicle. There is reason to think that each of these would meet with some success. T. P. Hutchinso...|$|R

60|$|The prime minister’s {{manifesto}} to {{his constituents}} at Greenwich was elaborate and sustained. In substance it did no more <b>than</b> <b>amplify</b> the various considerations {{that he had}} set forth {{in his letter to}} Lord Granville. The pith of it was a promise to diminish local taxation, and to repeal the income-tax. At the same time marked relief was to be given to the general consumer in respect of articles of popular consumption. One effective passage dealt with the charge that the liberal party had endangered the institutions of the country. “It is time,” said Mr. Gladstone, “to test this trite and vague allegation. There has elapsed a period of forty, or more exactly forty-three years, since the liberal party acquired the main direction of public affairs. This followed another period of about forty years beginning with the outbreak of the revolutionary war, during which there had been an almost unbroken rule of their opponents, who claimed and were reputed to be the great preservers of the institutions of the country.” He then invited men to judge by general results, and declared that the forty years of tory rule closing in 1830 left institutions weaker than it had found them, whereas the liberal term of forty years left throne, laws, and institutions not weaker but much stronger. The address was a fine bold composition, but perhaps it would have been more effective with a public that was impatient and out of humour, if it had been shorter.|$|R
40|$|Two {{divergent}} perspectives {{have been}} {{articulated in the}} literature regarding the effect that an unbalanced sex ratio is speculated to have on male-on-female intimate partner violence. Evolutionary psychology proffers that a high sex ratio (i. e., {{more men than women}} in the population) propagates competition among males for female mates. This competition for female mates is thought to engender sexual jealousy among men, which in turn results in male-on-female intimate partner violence. In contrast, the Guttentag and Secord thesis argues that a high sex ratio acts to attenuate rather <b>than</b> <b>amplify</b> male-on-female intimate partner violence because the relatively small number of women in the population makes them more highly valued and respected by men. Using data culled from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Census, we investigate the relationship between the sex ratio and male-on-female intimate partner violence. We define male-on-female intimate partner violence as violence occurring within a marriage or boyfriend/girlfriend type relationship. Multivariate regression results furnish evidence supporting evolutionary psychology by demonstrating that a high sex ratio increases male-on-female intimate partner violence. Results also show that male-on-female intimate partner violence is higher in cities where more women work. Such a finding further buttresses the logic associated with evolutionary psychology because participation in the workforce is theorized to afford a woman a greater opportunity to meet and interact with men other than her husband or boyfriend. ...|$|R
