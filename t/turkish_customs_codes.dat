40|$|In {{the present}} article author {{analyzes}} the institutional framework of the Customs Union of the EU and the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> of the EU. Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic Community. The EU Customs Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation of the customs union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field of customs cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> occupies rules aimed at regulating the customs debt and guarantees. The provisions of the new <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> (Section 3 of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union. In conclusion, author notes that all matters relating to customs policy of the European Union are regulated in the founding treaties and the rules of the <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> only detail the provisions of the EU founding treaties. Author also concludes that the application of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> of the European Union outside the context of the founding treaties of the European Union is impossible...|$|R

40|$|NASA's mission {{critical}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{command and control}} system has been re-engineered with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) and minimal <b>custom</b> <b>code.</b> This paper focuses {{on the design of}} this new HST Control Center System (CCS) and the lessons learned throughout its development. CCS currently utilizes more than 30 COTS/GOTS products with an additional 1 / 2 million lines of custom glueware code; the new CCS exceeds the capabilities of the original system while significantly reducing the lines of <b>custom</b> <b>code</b> by more than 50 %. The lifecycle of COTS/GOTS products will be examined including the package selection process, evaluation process, and integration process.

Efficient use of COTS tools and applications by the development team will greatly reduce the need to develop <b>custom</b> <b>code.</b> Any <b>custom</b> <b>code</b> created will be checked into CM and maintained under CM control. This will ensure the integrity of the software baseline. Peer Reviews will be conducted to evaluate any <b>custom</b> <b>code</b> that is developed.
