Calculation {{methods of}} {{standard}} deviation in Up-and-Down <b>method,</b> which are <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> and modified method of GJB/Z 377 A- 1994, are analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation, and estimation accuracy of standard deviation is improved by combining <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> with modified method,which is called combinative method. It shows that estimation accuracy of <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> is more precise than modified method with any sample size. Estimation accuracy of combinative method {{is better than}} other two methods when sample size is between 26 and 39, while has the same estimation accuracy as <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> in the other sample size,and the optimumvalue of a is given...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{two methods}} are {{proposed}} {{to give the}} interval estimation for two parameters Log- Normal distribution. We usually use <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> to construct interval estimation. This interval needs a t distribution and chi-square distribution and namely <b>traditional</b> <b>method.</b> We will use another method, namely bootstrap percentile. Bootstrap percentile method more potential in constructing two parameters interval and give shorter interval than <b>traditional</b> <b>method.</b> This method does not need an assumption that the sample has to have t and chi-square distributions...|$|R
50|$|Today {{there are}} two main methods of smoking fish: The <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> and the {{mechanical}} <b>method.</b> The <b>traditional</b> <b>method</b> involves the fish being suspended in smokehouses over slowly smouldering wood shavings.

5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Essex {{has one of}} {{the longest}} coastlines of any English county, with saltmarshes, lagoons, mudflats, grazing marshes, reedbeds and shingle. Its ancient forests were {{formerly}} important to the local economy, with wood being used for fuel, construction and bark in the tanning industry. Coppicing is being re-introduced by the EWT to encourage woodland grasses, flowers, invertebrates and birds. A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to <b>traditional</b> <b>methods,</b> supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some brownfield sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by <b>traditional</b> <b>methods,</b> which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The Echo {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought {{an end to}} the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E

5|$|As the Biddulphs were {{interested}} in the Arts and Crafts movement, using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 under the supervision of his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. The built took a total of 23 years, largely due to the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build.|$|E
5|$|The stellate plan found {{popularity}} in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, {{with the exception of}} the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents. The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic dravida articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of <b>traditional</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow <b>traditional</b> <b>methods.</b> After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E
5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E
