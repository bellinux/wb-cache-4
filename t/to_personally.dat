5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually <b>to</b> <b>personally</b> offer the tribute.

In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule.
