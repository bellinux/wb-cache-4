40|$|From Preface: In {{this thesis}} I have aimed at {{covering}} {{a field in}} Economic History where not many suitable publications are available in English. During the interwar period, the maintenance of peace and harmonious international relations was directly dependent on a reconciliation of the conflicting interests between France and Germany. In studying the economic implications of the Franco-German antagonism, I have tried to throw light upon the crucial role which this relationship played. The Appendix offers a quantitative survey of economic conditions {{in the two countries}} and of the relevant production and exchange problems. To assist the reader who is not completely familiar with this period, a brief summary of the relevant conferences, agreements and treaties is also offered in the Appendix, as well as some short biographical notes. I would like to make it clear, however, that this thesis is neither supposed to be a paraphrase of the Appendix, nor a mere treatise on the commercial relations between the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned.</b> I aimed rather at revealing the forces behind the events and at illustrating how economic problems became quite often subject to political and military considerations. When trying to attain some understanding of Franco-German relations, it seems advisable to look not only at the interbellum period, but in the first instance to become aware of the currents of history which finally led to the two disastrous World Wars...|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers a}} new reading of Conservative {{approaches}} to territorial government in the UK {{in the early years}} of the Cold War. As is well known, the Conservatives enhanced the place of both Scotland and Wales in Government on their return to office in 1951. The former gained a new Minister of State (Alec Douglas-Home) to support the existing Secretary of State; the latter a Minister for Welsh Affairs (Sir David Maxwell Fyfe), and Cabinet representation for the first time. Hitherto, these concessions have been explained primarily with reference to the internal politics of the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned,</b> and particularly the pressures of local nationalism. In this article, the policies are examined from a central perspective, and the rhetorical context of the Scottish and Welsh policies compared with that surrounding the Conservatives’ proposals to reform local government in England. Together, it is argued, they reveal the importance of decentralisation to Conservative attempts to combat Labour between 1947 and 1951. The Conservatives championed a State in which the reach of the State carefully delimited and local patriotism celebrated as a cornerstone of a distinctively ‘British way of life’. Labour, by contrast, was presented as wishing to subsume these historical differences within a uniform Socialist State controlled from London – or Moscow. In the atmosphere of growing alarm that characterised the early years of the Cold War, the Conservatives used a discourse of decentralisation to represent the cultural and economic absolutism of a Socialism’ as both unhistorical and un-British...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} saving {{is one of}} the main factors to {{economic}} growth is unquestionable. Accumulated saving can be consider as the sources of capital stock to which play a crucial role in creating investment, production, and employment. And all these activities eventually enhance the economic growth. Therefore the main objective of this paper, ―The relationship between domestic saving and economic growth and convergence hypothesis: case study of Thailand‖, was to investigate the causality relationship between the domestic saving and economic growth of Thailand. This paper will analyze whether the direction of causality go from domestic saving to economic growth, or vice versa. Granger causality test were conducted by using time series annual data from 1960 to 2010, and the empirical result suggests that the direct of causality go from economic growth to domestic saving only. Aiming to grow its economy, Thailand had had development plans which used both saving and direct investment to stimulate economy. This paper examine whether the convergence hypothesis does hold in Thailand. This part would check whether or not Thailand is in the process of convergence, catching up, lagging behind, loose catching up, loose lagging behind or divergence over time compared with other developed countries. This test was conducted in pairwise between Thailand-Singapore, Thailand-United States, Thailand-United Kingdom, deployed data from 1970 to 2010, and the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) Test. The regression results demonstrate that convergence hypothesis does not hold in Thailand. Finally, the result of Granger Causality report that economic growth rate does matter lead to growth rate of domestic savings in Thailand only. Thus, in order to learn the effect of gross domestic saving per capita growth rate can help narrow the different of GDP between <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned,</b> this paper will examine the correlation of two variables, deployed the OSL methods to investigate the correlation between gross domestic saving growth rate and the different of GDP per capita between Thailand and Singapore. This test also examine whether saving does help support convergence hypothesis for Thailand or not. The test results shows that domestic saving growth rate does not help narrowing the range of different of income of Thailand and Singapore which mean that domestic saving growth rate does not support the convergence hypothesis in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|Prominent {{among the}} many {{competing}} explana-tions that have been advanced to account for foreign exchange rate movements in the post-Bretton Woods era of floating exchange rates is the so-called pur-chasing power parity (PPP) theory. One of the most popular, simple, and durable explanations of exchange rate behavior, the purchasing power parity doctrine holds that currencies are valued for what they will buy. Therefore the relative external value of two currencies, i. e., the exchange rate between them, is determined by their relative internal purchas-ing powers {{as measured by the}} ratio of the general price levels in the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned.</b> From this it follows that changes in relative national price levels determine changes in the exchange rate. In particular, the theory predicts that the percentage rate of change of the exchange rate will tend to equal the differential between the relative rates of price inflation at home and abroad. Thus if the domestic rate of inflation in the U. S. is, say, five percentage points higher than the comparable rate of inflation in Switzerland, the theory maintains that the dollar will tend to depreciate on the foreign exchanges at a rate of five percent relative to the Swiss franc. It follows from the theory that the way to strengthen a cur-rency’s external value is to strengthen its internal value by reducing the domestic rate of inflation. In terms of the preceding example, the way to arrest the fall of the dollar relative to the Swiss franc is to bring the U. S. rate of inflation down into equality with the lower Swiss rate. With both currencies experiencing the same rate of inflation (or fall in internal purchasing power), their relative purchasing power will remain unchanged and the exchange rate will stabilize. The foregoing view is scarcely new. Rather it is the product of at least 175 years of past theorizing about the connection between money, prices, and exchange rates. It is no exaggeration to say that the PPP doctrine has attracted the attention of some of the leading monetary theorists of all time, includ...|$|E

The other aspect of the demarcation of the field of study is based on the explanation of terms used in the title of this study, namely: the national educational ideal, determinant, educational system, and Bophuthatswana and Botswana. The theoretical structure and the determinants of the educational system have also been discussed in chapter 2. The four structural moments of the educational system are looked into under the theoretical structure of the system of education. The following are those structural moments of the educational system: • the religious structural moment, which refers to the ground motif of the community which is fundamental in all the systems of education of the world. This is the religious ground motif. • the temporal structural moment, which refers to the fact that educational systems of the world are time-bound. • the modal structural moment, which refers to the 15 modal aspects of reality in terms of Dooyeweerd and which exercise an influence on the structure and the content of the educational system. • the individual structural moment, which refers to the individual identity of all educational systems of the world and to the idea of the uncommonness of the common. All other relevant aspects of education have been discussed in this chapter. An exposition of the educational system of Bophuthatswana is given in Chapter 3. The primary aim in discussing this educational system was to provide the origin, content and influence of the national educational ideal of Popagano on the Bophuthiltswana system of education. Before coming to the exposition of the educational system of Bophuthatswana per se, the following issues which facilitate the understanding of an educational system were discussed: The general historical background of education in Bophuthatswana; from the era of traditional education, the mission era of education, education in Bophuthatswana after the establishment of the Union of South Africa, the Bantu Education era, the years before independence (195 - 1 - 1976), the Lokhela Commission of Education (April 1978) and the inception of the national educational ideal of Popagano. The exposition of the Bophuthatswana system of Cidiic. it on is divided into the following aspects; the contents of the National Educational ideal of Popagano and the influence of the national educational ideal of Popagano. In Chapter 4 the system of education of Botswana is outlined. Before coming to the actual exposition of the system of education in Botswana, it was necessary to look into the following matters: the origin of the national educational ideal of Kagisano. This included the following aspects: the general historical background of education in Botswana which reflects on the years of turmoil, traditional education in the pre-literate era, the mission era of education; education in Botswana after the establishment of the British Bechuanaland Protectorate, the first Education Act after Independence, the Botswana National Education Commission of April 1977 and the inception of the national educational ideal of Kagisano; the contents of the national educational ideal of Kagisano and the influence of the national educational ideal of Kagisano on the educational system of Botswana.

We analyse the determinants of part time work and the gender occupational segregation in both countries. Part time work of women is in Sweden the consequence of maternity. In France, it seems is directly linked to the high level of unemployment. The occupational segregation is higher in Sweden : the mothers' employment is much more concentrated in female dominated occupations, often in the public sector than the French one. This could be the consequence of the parental leave. Parental leave, child care, mothers' employment, occupational segregation. ...|$|R

Fertility intention {{can be described}} on several levels: the individual level, the partner level and the country level. From an economic point of view, the wish to get more than one child is determined by opportunity costs of women and direct costs for children. Opportunity costs depend on their human capital and can be mediated through partnership and country characteristics. I assume that household income for example can only mediate the effects on opportunity costs for women in countries, where a broad childcare system is offered or paid private childcare arrangements are common. By {{using data from the}} Generations- and Gender Survey, differences between the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerning</b> household income and mothers’ educational level can be found. Income seems to be more important in Hungary, where full-time day-care is often available. In Germany, education is more important than income. It can be assumed that higher educated German women, who already decided to have a child despite their high opportunity costs are more family oriented. All in all, a rather different picture for fertility intentions can be found, where none of the three levels should be neglected...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores some of {{the issues}} {{concerning}} the concept of European identity. In particular, the aim is to assess how far school education is a suitable method to foster a European identity and support for European integration. In this context, the thesis aims to investigate whether the historic and more recent political and national developments in England and Germany have resulted in different attitudes to European integration, European identity and subsequently to a European dimension in education. The analysis also compares the general attitude towards national and European identity and European integration in England and Germany and assesses if different attitudes have resulted in a different implementation of a European dimension in education. To facilitate this analysis, the political and national development in England and Germany as well as the emergence of the European idea and the history of European integration will be discussed. The assessment of a European dimension in secondary education in England and Germany includes an analysis of documentary material and selected curricula. In addition, a survey has been carried out among a sample of German and English head and subject teachers to explore aspects of the practical implementation of a European dimension. The findings show that there are significant differences between the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerning</b> their understanding and implementation of a European dimension in education. Many of these differences can be attributed to different attitudes to national and European identity and European integration. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} the reports on power and democracy which were finished in Denmark and Norway in 2003. The paper is an attempt at explaining the reason for the great differences between the conclusions of the two reports {{when it comes to the}} democratic role of civil society in the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> While the Danish report claims that the Danish democracy is ”still viable”, the Norwegians claim that the Norwegian democracy is “disintegrating”. The differences are interesting since Denmark and Norway both have political systems which, according to the literature of the field, and compared to other democracies, are very similar. By means of comparative analyses of Denmark and Norway, the paper reveals differences between the two reports both when it comes to definitions and interpretations in addition to differences between the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerning</b> the development of civil society, the structure in the variety of organizations and individual approaches to political commitment, participation and trust. The investigations show that the difference in definitions for democracy and political participation probably has had the greatest effect on the conclusions of the two reports, since the Norwegian reports clearly have tougher criteria as to what constitutes meaningful democratic participation. The groups of variables that constitute the foundation of the analyses are definitions and interpretations used in the reports, historical development, where the focus is on the creation of civil society and the development in both countries, the structural relationships in the variety of organizations in both Denmark and Norway, and political commitment, participation and trust among the people.

The public debate analysis is mainly restricted to analysing reports from Bioteknologinemnda and from its relevant public meetings and of reports from Comité Consultatif Nationale d’Éthiques (CCNE) in France. The topics subject of analysis are: - Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) and PGD with Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) typing - Egg donation - Assisted medical reproduction for lesbian and gay couple - Surrogacy Methods I have analysed the Norwegian and French laws pertaining to biotechnology involving Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), and also the relevant reports, included discussion documents, from Bioteknologinemnda and the CCNE. Main results PGD and PGD-HLA is legal in both countries under equal conditions. Until now however, PGD-HLA are just temporarily legalized in France, but the French government now suggests to legalize PGD-HLA on a permanent basis. As {{a consequence of the}} changed marriage law in Norway, lesbian couples now have the right to access ART. In France, homosexuality is viewed as a social reason for infertility, and ART is reserved heterosexual couples for medical reasons- either infertility or infectious diseases. Egg donation is forbidden in Norway, based upon the roman juridical principle Mater Semper Certa Est. In France however, this is legalized. From their point of view, there is principally no difference between the two. Until this day, the French and the Norwegian government say no to surrogacy. This is because of the health risks for the surrogacy mother, the possible psychological risks for the child, lack of juridical protection of the couple wanting to have a child, and economical and global dilemmas...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and compare the perceptions of urban parents of <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerning</b> standards of selected criteria of high quality standards of early childhood programs developed by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs (NAECP). Two hundred and forty nine parents (U. S. = 129, Taiwan = 120) participated in the study. The effects of country, sex, and educational background were examined. The study was conducted by using the questionnaire survey. The instrument was constructed by the researcher based on the Accreditation Criteria and Procedures of the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs. A three-way. MANOVA on 10 dependent variables with independent factors of country, sex, and educational background was used to test Hypothesis I at the. 05 level of significance. The Hypothesis I was rejected. To test Hypothesis II, a Spearman's Rho rank order correlation coefficient was computed using the mean ranks of the 10 criteria. Significance was examined at the. 05 level. The Hypothesis II was accepted. These findings leading to the following conclusions: 1. American and Taiwanese parents shared the similar perceptions that supported the quality standards developed by the NAECP. Most of the statistically differences that existed between American and Taiwanese parents were the differences of the degree of acceptance of the quality standards. 2. The only criterion that caused parents' selections to lean toward negative responses was the staffing standards. 3. Whenever there was a statistically significant difference between American and Taiwanese parents, the Taiwanese parents were always agreed more than the American parents. 4. Regardless of factors of sex and educational background, both American and Taiwanese parents shared similar values in that they ranked health-and-safety and teacher-child interactions as the first or second important factors. 5. Regardless of the factors of sex and educational background, both American and Taiwanese parents shared the same values in that they ranked administration and evaluations as the two least important factors when selecting an early childhood program for their children.

40|$|National {{identity}} {{is believed to}} create a sense of trust and solidarity amongst co-nationals that is necessary to underpin the democratic welfare state. Immigration, in turn, is viewed as a potential threat to the stability of such a shared national identity. Yet concerns about immigration in public opinion are to a large extent dependent on how people understand the meaning of their national identity. Therefore, this thesis argues that different kinds of shared identities may construct images of immigration that are seen as less of a threat. The key argument this thesis pursues is that attitudes to immigration are affected by constructed understandings of identity, belonging and exclusion. To this end, a focused, qualitative, comparative study of Sweden and Britain has been conducted. 47 in-depth interviews were conducted with respondents from the <b>two</b> <b>countries,</b> <b>concerning</b> questions of identity, democracy, welfare and immigration. The main findings are threefold. First, three different understandings of a shared identity are found, for which belonging is based either on an idea of a common nation, on making contributions to the community or on a commitment to social and political institutions. Second, these identities are differently related to attitudes to immigration. Those for whom belonging is based on a common nation are the most negative to immigration. Those for whom the boundaries of belonging depend on institutions are the most positive, followed by those who base belonging on contributions. Third, national identity seems to be constructed by interpretations, as well as the institutional and political context, of the democratic welfare state. Thus, the welfare state is argued to be an important, yet overlooked, factor that influences the formation of symbolic boundaries of political communities. In short, ideas of institutions and contributions were found to have strong inclusionary potential, in contrast to when belonging is primarily based on renderings of a common nation. This thesis therefore argues that a form of “institutional patriotism”, for which belonging is based on the experience of, and commitment to, fair and effective social and political institutions, can generate trust and solidarity whilst being more welcoming to newcomers. ...|$|R
25|$|In October 1949, Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China {{took power}} in China. With this accomplished, Marxist governments now {{controlled}} {{a third of}} the world's land mass. Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the Chinese Civil War. In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty between the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Stalin was <b>concerned</b> that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance from China; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.|$|R
40|$|This paper exsamines {{which way}} Denmark and Great Britain handled the Jewish {{refugees}} in the 1930 ’s {{before and after the}} Kristallnacht. We want to find the similarities and differences between the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> policy <b>concerning</b> refugees and if there was any changes after the Kristallnacht. In addition we want to find out how the discussion in the public debate was in the papers; ”The Times”, ”Social-demokraten” and ”Berlingske Tidende”. In order to do this the project is based on historical literature from Denmark and Great Britain. We use mainly Hans Kirchhoff “Et menneske uden pas er ikke noget menneske” for the danish part of the policy and as support we use Lone Rünitz “Danmark og de jødiske flygtninge” as well. For the british aspect we use A. J. Sherman “Island Refuge” and furthermore we use John Hope Simpson “The refugee problem”. We have analyzed which factors influenced the policy of the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> and thereby justify why they chose the policy they had. The results show that the conditions and the factors which influenced the policy in the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> was the difference in a country as a great power and as a statelet country, the geographic position, the fear against Germany, and the economic aspect. The policy in Denmark was very neutral and based on a lie-low-policy. Before 1939 Great Britain led an Appeasement-policy. After 1939 they changed their policy and opened up for more refugees. Denmark kept the neutral policy throughout the 1930 ’s. There were both similarities and differences between Denmark and Great Britain because of the countries sizes, populations and the distance for action against Germany. But still the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> led a similar policy towards refugees. Furthermore the papers discussion about the Kristallnacht reflect the policy in the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> The papers in the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> were uncritical against Germany, and {{it was only in the}} danish papers that an implicit criticism was showing, because they gave the Kristallnacht a very central position in the paper. This project can relate to today’s international refugee problem and how there is similarities from the way they handled refugees back then and the way they tackle the problem know...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years the public has become in general more {{ambivalent}} towards new technologies and while expecting technological innovation to make their life better, they still old concerns about possible adverse effects deriving from the use of these technologies. The present paper offers a comparative approach on <b>two</b> European member <b>countries</b> <b>concerning</b> attitudes towards genetically modified food. The paper focus on values because previous research has shown that socio-economic factors can only partially explain differences in attitudes towards genetically modified food. Strong national differences lead to the idea that cultural differences should also be taken into account. Following the approach of Schwartz, the scope of this research paper is to analyse cultural priorities concerning genetically modified food at the individual level. Using data collected in Germany and Greece, the suitability of values to express continuous processes of cultural and individual changes is explored in relation to genetically modified food. attitudes towards genetically modified food, attitude formation, cultural differentiation, value, Consumer/Household Economics, Q 1, Z 1,...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{perspectives}} of the mental health {{needs of the people}} of Africa, this study explored and compared the models of psychiatric-mental health nursing education in <b>two</b> sub-Saharan African <b>countries</b> - Botswana and Nigeria. The primary {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the design, the implementation, the factors that influence and the perceived usefulness of psychiatric-mental health nursing education programmes in developing African countries, using Nigeria and Botswana as examples. A self-reporting questionnaire, administered to psychiatric nurse educators from the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> of <b>concern,</b> provided the primary source of data. A curriculum evaluation checklist based on Horan, Knight, McAtee and Westrick (1984) was used to assess the components of the existing psychiatric nursing education curricula from the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Discussions were also held with practising psychiatric nurses and officials of the nursing regulatory bodies from the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Data from both countries revealed that participants used various terms to describe the same model for psychiatric-mental health nursing education adopted in their countries. Botswana, however, adopted a more functional generalist basic diploma nursing education approach which encouraged a more advanced post-basic diploma specialisation and practice in community psychiatric-mental health nursing. Nigeria's model leaned towards a hospital centred basic specialisation with no defined role for the generalist nurse within the psychiatric-mental health nursing care system. Community theme occurred in both countries' curricula with varying degrees of emphasis, as all the programmes claimed the intent to make psychiatric-mental health nursing service available to individuals, families and the communities at all levels of care. Psychiatric-mental health nursing education programmes of the <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> had been influenced at different times by war, colonial history, changing standards of health care delivery, government health policies, economic status of the country, professional status of nursing and the changing standard of education. A model that streamlined psychiatric-mental health nursing education within the general system of education in both countries was proposed. It was stressed that one key concept that must underlie the development of psychiatric-mental health nursing education was the need to create a mental health nursing role that would be appropriate for people's health needs rather than the needs of the health care system.

40|$|The intergenerational {{impact of}} public {{transfers}} {{on the economic}} and social outcome in a society is discussed ambiguously. A considerable amount of research generally found that parental welfare participation may encourage the welfare dependency of future generations and thus perpetuate generational poverty cycles (Gottschalk 1992, Vartanian 1999, Pepper 2000, Page 2004). Public transfers prevent persons from developing their resources or to take advantage of existing opportunities. Human capital such as education and work experience is not valued, and there is little motivation to pursue full-time employment (Hill and Duncan 1987, Mayer 1997, Corak and Heisz 1999). At the other side public transfers are said to result in an overall improvement in the living standards of the poor (Ellwood and Summers 1986). In this view, public transfers and redistributive taxes might be dedicated to narrow the gap between the income of the parents so that the incomes of the children converge to the mean more quickly (Corak 2006). The paper aims to analyze the implications of public transfers on the intergenerational income inequality and poverty trends in Germany and the United States, <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> differing <b>concerning</b> welfare policy regimes, labor market settings and family role models. We analyze the pre- and post-government income of parent-child pairs in different time windows to address to non-linearities in the intergenerational income mobility (Hyson 2003...|$|R
