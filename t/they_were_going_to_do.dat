[...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do.

The reissue has different cover artwork, as well as four bonus tracks – the track listing of which was revealed on February 1. The bonus tracks are: a new song recorded especially for the reiussue, titled [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", two re-recorded songs that were originally featured on their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason – [...] "Heartless" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] – and a cover of the Kelly Clarkson song, [...] "Since U Been Gone".

500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On {{television}} broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at Wembley, and when they finally got to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours. However, Hart also stated that as bad as Smith's personal issues were, he [...] "sucked it up" [...] and hit every spot in the match.|$|E

2500|$|Filming for {{the second}} Hustle series took place in mid-2004, again in and around central London.

[...] "On the first series we didn't know each other... {{we were trying to}} work out what roles we were going to play and the scripts were still being written as we were shooting it; it was all a case of finding out what exactly Hustle was going to be.. second time around it was much easier, much quicker... when we were reading the script you could really hear the other actors doing their lines because you knew kind of how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them..." [...] With the success of the first series, Hustle's team of writers were able to be more inventive in creating new plots {{for the second}} six-episode run, including issues some of the characters had to deal with, and stories which could keep the audience guessing until the end.|$|E

2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have got to get it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'"

2500|$|As the {{television}} ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically {{during the fourth}} season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986–87 {{in a bid to}} win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie [...] "Dishpan Man" [...] Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained {{for the duration of the}} fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. [...] In what was supposed to be the final episode, [...] "The Grey Team" [...] (although [...] "Without Reservations" [...] was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. [...] The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, [...] "fini".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the filming}} of the Kung Fu TV movie began, there was some {{discussion}} {{as to whether or}} not an Asian actor should play Kwai Chang Caine. Bruce Lee was considered for the role. In 1971, Bruce Lee wasn't the cult film hero he later became for his roles in The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), Way of the Dragon (1972) and Enter the Dragon (1973). At that point he was best known as Kato on TV's Green Hornet (1966–1967) (Kung Fu guest actor Robert Ito reports that Lee hated the role of Kato because he [...] "thought it was so subservient"). [...] "In my eyes and in the eyes of Jerry Thorpe," [...] says Harvey Frand, [...] "David Carradine was always our first choice to play Caine. But there was some disagreement because the network was interested in a more muscular actor and the studio was interested in getting Bruce Lee." [...] Frand says Lee wouldn't have really been appropriate for the series—despite the fact that he went on to considerable success in the martial arts film world. The Kung Fu show needed a serene person, and Carradine was more appropriate for the role. Ed Spielman agrees: [...] "I liked David in the part. One of Japan's foremost Karate champions used to say that the only qualification that was needed to be trained in the martial arts was that you had to know how to dance. And on top of being an accomplished athlete and actor, David could dance." [...] Nonetheless, grumbling from the Asian community would have made sense, given the fact that major roles for Asian actors were almost nonexistent. James Hong, an actor on the show and ex-president of the Association of Asian/Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) says that at the time Asian actors felt that [...] "if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a so-called Asian hero on Kung Fu, then why don't they hire an Asian actor to play the lead? But then the show went on, we realized that it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community." [...] In fact, Hong says, Carradine had a good relationship with the Asian community.|$|E

2500|$|In early February 2014 Faygoluvers.net {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Insane Clown Posse, {{and they said that}} they hope they will work with some artists that they have been wanting to work with for a while. Also they were asked if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the second leg of The Mighty Death Pop! Tour, and they said that they will go on tour in 2014 but it won't be called The Mighty Death Pop! Tour. During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J's home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going {{to be back in the}} studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (7/23/2014 - 7/27/2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, /), along with a certification of authenticity signed by Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope, 6 tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014. In a July 6, 2014 interview Faygoluvers.net conducted with Jumpsteady, he stated that Psychopathic is currently working with some new supergroups. At the 2014 GOTJ during Anybody Killa's seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo have created a new group called The Have Nots. Insane Clown Posse have composed a group with Da Mafia 6ix called The Killjoy Club, and will be releasing their debut album titled Reindeer Games on September 2, 2014. ICP, DM6, Madchild, Jelly Roll and Mushroom Head plus others are to go on tour possibly titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] which will run from September 18, 2014 - October 31, 2014. ICP finally announced that they will release a Psypher featuring artists that are not signed to Psychopathic Records sometime before Hallowicked, including Madchild. Also announced Otis of AMB and DJ Paul will both release solo albums on Psychopathic records in 2015. On August 5, 2014 ICP released a promo flyer for their upcoming tour titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll from September 30, 2014 through October 31, 2014. The tour was originally scheduled to be a 45-date tour, and scheduled to kick off on September 18, 2014, but due to Madchild performing in Australia with his group Swollen Members for a mini tour until September 27, 2014, the tour will now kick off on September 30, 2014 Columbus, Ohio, and will conclude on ICP's 21st annual Hallowicked concert on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Psychopathic Records released a video promo for [...] "ShockFest" [...] in early August 2014. The tour is now scheduled to run from September 25, 2014, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and will conclude on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. In the booklet released with the Reindeer Games album were four flyers in promotion of new albums. The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck will be released [...] "sooner than you think". The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The third was for DJ Paul, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Master Of Evil and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records. In early October 2014 it was announced that [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] will be pushed back to a 2015 release creating speculation that Psychopathic will release the album.
