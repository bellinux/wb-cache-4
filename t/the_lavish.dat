5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} <b>the</b> <b>lavish</b> hand-colored film put it {{out of the reach of}} many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya.

An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass, rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set. While Collaborations presents {{only a portion of}} Shankar and Harrison's work together, music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the far-reaching cultural legacy of their partnership.|$|E
5|$|Méliès, {{working in}} {{collaboration}} with the stage director Victor de Cottens, designed An Adventurous Automobile Trip as an innovative Folies Bergère act combining stage performance and film, with a live prologue and epilogue used to frame the filmed sequence. After this version premiered on 31 December 1904, Méliès adapted the film to be a standalone release for general distribution in 1905. <b>The</b> <b>lavish</b> film, available in both black-and-white and hand-colored versions, was a popular and critical success both in France and in America. However, the film's high production values made it too expensive for many exhibitors, one of several factors that sent Méliès's career into decline.|$|E
40|$|Written {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} of Olive Pratt Rayner, {{also used for}} The Type-Writer Girl (1897), Rosalba: The Story of her Development (1899) is the last completed novel by prolific Canadian-born writer Grant Allen.

Perhaps more than his earlier novels, Rosalba can be seen as the ultimate exemplification of Allen’s evolutionist thought...|$|R

5|$|The El Badi Palace flanks {{the eastern}} side of the Kasbah. It was built by Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur after his success against the Portuguese at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. <b>The</b> <b>lavish</b> palace, which took around a quarter of a century to build, was funded by {{compensation}} from the Portuguese and African gold and sugar cane revenue. This allowed Carrara marble to be brought from Italy and other materials to be shipped from France, Spain and India. It is a larger version of the Alhambra's Court of the Lions. Although the palace is now a ruin with little left but the outer walls, the site has become the location of the annual Marrakech Folklore Festival and other events.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lavish</b> banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|With family estates in Scotland and England, Elizabeth's {{upbringing}} involved much travel.

The couple, especially Harriet, led vibrant social lives. She {{was a political}} hostess known for her friendship and position as Mistress of the Robes to the young Queen Victoria. In 1833, the 1st Duke died and Elizabeth's father succeeded as 2nd Duke of Sutherland, inheriting extensive property. The historian Eric Richards writes that {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century saw the height of the House of Sutherland's social and economic influence, with its wealth being derived from rents, various stocks, and dividends from transportation firms.|$|E

5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of <b>the</b> <b>lavish</b> media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade on Fifth Avenue for Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with {{the purchase of a}} Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and <b>the</b> <b>lavish</b> gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. <b>The</b> <b>lavish</b> ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
