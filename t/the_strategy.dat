30|$|As {{shown in}} Tables  6, 7, 8, <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> is <b>the</b> best <b>strategy</b> subject to DD_r̅ for all instances. <b>The</b> order-based <b>strategy</b> is <b>the</b> best <b>strategy</b> {{regarding}} c_r̅ for all instances. Both, the period-based (c_r̅ = 14.70 %) and <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> (c_r̅ = 7.38 %) result in higher costs compared to <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy.</b> However, <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy</b> does not {{ensure that the}} target fill rate is at least reached on average over all 30 repetitions and products. This results in rather high DD_r̅. <b>The</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> leads to lower c_r̅ and less DD_r̅ than <b>the</b> period-based <b>strategy</b> for all instances. Thus, <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> is superior to <b>the</b> period-based <b>strategy.</b> However, <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>strategies</b> is bi-criteria meaning {{that it is impossible}} to trade off an increase of c_r̅ and a decrease of DD_r̅. Hence, no clear conclusion regarding the stabilized-cycle and <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy</b> can be drawn without preference information of the decision-maker.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> {{leads to}} similar {{results for the}} HPPS as {{observed}} in the medium-term problem. This means that almost no downside deviations of actual fill rates from the target fill rates exist {{at the end of}} a reporting period, while there is only a moderate increase of costs in comparison to <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy.</b> As <b>the</b> period-based <b>strategy</b> results in higher costs and higher downside deviations than <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> for all studied instances, <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> is superior to <b>the</b> period-based <b>strategy.</b> Since <b>the</b> evaluation of the performance is bi-criterial, no direct comparison of <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> and <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy</b> can be made without preference information of the decision-maker. However, for some instances we are able to show that <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> dominates <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy.</b> For <b>the</b> other instances, <b>the</b> stabilized-cycle <b>strategy</b> provides at least solutions with a smaller downside deviation and only a minor increase of costs compared to <b>the</b> order-based <b>strategy.</b>|$|R

The reason behind leaving that aspect is because the teacher finds it hard to provide token economies for each behavior and it will be better by just giving them complements right after the behavior occurs.

40|$|Sustainable {{stormwater}} {{management strategies}} such as stormwater wetland, swale, porous pavement and green roof are about the replication of hydrology cycles to reduce quantity and {{to improve the quality}} of stormwater through stormwater infrastructures. There are many strategies available, however, little discussion on the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> with <b>the</b> hydrology cycles made the implementation less successful in managing the problem caused by stormwater such as flash flood and water pollution. Hence, this research aims to review <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> of sustainable stormwater management. Two objectives formulated are (i) to identify <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> of sustainable stormwater management, and (ii) to identify the relationship of <b>the</b> identified <b>strategies</b> with hydrology cycles. Online journal, forum discussion and e-mail interview were used as methods of data collection in this qualitative research. Five steps of descriptive comparative analysis were used to analyse the data. Consequently, the researcher had identified 18 <b>strategies</b> and listed <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> in priority order. <b>The</b> 18 <b>strategies</b> are urban stream reclamation, tree canopy cover, change impervious to pervious cover, vegetated surface channel, rainwater harvesting, stream daylighting, infiltration basin, disconnection of impervious area, green roof, modification of soil, stormwater wetland and bioretention pond, barrier system, narrow street, rain garden and greenway. <b>The</b> identified <b>strategies</b> were listed in priority order based on relationship with seven hydrology cycles, which are interception, infiltration, surface runoff, depression storage, evapotranspiration, groundwater flow and interflow. <b>The</b> <b>strategies</b> were analysed with hydrology cycles to ensure the sustainability factors in listing <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> to manage <b>the</b> stormwater...|$|R
