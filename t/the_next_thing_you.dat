500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked.

In coorse, therefore, they carefully tries to foller wots true--though I'm bound for to say they do git off the track now an' then. Well, if it's so with such like, it's much more so with religion. Wot then? W'y, stand by your colours, through thick an' thin. Hold on to the Bible! That's the watchword. That's your sheet-anchor--though you haven't seed one yet.

In this interview with Ebenezar Asaah of the World Agroforestry Centre in Cameroon, Martha Chindong asks what practical steps communities can follow {{to set up a}} nursery of their own, closer to home. IN:	?Well a few simple steps that [...] . OUT:	?and meet such an order. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 40 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martha Chindong speaking to Ebenezar Asaah of the World Agroforestry Centre in Cameroon. If you want to set up your own nursery, make sure you have a clear idea of what purpose you want it to serve, and enough space for all the stores you will need to set up. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Asaah	Well a few simple steps that a community could use to set up a community nursery. The first thing is they have to have a very clear objective of {{what they want to do}} about setting a nursery, because a nursery, it should be like a long term venture, it should not just be a short one-off thing. That is the first <b>thing,</b> so <b>you</b> have to define it. They could think about producing plants and others could come and buy. So you have to do some prospection have a long-term view of what you want to do, having a clear objective. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> community should be willing to participate materially and equally in kind, because this is very important for the ownership of that nursery. If the community can spare their land, they come in and work with you, and what they don?t have that is what you bring in. You find that there is a win-win situation. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> is that <b>you</b> have to identify an ideal site. The most suitable site should be where you have a permanent water source. And the area or the site should be secure. Then there are other issues like constructing the shed house of the nursery, especially if you are going to carry out vegetative propagation you will need propagators. We are going to have areas to germinate seed so you have germinations beds, you are going to have weaning sheds after your plants start getting mature before you plant them into the field you need to wean them gradually. And then of course you need a store, a secured store where you can store your small equipment which you use like the wheel barrows, the spades. Chindong	So who takes the decisions, who makes the decision as regards to what type of fruit trees we are going to plant in the nursery when it comes to a community nursery? Asaah	In a community nursery the decision rests on the community. You find that the choice of the species is often guided by the farmers and the market forces of the products. It has to fulfil his nutritional benefits first and it is the excess that he is now thinking of selling. Those that want to develop a long term nursery they have to run it as a farmer enterprise. And in that way they have to have a clear vision of what they want, that is why we talk of clear objectives. And so that is why we give them that training to develop their business plans, we support them to have knowledge on book keeping so that they could record the plans they produce, and now from the business plan they can actually predict what they are going to produce and respect if there is a command, somebody places an order of plants, they can actually respect and meet such an order. End of track. How to make the most of your nursery...|$|R
