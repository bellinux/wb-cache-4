5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> <b>into</b> more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{computer}} age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions.

A result of the new bindings is a third division dealing with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings. With the digital age, personal computers have replaced the pen and paper based accounting that used to drive {{most of the work}} in the stationery binding industry.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the First World War {{and until}} 1920 Harvey, in the Quaker tradition, engaged {{personally}} in relief {{work in the}} war zone in France, {{on behalf of the}} War Victims’ Relief Committee of the Society of Friends. But Harvey's dilemma over support for the government, as distinct from his religious beliefs, surfaced when he and another Liberal Quaker MP, Arnold Stephenson Rowntree, helped to draft the section of the Military Service Act 1916 that provided for the possibility of conscientious objectors being required to perform work of national importance as a condition of exemption from service in the army. There was disagreement among Quakers about the sort of service, if any, which conscientious objectors should be asked to do, and Harvey and Rowntree were accused of arrogating to themselves the right to specify what objectors might do and of misrepresenting to the authorities {{the extent to which they}} could speak for Quaker opinion. He also served as a member of the Pelham Committee (formally, the Committee on Work of National Importance), the body charged in March 1916 with trying to find suitable civilian occupations for conscientious objectors prepared to undertake the work of national importance he had helped <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the Military Service Act.|$|E

25|$|The Dæmons began {{life as an}} {{audition}} scene for the companion Jo Grant. The audition sequence went on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> <b>into</b> episode four. Producer Barry Letts was keen to write for the show and decided that a story dealing in black magic would be interesting as well as frightening. Script editor Terrance Dicks had reservations however, stating that people may view it as Satanist, {{and so it was}} reworked as strictly scientific with occultist themes. The Master was originally intended to worship the demon in a church set, standing on an altar. However, owing to fears that this might upset religious viewers, the scenes were reset in a crypt. This was subsequently revised again, and the crypt was called a cavern, although the set clearly resembled a church crypt. Letts initially intended to write the story himself but found himself short of time due to producership duties. His wife suggested a friend of hers, Robert Sloman, who was a playwright and journalist. Together they worked on the script in the evening after work. At the time, however, the BBC frowned upon production staff writing for their own series and so Letts and Sloman decided on the pseudonym Guy Leopold - Sloman's son and Letts' middle name respectively. The working title for this story was The Demons, which was commissioned on 17 December 1970. The scripts were completed by mid-February 1971 and worked on by Dicks, who had barely completed work on them by the time the story went into pre-production in March.|$|E
