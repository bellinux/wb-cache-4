5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being called by God, Latter Day Saint theology holds that a person must be given priesthood authority by one who currently holds it.

25|$|Another common {{element of}} Wiccan {{morality}} is the Law of Threefold Return {{which holds that}} whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> with triple force, or with equal force {{on each of the}} three levels of body, mind and spirit, similar to the eastern idea of karma. The Wiccan Rede was most likely introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente, one of his High Priestesses. The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by Monique Wilson and further popularised by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca.|$|E

If medically suitable, the allocation system is subverted, and the organ is given <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> In the United States, there are various lengths of waiting times due to the different availabilities of organs in different UNOS regions. In other countries such as the UK, only medical factors and the position on the waiting list can affect who receives the organ.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{being able}} to {{function}} within a Discourse may carry advantages in different situations. For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> In the United States, those are all Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse community is not inherently better than another; however, power within a society may be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Aquinas {{claimed that}} X’s soul was X’s only {{substantial}} form, although X also had numerous accidental forms {{that accounted for}} X’s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which {{in the case of}} a human being is rational capacity. He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms. However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person. He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.|$|E
25|$|Every {{person with}} a Swedish {{national}} identification number must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang got a Betalningsanmärkning since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the Stockholm congestion tax. At the time, {{he was living in}} the USA training for his first Space Shuttle mission and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.|$|E

25|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{feared the}} Court's ruling {{would limit the}} ability of police to combat {{domestic}} violence. Chief Justice Roberts {{also noted that the}} purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to protect individual privacy, but any person who shares a dwelling (or, as Chief Justice Roberts points out, a locker or a hard drive) with another person may anticipate that the other person sharing access to their belongings might turn them over to authorities. In short, to share a home with someone is to surrender privacy as <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person,</b> who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in the police car, as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{utilitarian}} {{principle of}} seeking the greatest {{good for the}} greatest number – economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, {{is an example of}} reduced [...] "distributive efficiency" [...] within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. [...] An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person,</b> such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person ("the additional dollar") decreases as a person becomes richer. [...] From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the use of}} paper, the Chinese used coins {{that were}} circular, with a {{rectangular}} hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given {{a slip of paper}} recording how much money he had with that person. If he showed the paper <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> he could regain his money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called [...] "jiaozi" [...] originated from these promissory notes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advertising}} and marketing campaign for Paranormal State broke new ground. In November 2007, a six-story billboard was erected {{at the corner of}} Prince and Mulberry Streets in New York City by [...] Behind the billboard were two directional audio (or audioSpotlights) which produce a highly focused beam of sound. Passers-by who walked directly {{in the path of the}} sound would hear spooky, disembodied voices whispering suggestive messages such as [...] "What's that?" [...] and [...] "Who's there? It's not your imagination." [...] But someone standing next <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> would hear nothing. The billboard had a dramatic effect on people coming within range of the [...] "cone of sound" [...] created by the directional audio speakers. The billboard was apparently the first commercial use of the technology on a billboard. A video of the installation can be seen here.|$|E

It is not {{the intent of the}} artist to deal with any one particular issue, but to take a generic or holistic view. In doing this, the message is read into the work, by the viewer, and according <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>persons</b> agenda. This is a multimedia production with elements of digital video, 3 d animation, audio and sculpture in the round. The work draws heavily on the surrealists and in particular the works of Magritte and Dali. The work is also the result of experimentation with the projection of virtual sculptures and its almost holographic effect when projected onto a black wall...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} for its success was White's {{approach}} to teaching. He emphasized personal vision and style over any particular school or movement. Students were assigned [...] "problems" [...] and asked to create images that evoked particular concepts or sentiments, such as [...] "Innocence" [...] or [...] "Thanksgiving". He also required students to experiment, much like he and Stieglitz, by producing several kinds of prints of the same image. Of the 30 hours of instruction offered each week at the school, 14 were taken up by a single class - [...] "The Art of Photography", taught by White. During these sessions White stressed that the primary thing his students had to learn was [...] "the capacity to see." [...] He never encouraged or permitted competition among his students by comparing the work of one against another; each person's work was approached totally in relation <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher John Taurek {{also argued}} {{that the idea of}} adding {{happiness}} or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant. Taurek's basic concern comes down to this: we cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies. [...] "I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind," [...] he wrote (p.304). He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. [...] There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: [...] who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? [...] "Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss" [...] (p.307). Parfit and others have criticized Taurek's line, and it continues to be discussed.|$|E
2500|$|Members of a {{tribunal}} {{should not}} communicate independently or privately to any material witness. If they do so, {{the fact that}} communication has occurred must be disclosed to the parties concerned right away. The justification for this rule {{is that it would}} be unfair for a person to be judged on an issue based on information obtained by an adjudicator which is unknown <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> In Re Low Fook Cheng Patricia (1998), a lawyer appealed to set aside the penalty for misconduct imposed on her by the Law Society of Singapore. The appeal was based on the ground that the chairman of the Inquiry Committee had contacted a witness to enquire if the witness could assist the committee in its inquiry, but this was not made known to the appellant. Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck considered such an act of private communication with a material witness as [...] "pierc the veritable armour of impartiality which every tribunal exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must don". Thus, the penalty imposed by the Law Society was set aside.|$|E

50|$|This is {{very similar}} to market share.

That is, market share is the aggregate or macro version of the patronage concentration ratio. Or alternatively, patronage concentration is the micro equivalent of market share.|$|R
