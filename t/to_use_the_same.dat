5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

30|$|An {{adaptive}} beamformer obtains directive response {{mainly by}} analyzing the statistical information contained in the array data, not by utilizing the spatial information directly.

5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2013, the Jeddah Economic Company (JEC) {{announced}} that it had appointed an EC Harris/Mace joint venture team to project manage the iconic Jeddah Tower project. The team will be providing project, commercial and design management for the Jeddah Tower development. CEO of JEC, Waleed Abduljaleel Batterjee said that the reason Mace was hired is <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> team that worked for The Shard in London.

50|$|CRN {{requires}} synchronization of {{the random}} number streams, which ensures {{that in addition}} <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> random numbers <b>to</b> simulate all configurations, a specific random number used for a specific purpose in one configuration is <b>used</b> for exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> purpose in all other configurations. For example, in queueing theory, if we are comparing two different configurations of tellers in a bank, we would want the (random) time of arrival of the Nth customer <b>to</b> be generated <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> draw from a random number stream for both configurations.|$|R
50|$|Chimpanzees {{have been}} known <b>to</b> <b>use</b> tools {{for as long as}} they have been studied. Andrew Whiten found that {{chimpanzees}} not only use tools, but also conform <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> method as <b>the</b> majority of individuals in the group.

5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route as had been used for the trials. In {{order to make the}} event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|Tumbleweeds, {{which are}} the {{above-ground}} portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and has gained {{a reputation as a}} noxious weed.

50|$|Annulenes are {{completely}} conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons. They have the general formula CnHn (when n {{is an even}} number) or CnHn+1 (when n is an odd number). The IUPAC naming conventions are that annulenes with 7 or more carbon atoms are named as nannulene, where n {{is the number of}} carbon atoms in their ring, though sometimes the smaller annulenes are referred <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> notation, and benzene is sometimes referred to simply as annulene.|$|R

5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, he would have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, {{but he could not}} get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly {{away from the}} main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies {{to talk to one}} another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months before}} signing a full {{contract}} with Giant/Rockville, Uncle Tupelo recorded the tracks for No Depression over ten days in January 1990 at Fort Apache South, a musician-run {{studio in the}} Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. As the trio could not afford the cost of recording at a twenty-four track studio in nearby Cambridge, they settled on the cheaper Fort Apache studio. The album cost US$3,500 to produce, $1,000 of which went to in-house producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie. The band was interested in working with Slade and Kolderie after hearing their production of Dinosaur Jr.'s album Bug. The producers allowed Farrar <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> 1961 Gibson Les Paul guitar that J. Mascis used on Bug, which gave the power chords on No Depression a richer tone.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic look and feel and an advanced physics engine. When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate {{that it would be a}} major advance from the previous games. The Havok physics engine, previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed them to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
50|$|Airline mega mergers, {{in markets}} {{such as the}} United States, have deemed it {{necessary}} to break conventional flight numbering schemes. Organizations such as IATA, ICAO, ARC, as well as CRS systems and the FAA's ATC systems limit flight numbers to four digits (0001 through 9999). The pool of available flight numbers has been outstripped by demand for them by emergent mega-carriers. As such, some carriers have resorted <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> flight number for back-and-forth flights (e.g. DCA-PBI-DCA), or in other cases carriers have resorted to assigning a single flight number to an eight-leg flight (e.g. ICT-DAL-HOU-MDW-OMA-DEN-ABQ-LAS-BDL).|$|R
