This risk had been highlighted in July 2007, when the CEO gave a presentation on Zimki at OSCON 2007 which announced that Zimki would no longer be open sourced and discussed the future of what was then called Framework as a Service (later renamed to Platform as a Service) covering the importance of a market of providers based upon an open source reference model.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s, rapid {{advances}} {{in the field of}} jet propulsion, particularly in terms of increased thrust and compact engine units, had contributed to an increased belief in the <b>technical</b> <b>viability</b> of vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) aircraft, particularly within Western Europe and the United States. During 1950s and 1960s, multiple programmes in Britain, France, and the United States were initiated; likewise, aviation companies inside West Germany were keen not to be left out of this emerging technology. Shortly after 1957, the year in which the post-Second World War ban upon West Germany operating and developing combat aircraft was lifted, German aviation firms Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Heinkel, and Messerschmitt, having also been allowed to resume their own activities that same year, received an official request from the German Federal Government that urged them to perform investigative work on the topic of VTOL aircraft and to produce concept designs.|$|E
50|$|The Transport Ministry’s {{working group}} {{reported}} in December 2013 that a tax proportional to road use would implement transport and environment policies better than current fixed taxes on motoring, although collection {{costs would be}} many times higher.

However, it argued that buses and lorries should be exempted from road use charges {{on the grounds that}} the rise in costs could not be offset by cutting other heavy vehicle road taxes, which were already close to the minimum set in the EU’s vignette directive. For private cars the report looked at the implications of fixed and regional kilometre charges but did not consider market or other methods for responding to varying local congestion.

5000|$|Sensor-based sorting is {{a coarse}} {{particle}} separation technology applied in mining for the dry separation of bulk materials. The functional principle does not limit {{the technology to}} any kind of segment or mineral application but makes the <b>technical</b> <b>viability</b> mainly depend on the liberation characteristics at the size range 25 - 100 mm, which is usually sorted. If physical liberation is present there is a good potential that one of the sensors available on industrial scale sorting machines can differentiate between valuable and non-valuable particles. The separation is based on features measured with a detection technology that are used to derive a yes/no decision for actuation of usually pneumatic impulses. Sensor-based sorting is a disruptive technology in the mining industry which is universally applicable for all commodities. A comprehensive study examines both the technology's potential and its limitations, whilst providing a framework for application development and evaluation. All relevant aspects, from sampling to plant design and integration into mining and mineral processing systems, are covered. Other terminologeis used in the industry include ore sorting, automated sorting, electronic sorting, [...] and [...] optical sorting.|$|E
