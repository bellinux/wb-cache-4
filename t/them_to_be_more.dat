5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into {{a wide variety of}} forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{brings a}} {{cockroach}} {{from the hotel}} room to Berenbaum, who thinks it may be mechanical. Mulder then visits the nearby Dr. Ivanov, a wheelchair-bound scientist who works on insect-like robots. The two discuss the possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences could send robotic probes to study other planets. After inspecting the Mulder's specimen, Ivanov is rendered speechless; he informs Mulder that the specimen is, technology-wise, vastly superior to anything he's ever seen. Scully arrives in the town at a convenience store, finding the residents succumbing to panic over the roaches. She attempts to calm the people down, however the store-goers frantically flee after two scuffling patrons knock over a display of chocolate candies, believing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> roaches. Meanwhile, Mulder, while departing Ivanov's lab, catches another roach to bring to Berenbaum, but this time, she concludes {{that it is a}} seemingly normal cockroach. Scully finds out that Eckerle was researching dung-derived methane as an alternative fuel source, and had been importing animal dung that may have introduced the roaches to the area. Upon hearing this, Mulder speculates that the roaches are actually extraterrestrial robotic probes that are capable of consuming dung—an abundant resource already exploited by some species of roaches—to generate methane as a source of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Within clade Synapsida, Dimetrodon {{is part of}} the clade Sphenacodontia, {{which was}} first {{proposed}} as an early synapsid group in 1940 by paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price, along with the groups Ophiacodontia and Edaphosauria. All three groups are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. Romer and Price distinguished them primarily by postcranial features such as the shapes of limbs and vertebrae. Ophiacodontia was considered the most primitive group because its members appeared the most reptilian, and Sphenacodontia was the most advanced because its members appeared the most like a group called Therapsida, which included the closest relatives to mammals. Romer and Price placed another group of early synapsids called varanopids within Sphenacodontia, considering <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> primitive than other sphenacodonts like Dimetrodon. They thought varanopids and Dimetrodon-like sphenacodonts were closely related because both groups were carnivorous, although varanopids are much smaller and more lizard-like, lacking sails.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{irritation}} was the regional assemblies, {{which had been}} organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions.

In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.|$|E
25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many {{of the children in the}} study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the people}} in these {{countries}} have become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E

25|$|Wolf hunting {{opponents have}} argued that wolves serve vital {{functions}} in areas where they are sympatric with game herds. By culling unhealthy animals, wolves allegedly keep game herds healthy. Opponents state that without wolves, prey populations swell unnaturally, unbalancing ecosystems whilst simultaneously sapping wildlife management resources. In the Iberian Peninsula for example, conservationists consider wolves to be beneficial because they keep wild boar populations stable, thus allowing some respite to the endangered capercaillie populations which suffer greatly from boar predation. In Yellowstone National Park, wolves were shown to have a hugely positive effect on general ecological health, and by extension, that of game herds. Game animals in Yellowstone killed off all young, reachable tree saplings, destroying beaver, songbird, insect, fish and amphibian populations, and threatening to starve themselves via overexploitation. Wolves reduced game animal numbers and forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> mobile, allowing more saplings to grow and allowing the populations of aforementioned animals to increase.|$|E
25|$|Owen's {{detailed}} memoirs {{and descriptions}} require laborious attention in reading, {{on account of}} their complex terminology and ambiguous modes of expression. The fact that very little of his terminology has found universal favour causes <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> generally neglected than they otherwise would be. At the same time, {{it must be remembered}} that he was a pioneer in concise anatomical nomenclature and, so far at least as the vertebrate skeleton is concerned, his terms were based on a carefully reasoned philosophical scheme, which first clearly distinguished between the now-familiar phenomena of analogy and homology. Owen's theory of the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton (1848), subsequently illustrated also by his little work On the Nature of Limbs (1849), regarded the vertebrate frame as consisting of a series of fundamentally identical segments, each modified according to its position and functions. Much of it was fanciful and failed when tested by the facts of embryology, which Owen systematically ignored, throughout his work. However, though an imperfect and distorted view of certain great truths, it possessed a distinct value {{at the time of its}} conception.|$|E
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E

25|$|By the 1820s, many Indians (they were {{referred}} to as Klings, or Keling, which {{was used as a}} derogatory word, much as the word Coolie) were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life. European merchants and businessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting them for work as a cheap source of labour. The British began shipping Indians to colonies around the world, including British Mauritius, British Fiji, British Natal, British East Africa, British Tanganyika, British Somaliland, British Bechuanaland, British Seychelles, British Uganada, British Northern Rhodesia, British Rhodesia, British Nyasaland, British Guiana, British Trinidad and Tobago, British Jamaica, British Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, British Honduras, Saint Kitts and Nevis, British Barbados, the rest of the British West Indies, and British Malaya. The Dutch also shipped workers to labor on the plantations on Dutch Surinam the Netherlands Antilles, and the Dutch East Indies. The French had also shipped laborers to Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, the rest of the French West Indies, and Réunion. A system of agents was used to infiltrate the rural villages of India and recruit labourers. They would often deceive the credulous workers about the great opportunities that awaited them for their own material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but also from Tamil Nadu and other areas to the south of the country. Indians had faced a great number of social and economic disasters, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> eager than other groups to leave India.

I wanted something more terrifying and more omnipotent." [...] Three designs for the Dark Troopers were produced for Dark Forces. Lucasfilm licensing department initially rejected two of the designs for looking too much out of character, so Chin produced new designs which were ultimately approved. The development team collaborated with staff at Skywalker Ranch for the sounds, music, and costumes used in the cutscenes.|$|E
