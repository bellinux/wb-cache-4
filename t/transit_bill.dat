2500|$|The {{barriers}} to 2007 {{passage of a}} bill were the requirement that a 3/5ths supermajority of the legislators was needed {{to pass a bill}} after May 31 to be immediately effective, the Governor had threatened to veto a bill that included a sales tax increase, and many legislators tied a <b>transit</b> <b>bill</b> to a capital plan and a casino bill to fund that capital plan.

40|$|The 95 th {{percentile}} {{method for}} calculating a customer’s billable transit volume {{has been the}} industry standard used by transit providers {{for over a decade}} due to its simplicity. We recently showed [1] that 95 th percentile billing can be unfair, in that it does not reflect a customer’s contribution to the provider’s peak load. The 95 th per-centile method is also inflexible, as it does not allow a provider to offer incentives to customers that contribute minimally to the provider’s peak load. In this paper we propose a new <b>transit</b> <b>billing</b> optimization framework that is fair, flexible and computationally inexpensive. Our approach is based on the Provision Ratio, a met-ric that estimates the contribution of a customer to the provider’s peak traffic.

40|$|Abstract—Economic {{forces behind}} the Internet {{evolution}} have diversified {{the types of}} ISP (Internet Service Provider) intercon-nections. In particular, settlement-free peering and paid peering proved themselves as effective means for reducing ISP costs. In this paper, we propose T 4 P (Transit for Peering), {{a new type of}} hybrid bilateral ISP relationships that continues the Internet trend towards more flexible interconnections at lower costs. With a T 4 P interconnection, one ISP compensates the other ISP for their peering by providing this other ISP with a partial-transit service. In comparison to paid peering, T 4 P is able to reduce the combined transit/peering costs of an ISP due to the subadditive nature of <b>transit</b> <b>billing.</b> As a cost-effective alternative to existing interconnection types, T 4 P expands and strengthens the connectivity of the Internet, e. g., between content and eyeball networks. After analyzing incentives of ISPs to adopt T 4 P, we use real traffic data from several IXPs (Internet eXchange Points) to quantify the T 4 P economic benefits. Our evaluation confirms the promising potential of T 4 P. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Prefix deaggregation is {{recognized}} as a steady long-lived phenomenon at the interdomain level, despite its well-known negative effects for the community. The advertisement of more-specific prefixes provides network operators with a fine-grained method to control the interdomain ingress traffic. Moreover, customer networks combining this mechanism with selective advertisements may decrease their monthly transit traffic bill and potentially impact the business of their providers. In this paper, we develop a methodology for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to monitor new occurrences of prefix deaggre-gation within their customer base. Moreover, the ISPs can detect on their own when deaggregation may decrease the <b>transit</b> <b>bill</b> of their customer networks. We first examine the ISP’s BGP routing data for new cases of prefix deaggregation generated by customers. Then, we check for selective advertisements of the newly generated prefixes using external routing data. We look beyond the incentives for deploying this type of strategy and instead we examine its economic impact. We exemplify the proposed methodology on {{a complete set of}} data including routing, traffic, topological and billing information provided by a major Japanese ISP and we discuss the implications of the obtained results.

Q 3 : Are firms in TODs more resilient to economic downturns? Q 4 : Do TODs create more affordable housing measured as H+T? Q 5 : Do TODs improve job accessibility for those living in or near them? The first question investigates which types of industries are actually transit oriented. Best planning practices call for a mix of uses focused around housing and retail, but analysis provides some surprises. The second question tests the economic development effects of transit—do locations provided with transit actually experience employment growth? The third question is intended to determine the ability of employers near transit to resist losing jobs; or having lost jobs, to rapidly regain them. The fourth research question confronts the issue of affordable housing and transit. <b>Transit</b> is often <b>billed</b> {{as a way to}} provide affordable housing by matching low-cost housing with employment. Yet proximity to transit stations is also expected to raise land values. Proximity to transit, however, may increase actual affordability, regardless of increases in housing costs, because of the reduction in transportation costs. The final research question considers the relationship between workplace and residence locations. To be able to commute by transit, both the workplace and home must be near transit. Effective transit should increase both the number and share of workers who work and live along the transit corridor...|$|R
40|$|Many {{public transit}} {{agencies}} are considering direct acceptance of contactless credit and debit cards (collectively contactless bankcards) at gates in rail stations and on board buses. Concerns {{have been raised}} about riders {{who may not have}} or may not want to use contactless bankcards for transit fare payments. This thesis presents contactless prepaid cards as a potential fare payment option {{to meet the needs of}} these riders, and assesses customer attitudes toward contactless prepaid cards and bankcards. Two case studies are presented of transit agencies planning to implement contactless bankcard fare collection systems: Transport for London and the Chicago Transit Authority. A framework for evaluation of transit prepaid card options addresses two independent policy decisions: card function, or how the prepaid card may be used, and program management, the companies that partner with transit agencies to provide prepaid cards. The two card function options are: open loop cards, accepted at any merchant, or closed loop cards, used only for transit. Five possible program management options are addressed: the <b>transit</b> agency, <b>bill</b> payment companies, prepaid card companies, general payment card companies, and financial institutions. Options are analyzed along three primary dimensions: customer experience, cost, and geographic coverage of card servicing locations. The results show that closed loop and open loop cards may potentially have comparable costs for both the Chicago Transit Authority and Transport for London, although there is substantial uncertainty since no programs have yet been implemented. The cost and revenue uncertainties are higher for open loop cards than for closed loop cards. For all program management options, both transit agencies appear to face a tradeoff between costs and geographic coverage. Transit agency survey data is used to assess demand for contactless prepaid and bankcards. The results show that a small percentage of riders lacks both credit and debit cards and may have to use prepaid cards. Moreover, the majority of riders in London prefer closed loop prepaid cards, and most riders in Chicago prefer current fare media over bankcards. Discrete choice models are used to analyze factors influencing the choice between bankcards, prepaid cards, and other fare media for riders in London and Chicago. While trends among ridership groups are not strong, age and availability of payment instruments appear to influence fare media choice. by Candace Elizabeth Brakewood. Thesis (S.

40|$|Mención Internacional en el título de doctorThe {{performance}} of the global routing system is vital to thousands of entities operating the Autonomous Systems (ASes) which make up the Internet. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is currently responsible for the exchange of reachability information and the selection of paths according to their specified routing policies. BGP thus enables traffic to flow from any point to another connected to the Internet. The manner traffic flows if often influenced by entities in the Internet according to their preferences. The latter are implemented {{in the form of}} routing policies by tweaking BGP configurations. Routing policies are usually complex and aim to achieve a myriad goals, including technical, economic and political purposes. Additionally, individual network managers need to permanently adapt to the interdomain routing changes and, by engineering the Internet traffic, optimize the use of their network. Despite the flexibility offered, the implementation of routing policies is a complicated process in itself, involving fine-tuning operations. Thus, it is an error-prone task and operators might end up with faulty configurations that impact the efficacy of their strategies or, more importantly, their revenues. Withal, even when correctly defining legitimate routing policies, unforeseen interactions between ASes have been observed to cause important disruptions that affect the global routing system. The main reason behind this resides {{in the fact that the}} actual inter-domain routing is the result of the interplay of many routing policies from ASes across the Internet, possibly bringing about a different outcome than the one expected. In this thesis, we perform an extensive analysis of the intricacies emerging from the complex netting of routing policies at the interdomain level, in the context of the current operational status of the Internet. Abundant implications on the way traffic flows in the Internet arise from the convolution of routing policies at a global scale, at times resulting in ASes using suboptimal ill-favored paths or in the undetected propagation of configuration errors in routing system. We argue here that monitoring prefix visibility at the interdomain level can be used to detect cases of faulty configurations or backfired routing policies, which disrupt the functionality of the routing system. We show that the lack of global prefix visibility can offer early warning signs for anomalous events which, despite their impact, often remain hidden from state of the art tools. Additionally, we show that such unintended Internet behavior not only degrades the efficacy of the routing policies implemented by operators, causing their traffic to follow ill-favored paths, but can also point out problems in the global connectivity of prefixes. We further observe that majority of prefixes suffering from limited visibility at the interdomain level is a set of more-specific prefixes, often used by network operators to fulfill binding traffic engineering needs. One important task achieved through the use of routing policies for traffic engineering is the control and optimization of the routing function in order to allow the ASes to engineer the incoming traffic. The advertisement of more-specific prefixes, also known as prefix deaggregation, provides network operators with a fine-grained method to control the interdomain ingress traffic, given that the longest-prefix match rule over-rides any other routing policy applied to the covering lessspecific prefixes. Nevertheless, however efficient, this traffic engineering tool comes with a cost, which is usually externalized to the entire Internet community. Prefix deaggregation is a known reason for the artificial inflation of the BGP routing table, which can further affect the scalability of the global routing system. Looking past the main motivation for deploying deaggregation in the first place, we identify and analyze here the economic impact of this type of strategy. We propose a general Internet model to analyze the effect that advertising more-specific prefixes has on the incoming transit traffic burstiness. We show that deaggregation combined with selective advertisements (further defined as strategic deaggregation) has a traffic stabilization side-effect, which translates into a decrease of the <b>transit</b> traffic <b>bill.</b> Next, we develop a methodology for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to monitor general occurrences of deaggregation within their customer base. Furthermore, the ISPs can detect selective advertisements of deaggregated prefixes, and thus identify customers which may impact the business of their providers. We apply the proposed methodology on a complete set of data including routing, traffic, topological and billing information provided by an operational ISP and we discuss the obtained results.
