Sawmills often {{invest in a}} new machine center and then fi nd out that the processing bottleneck just moves somewhere else. Our approach was specifi cally designed to investigate the effects of such changes on the entire system. We determined that the trim-mer was the system bottleneck when both the small log and large log lines were running concomitantly. Under base case conditions, the model predicted an average board output of 13, 147 boards. An increase in the processing capability of the trimmer resulted in a shift of the bottleneck from the small log line to the large log line (at the edger). This bottleneck shift was further investigated and, by allowing the simulation model to manipulate machine settings for the trimmer and edger, {{it was able to}} maximize the modeled average board output to 17, 996 boards per shift (when edger set up times were not considered) and 16, 708 boards per shift (with edger setup times included).

An alternative technique to traditional shaping methods, such as deep-drawing and spinning, is electrohydraulic forming (EHF). In EHF, half-cells are obtained through ultrahigh-speed deformation of blank sheets, using shockwaves induced in water by a pulsed electrical discharge. With respect to traditional methods, such a highly dynamic process can yield interesting results {{in terms of}} effectiveness, repeatability, final shape precision, higher formability, and reduced springback. In this paper, the first results of EHF on high purity niobium are presented and discussed. The simulations performed in order to master the multiphysics phenomena of EHF and to adjust its process parameters are presented. The microstructures of niobium half-cells produced by EHF and by spinning have been compared in terms of damage created in the material during the forming operation. The damage was assessed through hardness measurements, residual resistivity ratio (RRR) measurements, and electron backscattered diffraction analyses. It was found that EHF does not worsen the damage of the material during forming and instead, {{some areas of the}} half-cell have shown lower damage compared to spinning.

Paclobutrazol at rates of 0, 1. 25, 2. 50 and 3. 75 g L- 1 were soil drenched at 30 days after the plants were trimmed and new shoots were produced. Paclobutrazol significantly reduced plant height and leaf area but increased the leaf area index. Reduced photosynthetic rates were recorded with the treated plants as compared to the control plants. In addition, paclobutrazol at 3. 75 g L- 1 significantly reduced the transpiration rate as compared with the control plants and plants treated with 1. 25 g L- 1 of paclobutrazol. However, stomatal conductance was not affected significantly by paclobutrazol. The growth inhibition effect of paclobutrazol reduced the trimming activity in S. myrtifolium.

Objective: To assess the hearing status of the grass trimming workers in KB and the nearby areas and to determine the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among them. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. The source population were from grass trimming worker works under USM Health Campus, Majlis Perbandaran Kota Bharu (MPKB), Majlis Daerah Pasir Puteh, Bachok, Ketereh and Tumpat. The data was collected at HUSM /ORL-HNS outpatient clinic to fill the Proforma, otoscopic examination and hearing tests. Hearing tests consist of pure tone audiometry, tympanogram and distortion product otoacoustic emission. Results: A total of 77 grass trimming workers participate in this study. All of them were male with age range from 20 - 53 years old with majority of them fall in age group of 40 - 50 years old. Two of the subjects were excluded as they have history of working in noisy job before and for at least 10 years. None of them use any protecting hearing device. Duration of work of grass trimmers were in between 1 to 33 years. The daily work was 4 - 5 hours with time of rest in between we found that 62 out 75 grass (82. 7 %) trimming worker have noise induced hearing loss with characteristic notch at 6 kHz, 4 kHz and 3 kHz. The noise induced hearing loss occurred in workers exposed to noise as early as two years in this job. The intensity of the noise from the machine is in between 91. 3 to 100. 7 dB in a fluctuant manner. The left ear was the predominant side that was affected by hearing loss. All of the subjects was having mild hearing loss. Conclusion: The study showed that grass trimming job have occupational hazards of noise induced hearing loss. It occurs with one to two years working without any hearing protection device. The dip at 6 kHz is a significant early sign for noise exposure. We strongly recommend that all the workers use the hearing protection device while doing grass trimming...|$|E

40|$|The {{technological}} and metallurgical requirements of material for highgradient superconducting cavities are described. High-purity niobium, as the preferred metal for the fabrication of superconducting accelerating cavities, should meet exact specifications. The content of interstitial impurities such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon must be below 10 μg/g. The hydrogen content {{should be kept}} below 2 μg/g to prevent degradation of the Q-value under certain cool-down conditions. The material should be free of flaws (foreign material inclusions or cracks and laminations) that can initiate a thermal breakdown. Defects may be detected by quality control methods such as eddy current scanning and identified {{by a number of}} special methods. Conventional and alternative cavity fabrication methods are reviewed. Conventionally, niobium cavities are fabricated from sheet niobium by the formation of half-cells by deep drawing, followed by <b>trim</b> <b>machining</b> and Electron-Beam Welding (EBW). The welding of half-cells is a delicate procedure, requiring intermediate cleaning steps and a careful choice of weld parameters to achieve full penetration of the joints. The equator welds are particularly critical. A challenge for a welded construction is the tight mechanical and electrical tolerances. These can be maintained by a combination of mechanical and radio-frequency measurements on halfcells and by careful tracking of weld shrinkage. The established procedure is suitable for large series production. The main aspects of quality assurance management are mentioned. Another cavity fabrication approach is slicing discs from the ingot and producing cavities by deep drawing and EBW. Accelerating gradients at the level of 35 - 45 MV. m- 1 can be achieved by applying Electropolishing (EP) treatment [...] Comment: 37 pages, contribution to the CAS-CERN Accelerator School: Superconductivity for Accelerators, Erice, Italy, 24 April - 4 May 2013, edited by R.

Stones {{are major}} {{materials}} for various {{civil engineering works}} and architectural construction areas and various kinds of stones are being used in construction sites and those areas are also very diverse. Even though the size of domestic stone market size is currently increasing, production volume cannot meet the demand because the production method is still highly dependent on manual work. In addition, as China is rising {{as the center of}} world stone market which emphasized the strong price competitiveness, imports from China are currently increasing because China is gradually securing the quality competitiveness as well. This seems because the quality of Chinese stones does not fall behind than the quality of domestic stones and in order to recover this situation, it is considered important to maximize the productivity of domestic stone working companies through the automation of production environment and to secure the price competitiveness through quality equalization to deal with low labor costs which China is emphasizing as their strength. Based on these reasons, this development was conducted and tried to secure the competitiveness of stone working by developing automatic control technology and stone working technology using air pressure and PLC, preventing risk factors and environmental problems caused by manual work in stone working site, removing working risk factors through automation and reducing dust and noise. And accordingly, automatic corner stone <b>trimming</b> working <b>machine</b> for boundary stones was developed, and production environments were improved and productivity could be maximized through the automation of manpower dependent works...|$|R

Conventional {{machining}} processes such as turning, milling, drilling, abrasive cutting, and grinding are commonly used to bring composite parts to final shape and assembly requirements. However, due to the layered nature of these materials, their machining may generate undesirable defects such as delamination and high surface roughness. The service life of composite components {{is believed to be}} highly dependent on machining quality and damage due to machining may result in scraping expensive parts. In this work, an experimental investigation was conducted to determine the effect of spindle speed, feed rate, and tool condition on machining quality of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites during edge <b>trimming</b> operation. <b>Machining</b> quality was quantified in terms of average delamination depth and surface roughness. Delaminations were also characterized by their type and frequency of occurrence. It was found that average delamination depth and surface roughness increase with an increase in feed rate and an increase in cutting distance and decrease with an increase in spindle speed. There is a strong relationship between delamination damage and effective chip thickness. The cutting conditions for best machining quality are high spindle speed and low feed rate, which correspond to small effective chip thickness. The most frequent delamination type was found to be Type I/II.

Chris Cornell....?) One act after another has fallen into the ocean. Being signed to the Universal conglomerate has been like being trapped on a cruise on the Mary Celeste. The lights are on but nobody's home.|$|R
