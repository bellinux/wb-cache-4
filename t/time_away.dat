5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010.

5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some <b>time</b> <b>away</b> from basketball.

5|$|Delegates, as {{they waited}} for the {{committees}} to complete their work, spent much of the first two days listening to various orators.

In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August. The Klondike gold rush was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of <b>time</b> <b>away</b> from the capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline {{since the fall of}} the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E
