5|$|After the Normandy {{landings}} many {{of these}} units moved north. Replacements that joined Army Group G came to refit after <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Normandy or on the Eastern Front. They were under strength, {{with little or no}} equipment.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{personnel}} {{also took}} part in the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces {{until the end of the}} war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties suffered by the Allied air forces during <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Normandy and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.|$|E

5|$|From October 1916 {{to the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> November 1918, U-15s {{activities}} are unknown. U-15 was at Pola {{at the end of the}} war when Austria-Hungary handed her over to Italy. U-15 was scrapped at Pola by 1920.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. <b>The</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number were lost in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> surrounding areas. These were replaced {{by men and women}} who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 2014, a Libyan Airlines A330 was {{severely}} damaged in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Libya and sustained {{bullet holes in}} the fuselage. On 20 July 2014, two Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 were hit by an RPG at Tripoli International Airport. One was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory at}} Bardia enabled the Allied forces to {{continue}} the advance into Libya and ultimately capture almost all of Cyrenaica. In turn this would lead to German intervention in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> North Africa, changing {{the nature of the}} war in that theatre.|$|E
5|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Papua, {{most of the}} Australian {{personnel}} {{captured by}} Japanese troops were murdered. In response, {{for the remainder of}} the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered. Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea. Meanwhile, during <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> 1942–43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice with Germany ended <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> November 1918, it {{was decided}} to have the 1918 class {{complete}} their studies. Loper therefore remained at West Point as a student officer until 11 June 1919, when he again graduated, and was assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers, as was normal for highly placed graduates. At this time, officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the Army of Occupation in Germany.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>{{fighting}}</b> <b>in</b> North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion {{participated in}} the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. It finished the war in Trieste, and remained there to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans that had entered the city. After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to Florence while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base came {{to be seen as a}} key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{escalating}} violence the government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May. Peacekeepers began to arrive in Dili the next day and eventually restored order. A total of 37 people were killed in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> April and May and 155,000 fled their homes. A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F-FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended that they be prosecuted.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the 7th Battalion served {{primarily}} in a garrison role, firstly {{being used to}} defend the Australian mainland before deploying late in the war {{to take part in}} the Bougainville campaign in 1944–45. On Bougainville, as part of the 23rd Brigade, they took part in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> the central sector of the island in the last months of the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion was once again used in the garrison role before being returned to Australia and disbanding in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the deployment, the division was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to begin training and to fill its ranks. After its basic training was complete, the division was sent to Japan in April 1951 for advanced training and {{to act as a}} reserve force for the Eighth United States Army, then fighting in Korea. The involvement of the National Guard in <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Korea was further expanded when the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard received warning orders for deployment as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the occupation, the German {{administration}} pursued a conciliatory policy toward the Belgian people in order to gain their support and co-operation. This policy was, in part, because there was little resistance activity and because the demands the Germans needed to place on Belgian civilians and businesses were relatively small on account of their military success. During <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Belgium, however, there were incidents of massacres against Belgian civilians by German forces, notably the Vinkt Massacre in which 86 civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|It was {{activated}} in mid 1918, {{too late}} to join <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> World War I. The division {{is best known for}} its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division. Fighting in the European Theater, the division advanced through France and Germany {{through the end of the}} war, fending off serious German counterattacks along the way. World War II would be the only war the division would fight in before taking on its role as a training unit.|$|E
5|$|The 34th Battalion was {{initially}} used for garrison duties on Fiji and New Caledonia before being committed to <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> the Solomon Islands, briefly seeing combat against the Japanese in the Treasury Islands in late 1943. Returned to New Zealand in mid-1944 and was disbanded {{later that year}} {{as part of a}} partial demobilisation of New Zealand forces. Many of its personnel returned to civilian employment while others were sent to Italy as reinforcements for the New Zealand 2nd Division. The battalion was awarded three battle honours for its service during the war.|$|E

The Trung sisters were executed or killed during <b>the</b> <b>fighting.</b> <b>In</b> popular accounts, they vanished in the sky, fell sick, or took {{their own lives}} by jumping into a river and drowning. Violence in the region continued, and there were seven periods of unrest between 100 and 184. A new strategy was adopted, orchestrated by the official Li Gu, that sought to appoint honest officials, exile hostile tribes, and pit tribal leaders against each other. The strategy was only partially successful.|$|E
