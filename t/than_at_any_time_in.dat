Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E

25|$|BRM's {{fortunes}} did {{not improve}} in 1967, despite closely contesting the Tasman Series with Jim Clark who probably raced closer and harder with Jackie <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their careers. While Clark usually won, Stewart won a classic victory in the New Zealand Grand Prix with Clark attempting to run him down in the last laps with bodywork flying off his Lotus. In F1 the BRMs were still struggling with reliability problems and Stewart came no higher than second at Spa, despite having to drive one-handed while holding the car in gear with the other. In F2 he won events at Karlskoga, Enna, Oulton Park, and Albi in a Tyrrell-entered Matra MS5 or MS7. He also placed 2nd driving a works-entered Ferrari driving with Chris Amon at the BOAC 6 Hours at Brands Hatch, the 10th round of World Sportscar Championship at the time.|$|E

500|$|During {{his service}} as ambassador, Hay {{attempted}} {{to advance the}} relationship between the U.S. and Britain. The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its colonial role that was refreshed by its Civil War neutrality, when British-built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of these past differences, according to Taliaferro, [...] "rapprochement made more sense <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their respective histories". In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, [...] "The great body of people in the United States and England are friends... that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries". Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.|$|E
500|$|The monastery {{was damaged}} {{as a result}} of the 2011 Van earthquake. According to Ara Sarafian, [...] "parts of the main church collapsed, while other parts were {{significantly}} weakened. Old cracks got bigger, new ones appeared." [...] Turkish engineers reportedly inspected it and announced that they would commence restoration work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian wrote that [...] "such promises have been made in the past and one needs to be a little skeptical. The current state of the church makes such work much harder <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the past." [...] He noted in a 2012 article that the local and provincial governments supported the preservation and restoration of the monastery. In October 2012, the artist Raffi Bedrosyan, who contributed to the restoration of the St. Giragos Church in Diyarbakır, stated that he had hoped to restore Varagavank and added that [...] "Both Ankara and Van agreed to launch the restoration project, but social and natural obstacles delayed the process.". In 2017 it was documented that the remaining stones of the monastery are torn down bu the authorities and local government to build a local mosque and other developments with them.|$|E

2500|$|As Walton's {{second term}} on the CFA {{came to an}} end in 1971, he was praised for his {{leadership}} of the commission.

Walton gave a freer rein to Gordon Bunshaft, who was much more aggressive and brusque during Walton's second term than the first. At the same time, Walton himself became a trusted advisor to Lady Bird Johnson, helping strengthen her city beautification efforts and giving them a political boost.|$|E

2500|$|With {{increased}} {{accessibility to}} and elaboration upon advanced analytical techniques in the 19th century, physics {{was defined as}} much, if not more, by those techniques than by the search for universal principles of motion and energy, and the fundamental nature of matter. [...] Fields such as acoustics, geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, plasma physics, low-temperature physics, and solid-state physics joined optics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and mechanics as areas of physical research. [...] In the 20th century, physics also became closely allied with such fields as electrical, aerospace and materials engineering, and physicists began to work in government and industrial laboratories {{as much as in}} academic settings. Following World WarII, the population of physicists increased dramatically, and came to be centered on the United States, while, in more recent decades, physics has become a more international pursuit <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> its previous history.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{rates of}} ocean {{acidification}} have been {{compared with the}} greenhouse event at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (about 55million years ago) when surface ocean temperatures rose by 5–6degrees Celsius. No catastrophe was seen in surface ecosystems, yet bottom-dwelling organisms in the deep ocean experienced a major extinction. The current acidification is on a path to reach levels higher than any {{seen in the last}} 65million years, and the rate of increase is about ten times the rate that preceded the Paleocene–Eocene mass extinction. The current and projected acidification has been described as an almost unprecedented geological event. A National Research Council study released in April 2010 likewise concluded that [...] "the level of acid in the oceans is increasing at an unprecedented rate". A 2012 paper in the journal Science examined the geological record in an attempt to find a historical analog for current global conditions {{as well as those of}} the future.
