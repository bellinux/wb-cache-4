The database consisting of ICE-GB and ICE-IRE is used to obtain qualitative and quantitative results {{on the use of}} light verb structures. The study explains and evaluates the steps employed to optimize parser output in detecting open lists of light verb constructions. It discusses the qualitative usage differences of these structures in the data between the two varieties and finds that ICE-GB favours fewer high frequency light verbs while ICE-IRE contains more diverse lower frequency light verbs and more passives. Overall, counts of light verb constructions are considerably higher than previously assumed. The projected counts suggest <b>that</b> <b>attestations</b> of light verb constructions will increase considerably if the search is not restricted to certain high-frequency light verbs as is typically done in studies employing manual or semi-automatic approaches to data collection...|$|R

40|$|Ricoeur defines {{attestation}} as the 2 ̆ 2 {{assurance of}} being oneself acting and suffering 2 ̆ 2 {{or as the}} 2 ̆ 2 assurance - the credence and the trust - of existing {{in the mode of}} selfhood. 2 ̆ 2 In this dissertation I discuss the concept of attestation in Ricoeur 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy in relation to the main dimensions of the self: Capacities, personal identity, memory and otherness. I state <b>that</b> <b>attestation</b> {{is the key to the}} three dialectics of Ricoeur 2 ̆ 7 s hermeneutics of the self: The dialectic between reflection and analysis, the dialectic between idem-identity and ipse-identity and the dialectic between oneself and other. In these three dialectics, attestation, as the assurance of being oneself acting and suffering, allows the self to appropriate its otherness: The otherness of its capacities, the otherness of its identity, the otherness of its body, of other people and of its conscience. In other words, the self gains the confidence of being a self through the confidence that the actions it performs and the words it says are its own actions and words; the confidence that the narratives it tells express its own identity; the confidence that the body is its own body; the confidence that the esteem of others mediates its own esteem and that the values that it embraces are its own values. This analysis is made in the first four chapters of this dissertation. In the fifth chapter I explore the relationship between attestation and recognition. Attestation is not only necessary to understand the self at a hermeneutical level, but at the same time attestation shows a main ontological trait of the self: The self is attestation in the sense that the self is the confidence of existing as a self, confidence that is gained by appropriating its otherness. Thus, the concept of attestation along with providing an understanding of the self through otherness (hermeneutical level) shows us that to become a self we need to attest to our self by appropriating our otherness (ontological level). Then, as a conclusion, we can state <b>that</b> <b>attestation</b> serves as a bridge between hermeneutics and ontology in the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur...|$|R

An open-ended framework for attestation is desirable for safe support to sensitive or highvalue activities on heterogeneous networks.

We argue <b>that</b> (i) <b>attestation</b> {{must be able to}} deliver temporally fresh evidence; (ii) comprehensive information about the target should be accessible; (iii) the target, or its owner, should be able to constrain disclosure of information about the target; (iv) attestation claims should have explicit semantics to allow decisions to depend on several claims; and (v) the underlying attestation mechanism must be trustworthy. We propose an architecture for <b>attestation</b> <b>that</b> is guided by these principles, as well as an implementation that adheres to this architecture. Virtualized platforms, which are increasingly well supported on stock hardware, provide a natural basis for our attestation architecture. ...|$|R

In addition, confidential data, such as authentication passwords, are only accessible by the electronic commerce server to which the users intend to transfer their data.

Existing attestation mechanisms are limited to attesting which applications outside the TrEE are authorized to use the credential.

Now, my Lords, in this letter there are several things worthy of your Lordships' observation. The first is, that this woman is not conscious of having ever been accused of any rebellion: the only accusation that ever came to her ears was, that Captain Gordon said that his baggage had been robbed by one of her aumils. She denies the truth of this charge; and she produces testimonials of their good behavior to him; and, what is the essential point of all, she desires Mr. Hastings to apply to this Mr. John Gordon, and to know from him what truth or falsehood there is in that accusation, and what weight there is in the attestation she produces. [...] "Mr. Gordon is now present," [...] says she; [...] "ask him yourself of these matters." [...] This reasonable request was not complied with. Mr. Gordon swears before Sir Elijah Impey to the robbery; but he never mentions the paper he had written, in which he confessed that he owed his life to this very lady. No inquiry was made into this matter. Colonel Hannay was then alive. Captain Gordon was alive, and she refers to him: yet that very man was sworn before Sir Elijah Impey, and accuses his prisoner.
