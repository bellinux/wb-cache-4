5|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{as well as}} {{application of}} process damping in milling of thin-walled workpiece made of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> is investigated. <b>Titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> used commonly in aviation industry is one typical difficult-to-machine material. Chatter usually occurs in cutting of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy,</b> which results in poor surface quality and damaged tool. Thus, chatter is one important restriction for the quality and efficiency of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> manufacture, especially for the thin-walled workpiece made of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> due to poor structural stiffness. Process damping results from interference between flank face and machined surface, which is critical but usually ignored in chatter analysis for difficult-to-machine material. The paper presents one nonlinear dynamic model considering process damping for milling of thin-walled workpiece made of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> and designs antivibration clearance angle to suppress chatter based on the model. The experimental and computational {{results indicate that the}} presented methods for chatter stability analysis are reasonable, and the antivibration clearance angle designed is effective in suppressing chatter and improving machining quality...|$|R

5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> are partially adopted in some critical areas.

Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
40|$|It {{was found}} in the 1 st report that {{sintered}} carbide K type is most suitable tool material for lathe turning of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> because of its large thermal conductivity and small affinity for <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy.</b> From this fact, sintered carbide K 10 as tool material was used in this experiment. we have tried to see how machinability of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> is effected by hot machining, using two methods, sectional electric resisting and gasoline burner heating. To compare with <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy,</b> carbon steel S 45 C on which built up edges grow easily has been machined in same cutting condition as <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy.</b> The results are as follows. (1) When <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> is machined with sintered carbide tool K 10,being heated by sectional electric resisting heating, cutting resistance is reduced. But tool life decrease because the cutting edge is softened by high cutting temperature. (2) When alternating current is used as heating current, owing to cycle of it, variation of cutting resistance and surface roughness become larger, these tendencies are particularly remarkable in <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy.</b> (3) When the gasoline burner heating is used, the work is stisfactoly heated unlike in sectional electric resisting heating, and accordingly variation of cutting resistance and surface roughness become smoller...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{evaluation}} {{has been done}} on Material Removal Rate (MRR), Surface Roughness (SR) and Electrode Wear Rate (EWR) during Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> using copper, brass and aluminum electrodes. Analyzing previous work in this field, it is found that electrode wear and material removal rate increases with an increase current. It is also found that the electrode wear ratio increases with an increase in current. The higher wear ratio is found during machining of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> using a brass electrode. An attempt has been made to correlate the thermal conductivity and melting point of electrode with the MRR and electrode wear. The MRR is found to be high while machining <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> using brass electrode. During machining of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> using copper electrodes, a comparatively smaller quantity of heat is absorbed by the work material due to low thermal conductivity.

5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The dis{{advantage of}} this criterion is that it is often irrelevant. For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance. Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't always agree with other methods. For instance <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{increasing}} popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, {{it is now}} possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys,</b> which were not available in earlier times.|$|E
25|$|Titanium frames {{typically}} use <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> and tubes {{that were}} originally {{developed for the}} aerospace industry. The most commonly used alloy on titanium bicycle frames is 3AL-2.5V (3.5% Aluminum and 2.5% Vanadium). 6AL-4V (6% Aluminum and 4% Vanadium) is also used, {{but it is more}} difficult to weld, make tubes of, and machine. Often, the tubes are of 3AL-2.5V while dropouts and other peripheral sections are made of 6AL-4V. Experimental frames have been made with commercially pure (CP, i.e.:unalloyed) titanium, but these proved less durable for the active riding intended for frames of this cost level.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> (TC 18) is {{new style}} alloy (α+β). It {{possesses}} better performances than common <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy.</b> However, <b>Titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> (TC 18) is still classified as difficult-to-machine materials for their poor machinability, which {{is attributed to}} relatively low modulus of elasticity, strong alloying tendency or chemical reactivity with cutting materials at higher temperatures and low conductivity of heat generated by the cutting action. Due to the poor machinability of the alloys, selecting of insert style is crucial for tool life and material removal rate. In this work, milling tests, using three kinds of inserts (KC 522 M, YD 201 and SANDVIK 4240), were carried out {{on this kind of}} <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> (TC 18). The results of tests show that the material removal rate of insert KC 522 M is the highest, but its tool life is shorter compared with insert SANDVIK 4240. The material removal rate and tool life of insert YD 201 do not draw the attention because both of them are relatively low. The abrasion speed of insert SANDVIK 4240 is slow and the efficiency is high, so it is ideal for machining <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> (TC 18). In addition, the optimal machining parameters of insert SANDVIK 4240 for milling <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> (TC 18) were also given in this paper...|$|R
