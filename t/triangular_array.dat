5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the <b>triangular</b> <b>array</b> displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what the Number Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E

Recently some non-random and some random but dependent driving sequences {{have been shown}} to result in consistent Markov chain sampling, sometimes with considerably improved accuracy. The key to consistent sampling is for the driving sequence to be completely uniformly distributed (CUD) or weakly CUD. This paper gives some sufficient conditions for an infinite sequence to be (W) CUD. The earlier theory did not incorporate acceptance-rejection sampling. We show by a coupling argument that a strategy due to Liao (1998) for inserting IID points into a WCUD sequence leads to consistent sampling.
