5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E
5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E

Philip II's successor, Philip III, was a man of limited ability, uninterested in politics and preferring to delegate management of the empire to others.

25|$|Lucas Strachan was a {{brilliant}} Springbok flanker and one {{of members of the}} legendary 1937 Springboks that won a series in New Zealand. He {{was the first of the}} <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> Springbok rugby players produced by the Blue Bulls. And after his playing days, he achieved fame as both coach and selector. He will also be remembered for his enthusiastic team talks and witty speeches. Northern honoured him by naming the club rugby trophy in Pretoria after him - teams compete for the Lucas Strachan Shield.|$|E
25|$|In his heyday {{he was a}} <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> bowler able to gain {{vigorous}} off-break {{from even}} the most docile wickets. Hearne was also able to vary his pace and bowl a fast ball that swerved {{at a time when}} the skill was not well known. He had a long run for the time and a classic, full-on, high action that gave him higher bounce on hard, very fast wickets than most bowlers of the 1890s. His ability to thrive on hard work was seen in the dry summer of 1896 when he bowled over 10,000 balls – a feat performed previously only by Alfred Shaw, whilst in 1898 Hearne bowled over 9000 balls in a wetter summer.|$|E

25|$|The {{simultaneous}} twin {{objectives of}} bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling {{the ball in}} such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball {{in such a way}} that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> bowler may be able to combine all three.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was back}} in time for {{what would be a}} memorable Finals series. In the Qualifying Final defeat to arch-rivals Carlton, Hart kicked five goals and was among Richmond's best players. He was again among {{the best players in the}} {{cut-throat}} Semi-final against St Kilda, but had to get his knee drained of fluid the following Monday and continued limping until the Wednesday. Desperate to have him play, the selectors put him on the bench (in this era a replacement could only be used once) for the Preliminary Final against and watched forlornly as the Tigers slipped to a six-goal deficit at half time. Coach Tom Hafey took a big risk by bringing Hart on at this point; Hart's inspirational performance in booting two goals lifted the Tigers to an amazing victory, thus underlining Hart's reputation as one of the <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> leaders in the game. In the 1973 VFL Grand Final, Hart dominated against Carlton, winning 19 possessions, seven marks and kicking three goals, even though his knee had improved only marginally since the previous week.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{recovered}} {{during the}} truce, ordering her finances and doing much to restore her prestige {{and stability in}} the run-up to the last <b>truly</b> <b>great</b> war in which she would participate as the leading power. In the Netherlands, the rule of Philip II's daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and her husband, Archduke Albert, restored stability to the southern Netherlands. But Philip III and Lerma lacked the ability to make any meaningful change in the country's foreign policy. They clung to the idea of placing the infanta Isabella on the English throne after Queen Elizabeth's death and sent a limited expeditionary force to Ireland to aid the Spanish-supplied rebels. The English defeated it, but the long war of attrition there had drained England of money, men, and morale: Elizabeth's successor, James I, wanted a fresh start to his reign. The war that had been going on between the two countries since 1585 finally ended. War with France threatened in 1610, but shortly after, Henry IV was assassinated, and the country fell into civil war again. Up until 1630, Spain was at peace and continued its dominant position in Europe. Meanwhile, Lerma's enemies expelled him from office in 1617, and Baltazar de Zúñiga began calling for a more aggressive foreign policy.|$|E

On both the recording and at the CD release concert, the legendary guitarist joined top Philadelphia Jazz talents including the aforementioned Tom Lawton and Bobby Zankel; one of the tunes, Art the Messenger (inspired by drummer Art Blakey), encapsulates Taylor's spiritual feelings regarding both his music making/ band leading approach and his overall worldview: Specifically, that positive hope combined with the musical diversity displayed in his compositions weaving together Afro-Cuban, fusion, straight ahead, blues and avant-garde can {{play a part in}} a larger message of connecting us all individually to something bigger than ourselves, a sum <b>truly</b> <b>greater</b> than its parts.
