5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. <b>The</b> <b>trucking</b> industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight—a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E

At World Finals X, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> reached <b>the</b> final round in racing against Maximum Destruction. However, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> lost its brakes during the run, causing <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> to flip violently when Blackwell attempted to steer it. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> eventually landed several rows in the stands of Sam Boyd Stadium, although no one was injured.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trucking</b> {{industry}} {{serves the}} American economy by transporting {{large quantities of}} raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. Trucks are also used in the construction industry, as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other building materials used in construction. Trucks in America {{are responsible for the}} majority of freight movement over land and are tools in the manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing industries.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly all aspects of <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> industry. Truck drivers are limited {{by the number of}} daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. <b>The</b> <b>trucking</b> industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E

5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic vehicles on display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. The displays included a 1916 Mack Paddy Wagon, a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford Tank Truck. A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages.

5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System also {{made it possible for}} <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|These labor-intensive, short-haul {{services}} were all vulnerable to competition from automobiles and buses (for {{the first two}} services) and <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> industry (for the remaining three), particularly where facilitated by four-lane highways.
