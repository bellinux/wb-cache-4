5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by {{the square of the}} absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E

25|$|When {{quantifying}} moneyness, it is computed as {{a single}} number with respect to spot (or forward) and strike, without specifying a reference option. There are thus two conventions, depending on direction: call moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot increases relative to strike, and put moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot decreases relative to strike. These can be switched by changing sign, possibly with a shift or scale factor (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> put with strike K expires ITM is one minus <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> call with strike K expires ITM, as these are complementary events). Switching spot and strike also switches these conventions, and spot and strike are often complementary in formulas for moneyness, but need not be. Which convention is used depends on the purpose. The sequel uses call moneyness – as spot increases, moneyness increases – and is {{the same direction as}} using call Delta as moneyness.|$|E
