These are combined with in cylinder gas sampling data from a single cylinder engine fitted with a fast gas sampling valve. Both measurements confirm that the in-cylinder soot oxidation slows down when the inlet concentration of O 2 is reduced. A 38 % decrease in intake O 2 concentration reduces the soot oxidation rate by 83 %, a non-linearity suggesting that O 2 in itself is not the main soot oxidizing species. Chemical kinetics simulations of OH concentrations in the oxidation zone and estimates of the OH soot oxidation rates point towards OH being the dominant oxidizer...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} the most common engine {{technology}} used in transportation. Its widespread use comes from its inherent high efficiency and its relative low cost. It suffers from pollutant emission issues, however, that need detailed understanding of their origins to meet the strictest current and upcoming emission standards. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the study of the mechanism at the origin of soot particle emissions and gives indications on which parameters can effectively reduce them. There are two competing in-cylinder processes, soot formation and soot oxidation, governing soot emissions from conventional combustion in diesel engines. To this day, it is still often believed that inhibiting the formation of soot reduces its emissions, despite several studies showing poor relationship between soot formation and emission in most conditions encountered in diesel engines. The results presented in this thesis aims at highlighting the importance of soot oxidation in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> over the soot formation process. An effort was realized to identify the parameters governing its oxidation and how it results in lower emission levels. The study of those parameters has been realised through the use of in-cylinder sampling of gases and optical measurements. The optical measurements were realised in a heavy-duty diesel engine using a Bowditch design with a specifically designed three-valve cylinder head. This cylinder head had an optical access located {{at the top of the}} combustion chamber, allowing the study of processes occurring in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle,</b> when the piston is moving down into the cylinder. The diagnostic chosen for this study is called laser extinction, a line of sight technique based on the absorption of light by the soot particles present in the flame. The data collected gave information on the evolution of the soot concentration and could be used to characterise the soot oxidation rate in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle.</b> The in-cylinder sampling measurements were realized in order to gather information on the soot particle characteristics. The results showed a strong correlation between the soot oxidation rates and the emission levels, underlining the importance of improving the oxidation rate rather than the soot formation in order to reduce soot emissions. It was shown that increasing the mixing of gases in the cylinder by means of increased turbulences could lead to a negative impact on the soot oxidation rates that were passed on to the soot levels in the exhaust. A variation of temperature of gases showed little to no impact on the soot oxidation rates and did not seem to effectively impact the emission levels. An increase of the gas density in the cylinder of gases lead to improved oxidation rate that also reduced emission levels. Of the injection related parameters studied, the injection pressure and the injector hole size had a strong impact on the soot oxidation rates even long after the end of the injection process. The most important parameter identified that affected the soot oxidation rates was the oxygen concentration. This parameter was studied in detail and it showed that a reduction of oxygen concentration lead to a slower maturation of soot during the combustion. While this feature produced more reactive soot particles prone to be more easily oxidized, it was revealed to be concerning a limited amount of particles in the cylinder. Moreover, it was largely overruled by the reduction of OH produced in the flame. Using simulation tools, it was shown that lowering the oxygen concentration reduced the flame temperature, which in turn reduced the OH concentration. The reduction of OH correlated strongly with the reduction in oxidation rates observed in the optical measurements, to a greater extent than just the drop of oxygen concentration...|$|E

One of the several methods to evaluate the long-term performance of concrete during winter is KS F 2456. Relative dynamic modulus of elasticity shows the resistance to freezing and thawing. METHODS: To measure relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, ultra sonic is generally used. But in this study, to measure the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, both ultra sonic and shear wave were used and then compared each other.

Environmental conditions exerted a significant effect on fruit set as showed by the higher natural drop rate recorded in the late production cycle with respect to the early cycle.

40|$|Soot {{emissions}} from diesel internal combustion engines are strictly regulated nowadays. Laser extinction measurement (LEM) and natural luminosity (NL) of sooty flames are commonly applied to study soot. LEM measures soot along the laser beam path {{and it can}} probe soot regardless of temperature. NL integrates the whole field of view and relies on soot temperature. In this work, a comparison of simultaneously recorded LEM and NL data has been performed in a heavy-duty optical engine. A 685 nm laser beam is used for LEM. The laser was modulated at 63 kHz, which facilitated subtraction of the background NL signal from the raw LEM data. By Beer-Lambert’s law, KL factor can be calculated and used as a metric to describe soot measurements. A compensation of transmitted laser intensity fluctuation and soot deposits on optical windows has been performed in this work.

40|$|PM in {{diesel exhaust}} {{has been given}} much {{attention}} due to its adverse effect on both climate and health. As the PM emission levels are tightened, the portion of particles originating from the lubrication oil is likely to increase. In this study, exhausts from a biodiesel-fueled Euro 5 engine were examined {{to determine how much}} of the carbonaceous particles that originated from the fuel and the lubrication oil, respectively. A combination of three methods was used to determine the PM origin: chain length analysis of the hydrocarbons, determination of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), and the concentration of 14 C found in the exhausts. It was found that the standard method for measuring hydrocarbons in PM on a filter (chain length analysis) only accounted for 63 % of the OC, meaning that it did not account for all non-soot carbon in the exhausts. Comparing the chain length method to the 14 C-based method showed that the non-extractable organic carbon originated both from the oil and fuel. Elemental carbon (EC), also known as soot, was found to originate mainly from the fuel. However, excessive amounts of oil in the engine cylinders increased the relative contribution from the oil as well as the absolute emissions of EC. This could either be due to the surplus oil forming soot, or to the soot particles being coated by oil and thereby less efficiently oxidized during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle.</b> The results demonstrate the importance of carefully regulating the amount of lubrication oil reaching the cylinder...|$|E

Currently insufficient information on the biology and epidemiology of the pathogen limits the development of efficient management options to control MPR. This research aims to elucidate MPR development through the following daily microclimatic variables: minimum and maximum temperatures, wetness frequency, average temperature and relative humidity in the highly susceptible cacao clone Pound- 7 (incidence = 86 % 2008 – 2013 average). A total of 55 cohorts totaling 2, 268 pods of 3 – 10 cm length, one to two months of age, were tagged weekly. Pods were assessed throughout their lifetime, every one or two weeks, and classified in 3 different categories: healthy, diseased with no sporulation, diseased with sporulating lesions. As a first step, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to determine with no a priori the period (when and for how long) each climatic variable was better related with the appearance of symptoms and sporulation. Then the significance of the candidate variables was tested in a complete GLMM. Daily average wetness frequency from day 14 to day 1, before tagging, and daily average maximum temperature from day 4 to day 21, after tagging, were the most explanatory variables of the symptoms appearance. The former was positively linked with the symptoms appearance when the latter exhibited a maximum at 30 °C. The most important variables influencing sporulation were daily average minimum temperature from day 35 to day 58 and daily average maximum temperature from day 37 to day 48, both after tagging. Minimum temperature was negatively linked with the sporulation while maximum temperature was positively linked. Results indicated that the fungal microclimatic requirements vary from the early to <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> stages, possibly due to the pathogen's long latent period. This information is valuable for development of new conceptual models for MPR and improvement of control methods. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{conducted}} three-dimensional numerical simulations {{to investigate the}} effect of ultra-high injection pressure on diesel ignition and flame under high-boost and medium-load conditions. Three injection cases employed in experiments with a multi-cylinder Volvo D 12 engine were applied for validation. The simulations were performed using the KIVA- 3 V code, with a Kelvin-Helmholz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) spray breakup model and a diesel surrogate mechanism involving 83 species and 445 reactions. A range of higher injection pressure levels were projected and the injection rates estimated for the current study. Three different rate shapes of injection were projected and investigated as well. All the projected injection events start at top dead center (TDC). Computations demonstrate that high-pressure injection strongly affects engine ignition and combustion. An increase in injection pressure leads to reduced ignition delay time, higher in-cylinder pressure peak, advanced combustion phasing, and faster flame propagation. The {{study found that the}} ultra-high pressure injection does not cause the flame lift-off length in the engine to increase, the trend of which seems to be contradictory to the observations obtained from the studies in high-pressure, high-temperature constant-volume vessels. While the burn durations reduced with an increase in injection pressure, the simulations of three different injection rate shapes suggest that the rate-falling injection leads to a shorter, early (10 - 30 %) burn duration angle but a longer, late (70 - 90 %) burn angle. The prediction indicates that the engine has a relatively larger flame area of higher temperature in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> for the rate-rising injection than for the rate-falling one. The existence of higher temperature in the late engine cycle may be beneficial to soot oxidation. On the other hand, the simulations show that higher injection pressure results in a faster NO production rate in the early phase of combustion but leads to a lower NO peak level. The rate-rising injection lowers NO production compared with the other two injection strategies...|$|E

40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{questions}} related to generic diesel combustion research and optically accessible engines are used to study the combustion process. Images of the combustion are analyzed together with in-cylinder pressure and exhaust gas emission measurements. The results {{can be divided into}} two main categories: one about evaluations of optically accessible engines and one about studies of emissions and heat release. The focus is on the link between the combustion event and engine-out emissions. The reason for putting efforts on the first category is to get more reliable information from the second one. First, the mechanical behaviour during operation of optical engines is discussed. Optical engines may suffer from distortion of the in-cylinder volume trace due to mechanical deformation from mass, pressure and thermal forces. This distortion causes errors in heat release calculations. A method to account for the errors is therefore developed which makes the calculations insensitive to mechanical deformations. The optical access also affects the engines heat transfer properties which can cause differences in heat release and engine-out emissions compared to all-metal engines. Fortunately, it is possible to compensate for the differences and achieve realistic engine-out emissions and combustion phasing by adjusting the charge temperature. The engine-out soot emissions are the result of a complex series of events including fuel air mixing, premixed combustion, mixing controlled combustion, and late soot oxidation. The first part of the emission section in this thesis deals with factors that are known to be important for the soot formation and estimates how they affect the engine-out soot emissions. The goal is to identify characteristics of the soot formation that are important for the engine-out smoke level and thereby the soot particle mass. Two studies are included in this chapter, one about air entrainment and one about early soot formation. It is indicated that the rate of soot-formation during the quasi-steady jet-phase has a rather weak relation to the level of engine-out soot. This is despite the usage of few, small, nozzle holes leading to a long injection duration with {{a large portion of the}} combustion taking place during the fuel injection period. The observation is explained as follows: First, a large fraction of the soot is formed in the transition between the premixed and spray-driven combustion which weighs down the importance of the quasi-steady jet-phase. Second, factors that enhance the soot formation during the jet phase in some cases also enhances the soot oxidation during this phase. Third, correlations to emissions of CO and UHC further point to the importance of the oxidation process and characteristics of the heat release indicates that this is partly related to <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle.</b> The second part of the emission section deals with the sources of CO and UHC during low temperature combustion. It is suggested that the squish volume is crucial for the engine-out CO and UHC levels during low load. Two combustion concepts with different injection strategies are investigated, one with very early start of injection (SOI) and one with SOI close to TDC. The squish volume is indicated to be the major source of not fully oxidized products in both cases which shows that the importance of this source is not easily erased...|$|E

Direct evidence indicates positive hydroclimatic phases at 135, 125, 103, 80, 47, and 12 - 10 ka, coincident with widespread continental records of high lake levels, that confirm {{the validity of the}} U/Th chronology...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{highlight}} the correlations from <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> economic <b>cycle</b> (2001 - 2014) between the metallurgical, the construction and the machinery sectors in the European Union, in general, and in Romania, in particular. Using ANCOVA models, this analysis has three major objectives: first, to show that the machinery industry and the construction sector have a general impact on the metallurgy industry, regardless of the business cycle phases; secondly, to underline that the size of this impact differs across these phases and, thirdly, to illustrate that the relations between the three sectors were quite different in Romania and in the European Union. The interpretation of the results shows that the assumptions are largely confirmed...|$|R

Precise locations of two deletions in Raji DNA have been identified and their consequences for gene structure evaluated. The deletion in Raji of reading frames BALF 1, BARF 1, and BZLF 2 and truncation of BALF 2 and BERF 5 probably account for the replication defect in this strain. The degree of sequence variation between B 95 - 8 and Raji has been examined and shows considerable variation between genes. The latent membrane protein gene is exceptionally polymorphic and the initiator methionine for <b>the</b> <b>late</b> productive <b>cycle</b> protein overlapping the latent membrane protein is absent in Raji. © 1988...|$|R
