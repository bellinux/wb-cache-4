40|$|This paper emphases and {{discusses}} counseling to interpret how <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> use judgment and reflection in dialogues with {{patients and their}} relatives. The {{purpose of the study}} was to gain more insight into the opportunity for <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> to encounter patients and their families within the hospital, and how <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> judgment are expressed when they counseling the patients and their next of kin. Data was collected using twenty papers from students undergoing the study program at master level “Honours in Health Pedagogy”, 30 ECTS, in Northern Norway. Qualitative content analysis where reducing, grouping and abstracting the text is used to achieve main themes. The practitioners’ experiences from practicing counseling and dialogue with patients and their relatives represent three following perspectives. It’s a challenge to find a room with possibility for confidentiality. <b>The</b> <b>practitioners</b> also experience not having time enough for counseling, based on dialogues. <b>The</b> <b>practitioners</b> say <b>the</b> encounter and counseling is often behind the screen or in the corridor.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on loyalty and {{conflict}} in the PR field; loyalty and conflict between <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> and <b>the</b> employer on the one hand, and between <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> and target groups on the other hand. The research among 251 practitioners in Norway confirms the "client syndrome": <b>The</b> <b>practitioners</b> are closely attached to their employer, and the ties of loyalty are stronger in private sector than in public sector. There are also differences due {{to the place of}} work {{when it comes to the}} level of conflict, and it is not unusual that <b>the</b> <b>practitioners</b> try to avoid conflict by choosing "neutrality". The research shows that the stronger the ties of loyalty are, the more likely is it that conflict will occur. Choosing sides in a conflict (with management or target groups) does not affect <b>the</b> <b>practitioners?</b> attitude to two-way symmetrical communication, and the research supports the view that the feminine worldview is a symmetrical worldview...|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world.

5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require <b>the</b> <b>practitioner</b> to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first while teaching school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers from Buffalo law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889) and Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854).|$|E
