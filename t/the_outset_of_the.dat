5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu {{wrote the}} {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), {{which made him}} well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the}} most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Frederick {{had one of}} {{the finest}} armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|This {{multiplication}} <b>of</b> effects at <b>the</b> very <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play {{served as}} a shock and foretaste <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> audience would find farther along.|$|R
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>the</b> {{education}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{children was}} given top priority, and from 1892 the boys' school, and from 1898 the girls' school were administered strictly under government regulations, and the institution received a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentary Grant from the Education Department.|$|R
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pier {{has been}} intimately {{linked with the}} central {{reclamation}} project which was unveiled in 1989 but not explicitly spelled out as such. However, <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles.|$|R
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed {{down to a}} more {{manageable}} eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers {{in the western part of}} the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voyage {{included}} 6,000 {{pieces of}} pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USC {{came in for}} widespread criticism, {{not only}} from Irish nationalists, but also from elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British military and administrative establishment in Ireland and the British press, who saw the USC as a potentially divisive and sectarian force.|$|R
50|$|Adolf {{had neither}} {{influence}} nor power, and was elected Rex Romanorum because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electors' {{preference for a}} weak king. His power was limited from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commitments he made.|$|R
40|$|During {{the long}} period between <b>the</b> Renaissance and <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> Romanticism, <b>the</b> Petrarchan example was {{a role model}} {{establishing}} the same code for recognized aesthetic and human values. In relation to <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feminine form, when a woman does not correspond to that patern mimicry becames <b>the</b> sign <b>of</b> a double articulation...|$|R
5|$|The {{national}} {{chief and}} the national vice chief are selected by a caucus of the section chiefs at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order of the Arrow's national planning meeting. At the national level, the OA is headed by the National Order of the Arrow committee of which the national chief and national vice chief are voting members.The national adult leadership includes the volunteer national chairman and the OA director, a professional Scouter.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall {{have been}} {{subjected}} to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose <b>the</b> Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment <b>of</b> Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.|$|R
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> board <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society {{consisted}} <b>of</b> a President, who {{was always}} <b>the</b> Governor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, several Vice-Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer and a committee of twelve. From 1883 both <b>the</b> Society <b>of</b> Arts and <b>the</b> Philosophical Society were affiliated by Act <b>of</b> Parliament to <b>the</b> Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery of South Australia and {{had the right to}} nominate one member each to be Gazetted to the Libraries Board.|$|R
2500|$|While ESPN/ABC {{televised}} {{the first}} seven matches, Australian syndicator Spondo distributed a pay-per-view internet feed. [...] At <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States servers were swamped and many viewers {{had to wait until}} midway through the front nine to view the stream, at which time the bandwidth was increased, and most viewers could watch.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century {{most of the}} European {{settlements}} {{were related}} to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2006 season, Sanchez {{competed for}} the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered {{the starting quarterback}} when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame {{but he did not}} attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korean War, Leyte {{was ordered}} to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds {{despite the efforts of}} wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alliance {{had raised}} {{questions as to}} whether it would lead to a merged party, or the two parties were destined to compete with each other. This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully. Such cross-party feuding was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reason for Jenkins losing his Hillhead seat to Labour candidate George Galloway in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Falconbridge Limited in mid-1981 {{commissioned}} a copper smelter and refinery near Timmins, Ontario, to treat concentrate from its Kidd Mine. However, at <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathode copper {{produced in the}} Kidd refinery suffered from <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> higher than usual concentrations of lead and selenium in the copper smelter’s anodes. Kidd cathode copper {{was not able to}} meet its customers’ specifications and obtaining product certification for the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) became a key focus.|$|R
30|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> IS, <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executives’ {{support has}} been recognized to obtain all the benefits which IT systems can offer. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first studies about the matter (Swanson 1974) showed that the managers who participate in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> IS achieve a greater appreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. This means that the participation {{has an influence on}} the appreciation. Swanson describes the “appreciation” concept as the executive’s belief about <b>the</b> relative value <b>of</b> IS in a particular business activities.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, {{due to the}} {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Australia's {{economy had}} been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed {{it was estimated that}} after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|Born in Portland, Maine, Loring {{joined the}} U.S. Army in 1942 and was quickly {{selected}} to undergo pilot training. He spent several months stationed in Puerto Rico before being transferred to {{duty in the}} United Kingdom in 1944. There, he flew 55 combat missions in P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft before being shot down and serving six months as a Nazi German prisoner of war. By <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korean War, Loring was working in an administrative role in the United States, but by 1952 had been transferred to combat duty in Korea.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could never}} analyse why, right from <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand crowds {{had taken a}} set against Greg. Perhaps it was his jaunty manner on the field. Perhaps he was a shade too successful for <b>the</b> liking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more rabidly parochial Kiwi fans...You could never understand the mentality behind the crank phone calls Greg received in New Zealand, the egg-throwing and the incident in Wellington where a toilet seat was thrown on the field.|$|R
5|$|Facing the Wehrmacht {{were three}} Soviet fronts forming a {{defensive}} line between <b>the</b> cities <b>of</b> Vyazma and Bryansk, which barred {{the way to}} Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 to 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> Typhoon <b>the</b> VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.|$|R
2500|$|A {{perennial}} {{issue in}} <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> mathematics concerns <b>the</b> relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued {{to ask the}} questions mentioned at [...] <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> this article, <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> mathematics in <b>the</b> 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in formal logic, set theory, and foundational issues.|$|R
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{but they were}} found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp jab from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily {{starting in the}} sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At {{the end of the}} eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled {{the richest man in}} the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E
50|$|During {{proceedings}} Mary's attorney {{encouraged her}} to continue {{when she wanted to}} quit. He needed her permission to re-examine her husband's character (jealousy). Upon cross, Mark's personality was brought into cler view; establishing that he didn't like Mary being civil, accepting a light from a friend, singing in a nightclub or offers of hospitality when there was no other alternative. It was established that Mark was jealous from <b>the</b> very <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage and that the divorce proceedings were motivated purely and simply by his unreasonable and uncontrollable jealousy.|$|R
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Council on 11 March 1990, Lithuania {{adopted the}} Reconstruction Act and the Provisional Basic Law. On March 12, the Supreme Council adopted Resolution, that {{declared}} USSR universal military service law of 12 October 1967, invalid within <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Lithuania. <b>The</b> Council also nationalized all <b>the</b> assets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USSR, that {{were located in}} Lithuania. But just three days later, on 15 March, <b>the</b> Soviet Congress <b>of</b> People's Deputies adopted a resolution, in which restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Lithuania was declared null and void. Congress passed this resolution with 1,463 people's deputies voted for, 98 voted against and 128 abstentions.|$|R
