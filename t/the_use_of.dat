40|$|Purpose (mandatory) The {{present study}} {{develops}} a conceptual model that examines {{the underlying mechanisms}} {{of the link between}} <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation and brand image strategy, from the corporate communication perspective. The study incorporates three kinds <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation: value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication. Design/methodology/approach (mandatory) Using a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with top executives in the pharmaceutical industry in Taiwan to investigate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation on brand image strategy from the managerial perspective. Findings (mandatory) Findings provide richness into forming the basis for developing a framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> reputation, with implications for managers and academics alike. The qualitative findings generally showed that three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation (i. e. value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication) are applicable to managers’ brand image strategy implementation. For the Taiwanese pharmaceutical industry, the research highlights that value creation herein pertains to the value created for the firm, as (a) cost/sacrifice value, (b) symbolic/expressive value, and (c) experience/hedonic value. Originality/value (mandatory) Reputation {{is one of the most}} important concerns for pharmaceutical firms, as it develops and builds trust with key stakeholders. However, in the pharmaceutical industry context, <b>the</b> application and <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation is little researched. A need exists for research that examines <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation at the firm level. This study fills this important gap in developing a conceptual framework for <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, most studies on <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> corporate reputation in pharmaceuticals are in the contexts of Western countries, thus, limiting the generalisablility. Taiwan is the context for the present study...|$|R
