5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E
5|$|One of Speer's first {{commissions}} after Troost's {{death was}} the Zeppelinfeld stadium—the Nürnberg parade grounds seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece Triumph of the Will. This huge work {{was able to}} hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft searchlights. Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E

25|$|Another {{fundamental}} {{symmetry of}} nature is CPT symmetry.

40|$|Summary. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to dene item cumulative score ratio curves and item cumulative completion ratio curves and to propose a new method to estimate fair extension ratios <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> for students with disabilities from these curves. The proposed method estimates extension ratios <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>tests</b> under the time-limit method from experimentally collected test data utilizing the work-limit method. In this experiment we found that for students with visual disabilities, the present extension ratio <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> at the National Center Test for University Admissions in Japan is fair in Mathematics and English and that in order to improve the present <b>testing</b> method <b>of</b> the National Center Test, further extension <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> is necessary for some subjects with a large amount of reading questions, such as Japanese...|$|R
