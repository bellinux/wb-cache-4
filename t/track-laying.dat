5|$|In August 2009, TIE began legal {{proceedings}} against the BSC consortium over delays to the project, and <b>track-laying</b> on Leith Walk, Shandwick Place and Haymarket was suspended. At issue were alleged changes to BSC's work specification, including track works on Princes Street and £5 million additional costs for foundation work near Murrayfield Stadium. The BSC consortium alleged that TIE had not diverted the underground utilities {{in time for}} <b>track-laying</b> to begin, breaching contractual agreements and costing the consortium additional staffing expenditure.|$|E
5|$|After {{the draft}} {{business}} case {{was accepted by}} the Scottish Government in March 2007, initial construction work commenced in July 2007, with the diversion of underground utilities in preparation for <b>track-laying</b> in Leith. These works followed a plan by System Design Services (SDS), a joint design team led by Parsons Brinckerhoff and Halcrow Group.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{the project}} met with delays {{to work on}} tramway infrastructure. Phase 1b {{of the project was}} {{cancelled}} because of a funding shortfall in April 2009. Contractual disputes delayed <b>track-laying</b> in the city centre. In December 2009, media reported that the project budget was running over £545 million, and the system was unlikely to come into operation until February 2012 or later. The operating contract with Transdev was cancelled in December 2009 to reduce costs and it was announced that the trams would be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh. In March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the estimated completion date would be in 2014.|$|E
25|$|During 1871, {{construction}} had {{progressed to}} the point where the road bed throughout the three divisions was practically completed including work in Frederick city itself in Biser's field north end of Love Lane or East Street. <b>Track-laying</b> of the iron rail purchased from Lochiel had been carried from the State line to Little Pipe Creek eleven miles.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>track-laying</b> crews, other crews were busy setting up stations with provisions for loading fuel, water and often also mail, passengers and freight. Personnel had to be hired to run these stations. Maintenance depots had to be built to keep all of the equipment repaired and operational. Telegraph operators had to be hired to man each station {{to keep track of}} where the trains were so that trains could run in each direction on the available single track without interference or accidents. Sidings had to be built to allow trains to pass. Provision had to be made to store and continually pay for coal or wood needed to run the steam locomotives. Water towers had to be built for refilling the water tanks on the engines, and provision made to keep them full.|$|E
25|$|Vogt and Due's {{concession}} {{was transferred}} to a company, A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab, which was incorporated on 26 August 1874. The share capital was set to 200,000 speciedaler. The company bought a lot on Pilestredet 10,000 speciedaler, which became the site of Homansbyen Depot, including the company's administration. In its original design it had places for 44 vehicles and 116 horses, {{as well as a}} smithy, offices, apartments, a laboratory for the veterinary and a sick bay for twelve horses. The company was permitted to use tracks on top of the roads, although the municipality retained the right at any time to require them to be dug down. The company opted for standard gauge, presumably because this was most common amongst horsecars and eased procurement. <b>Track-laying</b> started in May 1875. Because of the location of the depot and the low traffic estimates along Drammensveien, KSS opted to instead build a branch to Homansbyen.|$|E
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual <b>track-laying</b> gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, Major Ernest Swinton, sent to France as an army war correspondent, {{very soon}} saw the {{potential}} of a <b>track-laying</b> tractor. [...] He proposed to Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, that the British build a power-driven, bullet-proof, tracked vehicle that could destroy enemy machine-guns. Holt tractors were [...] "the inspiration {{for the development of}} the British tank." ...|$|E
500|$|The steam {{tractors}} {{were extremely}} heavy, sometimes weighing [...] per horsepower, and often {{sank into the}} rich, soft earth of the San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland surrounding Stockton, California. Holt tried {{to solve the problem}} by increasing the size and width of the wheels, but this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain. One tractor had wheels [...] tall and [...] wide, producing a tractor [...] wide. Holt could spend hours in his private workshop, and experimented by adding multiple wheels and ultimately with a <b>track-laying</b> technique.|$|E
500|$|Holt {{returned}} to Stockton and applied his skills and his company's expertise in metallurgy, design, and testing {{to develop a}} workable <b>track-laying</b> system. He replaced the wheels on a [...] Holt steamer, No. 77, {{with a set of}} wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island. Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it!" [...] Others reported that Holt got the name from British troops who witnessed a working prototype of Hornsby's track-type vehicle in July 1907. Continuous tracks allowed practical cultivation of the rich farmland on an industrial scale. The invention also allowed planters to reclaim thousands of acres of delta land previously unusable for farming.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Track-laying</b> in Tibet was {{launched}} from both directions, towards Tanggula Mountain and Lhasa, from Amdo Railway Station on 22 June 2004. On 24 August 2005, track was laid at the railway's highest point, the Tanggula Pass, [...] above sea level.|$|E
2500|$|Since 18 July 2014, it {{has been}} {{relocated}} to Suffolk Street, {{in front of the}} Tourist Information Office, in order to make way for Luas <b>track-laying</b> work to be completed at the old location. Due to the increase in tourist foot traffic, and a common penchant for being [...] "handsy", the statue has been groped often enough that the bronze hue has begun to wear off on the bosom.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Holt {{settled in}} Stockton in 1883 {{and with his}} three {{brothers}} founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the Holt Manufacturing Company. On Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable <b>track-laying</b> machine, plowing soggy San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland. Company photographer Charles Clements {{was reported to have}} observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, loans totalling US$3 billion were {{secured from}} the Exim Bank of China, with US$2.4 billion going to the Ethiopian section of the railway and the balance to be spent in Djibouti. Additional funding was {{secured from the}} China Development Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. 20,000 Ethiopians and 5,000 Djiboutians were hired for {{construction}} work. <b>Track-laying</b> was completed on the Mieso–Djibouti segment of the project in June 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contract}} for the permanent way, including ballast, track and the overhead wires was issued to Infranord and was worth NOK163.9 million. The {{contract for}} the signaling, telecommunications and power supply was issued to Eltel and was worth NOK146.2 million. The latter included lighting, ventilation and other technical components in the tunnels. Both contracts were for the entire [...] section. Infranord used a SVM 1000 <b>track-laying</b> train in November 2014 to lay the permanent way. The [...] long train was able to lay about [...] of ballast, ties and track each day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{process of}} {{flash butt welding}} involves an automated <b>track-laying</b> machine running a strong electrical current through the touching ends of two unjoined pieces of rail. The ends become white hot due to electrical resistance and are then pressed together forming a strong weld. Thermite welding is used to repair or splice together existing CWR segments. [...] This is a manual process requiring a reaction crucible and form to contain the molten iron. Thermite-bonded joints are seen as less reliable and more prone to fracture or break.|$|E
2500|$|Survey {{teams were}} put out to produce {{detailed}} contour {{maps of the}} options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the [...] "best" [...] route. Survey teams {{under the direction of}} the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular <b>track-laying</b> crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a <b>track-laying</b> record by laying [...] of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the pride}} of caste!" [...] said Ida. [...] "Doesn't that count? Doesn't success even at such things as <b>track-laying</b> or {{chopping}} trees depend on moral {{as well as physical}} strength?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was a man}} {{who acted}} on impulse and, as a rule, the more unusual a course was the better it pleased him. In spite of her {{lameness}} Miss Foster was attractive, which, perhaps, had its effect, though he was mainly actuated by compassion and the monotony of his <b>track-laying</b> task. He did not think the settlement, in which there were very few women, was the kind of place in which she could comfortably remain, particularly if her means were exhausted. Presently he met the livery-stable keeper driving in his buggy and motioned to him to pull up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carlton's prairie, we call it," [...] said Bransome, {{leaning against}} his light wagon, which stood, near the deserted dwelling. [...] "Land which isn't all rock or forest is mighty scarce, and Carlton figured he'd done great things {{when he bought}} this place. Five years he tried to drain it, working night and day, and pouring good money into it, and five times the freshets washed out his crops for him. The creek just laughed at his ditches. Then when he'd no more money {{he went out to}} help <b>track-laying,</b> and a big tree {{flattened}} him. The boys said he didn't seem very sorry. This prairie had broken his heart for him, and I've heard the Siwash say he still comes back and digs at nights when the moon is full." ...|$|E
60|$|The first spadeful of sand of the Desert Railway {{was turned}} {{on the first day}} of 1897; but until May, when the line to Kerma was finished, no great efforts were made, and only forty miles of track had been laid. In the {{meanwhile}} the men of the new Railway Battalion were being trained; the plant was steadily accumulating; engines, rolling stock, and material of all sorts had arrived from England. From the growing workshops at Wady Halfa the continual clatter and clang of hammers and the black smoke of manufacture rose to the African sky. The malodorous incense of civilisation was offered to the startled gods of Egypt. All this was preparation; nor was it until the 8th of May that <b>track-laying</b> into the desert was begun in earnest. The whole of the construction gangs and railroad staff were brought from Kerma to Wady Halfa, and the daring pioneers of modern war started on their long march through the wilderness, dragging their railway behind them--safe and sure road which infantry, cavalry, guns, and gunboats might follow with speed and convenience.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the line}} as far as Kosheh was completed, the advance towards Dongola began. After the army had been victorious at Hafir the whole {{province}} was cleared of Dervishes, and the Egyptian forces pushed on to Merawi. Here they were dependent on river transport. But the Nile was falling rapidly, and the army were soon {{in danger of being}} stranded by the interruption of river traffic between the Third Cataract and Kenna. The extension of the line from Kosheh to Kerma was therefore of vital importance. The survey was at once undertaken, and a suitable route was chosen through the newly acquired and unmapped territory. Of the ninety-five miles of extended track, fifty-six were through the desert, and the constructors here gained the experience which was afterwards of value on the great Desert Railway from Wady Halfa to the Atbara. Battalions of troops were distributed along the line and ordered to begin to make the embankments. <b>Track-laying</b> commenced south of Kosheh on the 9th of October, and the whole work was carried forward with feverish energy. As it progressed, and before it was completed, the reach of the river from the Third Cataract to Kenna ceased to be navigable. The army were now dependent for their existence on the partly finished railway, from the head of which supplies were conveyed by an elaborate system of camel transport. Every week the line grew, Railhead moved forward, and the strain upon the pack animals diminished. But the problem of feeding the field army without interfering with the railway construction was one of extraordinary intricacy and difficulty. The carrying capacity of the line was strictly limited. The worn-out engines frequently broke down. On many occasions only three were in working order, and the other five undergoing 'heavy repairs' which might secure them another short span of usefulness. Three times the construction had to be suspended to allow the army to be revictualled. Every difficulty was, however, overcome. By the beginning of May the line to Kenna was finished, and the whole of the Railway Battalion, its subalterns and its director, turned their attention to a greater enterprise.|$|E
