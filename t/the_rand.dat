5|$|On 8 May 2014, the South African Rand grew 1.2% {{against the}} US dollar, {{reaching}} {{its highest level}} in four months. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>Rand</b> was still trading strongly as preliminary {{results showed that the}} ANC would defeat the EFF, whose left-wing policies worried investors.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2009, in {{an effort}} to {{counteract}} runaway inflation, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other, more stable currencies to do business, alongside the Zimbabwe dollar. In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009. In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as <b>the</b> <b>rand</b> (South Africa), the pula (Botswana), the euro, and the Pound Sterling (UK).|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} <b>the</b> <b>RAND</b> Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
50|$|Despite being a {{separate}} municipal area, like <b>the</b> East <b>Rand,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Rand</b> {{is included in}} the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area.

50|$|In the 2010s, <b>the</b> Ayn <b>Rand</b> Institute has {{increasingly}} focused on spreading Objectivism globally.

50|$|The {{report of}} the De Kock Commission on Exchange Controls tabled in November 1978, {{proposed}} a gradual easing of exchange controls. This saw the replacement of <b>the</b> Blocked <b>Rand</b> by <b>the</b> Financial <b>Rand</b> in early 1979. In line with this policy, <b>the</b> Financial <b>Rand</b> itself was abolished in 1983 and non-residents could repatriate {{the majority of their}} South African investments via <b>the</b> Commercial <b>Rand.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses <b>the</b> <b>Rand</b> and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|Development of Myst {{began in}} 1991. The game's {{creative}} team consisted of <b>the</b> <b>Rand</b> and Robyn, {{with help from}} sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and Ryan Miller, who together made up Cyan, Inc. Myst {{was not only the}} largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop. Cyan took inspiration from games like Zork, Star Wars mythic universe, portals to other worlds like in C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia, and the mysterious islands of old literature like the works of Jules Verne. The game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book The Mysterious Island by Verne.|$|E
5|$|Serong was {{appointed}} to command the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) in 1962. He was later seconded to the Americans and was senior advisor to the South Vietnamese Police Field Force between 1965 and 1968. Leaving the Army in 1968, he remained in Vietnam as a security and intelligence adviser to the South Vietnamese government, as well as working for <b>the</b> <b>Rand</b> organisation, Hudson Institute and other corporations, and consulting to the Pentagon and several US presidents. He continued to serve in Vietnam until the fall of Saigon in 1975. He was considered a world authority on counter-insurgency warfare and wrote widely on the subject. In later life he maintained an interest in Australian defence issues and was at times a controversial figure due to his support for several citizens' militia groups, conspiracy theories and right-wing political causes. He died in 2002.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one bag was intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed to Room 404 of <b>the</b> <b>Rand</b> McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg, removing the cigar box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E
