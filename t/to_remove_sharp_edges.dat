50|$|Two {{principal}} {{techniques are}} used to produce seed beads: the wound method and the drawn method. The wound method is the more-traditional technique, is more time consuming, {{and is no longer}} used in modern bead production: in this technique, a chunk of glass known in glassmaking as a gather and composed mainly of silicon is heated on an iron bar until molten. A second bar of iron is then inserted into the gather and the two bars quickly drawn apart creating a long glass rod (the final width of which would depend on how quickly and how far the bars are separated before the glass solidifies). This rod is then cut into shorter rods for handling. Next, one of these is re-heated and wound around a hot metal wire creating a ring of glass which is then worked and shaped until smooth and round. This is done several times on the same wire creating a series of glass rings. Once the wire cools, the rings are slipped off and then used as beads. For the drawn method, an air bubble is created within the gather and as the iron bars are drawn apart they produce a long tube rather than a rod. This tube is then cooled, cut into rings, and the rings are tumbled <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> before being used as beads.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSelective Laser Deburring (SLD) is an {{innovative}} edge-refinement process being {{developed at the}} Laser Zentrum Nord (LZN) in Hamburg. It offers a wear-free processing of defined radii and bevels at the edges {{as well as the}} possibility to deburr several materials with the same laser source. Sheet metal parts of various applications need to be post-processed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and burrs remaining from the initial production process. Thus, SLD will provide an extended degree of automation {{for the next generation of}} manufacturing facilities. This paper investigates the dependence between the deburring result and the temperature field in- and post-process. In order to achieve this, the surface temperature near to the deburred edge is monitored with IR-thermography. Different strategies are discussed for the approach using the IR-information as a quality assurance. Additional experiments are performed to rate the accuracy of the quality prediction method in different deburring applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} {{description}} of special purpose unit made from a cylindrical grinding attachment of lathe machine to perform chamfering and deburring operation on workpieces of various sizes. Chamfering and deburring operations are necessary for many industrial products {{in order to keep}} the edges from being damaged and also <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> The other advantages of chamfering and deburring are high quality finish of the product, safer material handling, increased personal safety. Conventional methods used for these operations consume major machine setting time and also requires skill. Manufacturers are turning to special purpose units to achieve consistent results and to reduce other machine engagement times and to lower costs. Considering all the aspects, a special portable unit is made from existing grinding attachment. Chamfer of acceptable quality having required depth can be achieved. Angle can be set as 45 ° ± 15 °. The advantage of this unit in terms of reduction in process time and less skill while maintaining quality of chamfer is justified by practical trial observations...|$|E

40|$|Blanking of {{sheet metal}} is an {{important}} forming process in the automotive industry for the manufacture of mechanical components. The final component shape, obtained {{at the end of}} bending or deep-drawing processes, often has <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> due to the blanking operation. Concerning passenger safety components, like seat belt anchors, rounding of the edges by punching is necessary to avoid cutting the belt material. In addition <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> the punching results in work hardening of the material in the rounded zones which results in an increase in the local resistance of the material. In this study, a high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA S 500 MC) has been tested with the aim of quantifying the blanking and edge rounding operations. The mechanical behaviour of test specimens is investigated by means of tensile tests and the material is characterised in terms of Vickers micro-hardness. Numerical simulations of the edge rounding process are developed using previously identified material behaviour laws. The residual stress fields are characterised and compared to experimental results. This is done so that numerical simulation can be done in the future to prediction the in-service behaviour of the component. Specimens with rounded edges are compared to specimens that were not submitted to the rounding operation. It is shown that Edge Rounding by Punching improves the component resistance, therefore justifying the use of this process in the manufacture of automotive safety components...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGlass shaping, which {{corresponds}} to {{the removal of the}} edges of a specimen, is the last finishing operation in glass manufacturing. This process has several functions on the final shaped glass including <b>removing</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> improving mechanical resistance, decreasing surface damage and giving it an aesthetical aspect. This article addresses the effects of working parameters, including grinding forces and consumed power, on surface edge finishing and damage mechanism induced during glass grinding. Microscopic observations and multi-scale analysis have also been conducted to investigate the surface edge characteristics. Experimental results show three damage regimes. The first (regime I) is a partial ductile regime with cutting action accompanied by chip formation. The second (regime II) is a crushing (or fragmentation) regime. The last (regime III) is also a partial ductile regime but by ploughing action with displaced material. The shaped surface obtained in the regime II has a better roughness than that obtained in regime I and III. However, regimes I and III include streaks and form defects which are not present in regime II. Similar to metallic materials, the evolution of force components show a linear relationship between normal and tangential forces. This implicates a constant average contact pressure and friction coefficient (l) between the flat grains and the workpiece...|$|R

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{employed}} to help reduce both mechanical and acoustic vibrations within the system. Mechanical vibrations are mainly attributed to traffic {{in and out of}} a building Other sources of mechanical vibrations have often been seen in the higher stories of a building due to reduced damping from building supports. This source of vibrational noise is easily controlled through the use of a vibration isolation table. Acoustical vibrations are far more common than mechanical vibrations. This type of vibration is a result of air movement near the instrument such as fans or human voices. Several {{methods have been}} developed to help reduce this source of vibration. An easy solution for this is separating the electronic components from the stage. The reason for this separation of components is due to the cooling fans within the electrical devices. While operating, the fans lead to a constant source of vibrational noise within the system. In most cases, other methods still need to be employed to help reduce this source of noise. For instance, the instrument can be placed within a sealed box constructed of acoustic dampening material. Smaller stages also result in less surface area for acoustic vibrations to collide with, thus reducing the noise recorded. A more in depth solution consists of <b>removing</b> all <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> on the instrument. These <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> can excite resonances within the piezo-electric materials which increase the acoustic noise within the system.|$|R

50|$|Many horses require {{floating}} (or rasping) {{of teeth}} once every 12 months, although this, too, is variable and {{dependent on the}} individual horse. The first {{four or five years}} of a horse's life are when the most growth-related changes occur and hence frequent checkups may prevent problems from developing. Equine teeth get harder as the horse gets older and may not have rapid changes during the prime adult years of life, but as horses become aged, particularly from the late teens on, additional changes in incisor angle and other molar growth patterns often necessitate frequent care. Once a horse is in its late 20s or early 30s, molar loss becomes a concern. Floating involves a veterinarian wearing down the surface of the teeth, usually <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>sharp</b> points or <b>to</b> balance out the mouth. However, the veterinarian must be careful not to take off too much of the surface, or there will not be enough roughened area on the tooth to allow it to properly tear apart food. Additionally, too much work on a tooth can cause thermal damage (which could lead to having to extract the tooth), or expose the sensitive interior of the tooth (pulp). A person without a veterinary degree who performs this service is called a horse floater or equine dental technician.|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{homemade}} balloon dilator and protector hood composed of condoms for assisting the removal of sharp foreign bodies lodged in the upper esophagus in difficult cases is reported. A conventional endoscopic method failed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> two <b>sharp</b> bones and two press-through packages became impacted in the upper esophagus. A condom was {{used to make a}} balloon dilator that was attached to a flexible endoscope in an attempt to dilate the upper esophageal sphincter to dislodge the impacted sharp bones. This handmade condom balloon dilator succeeded in dislodging the two tightly impacted sharp bones and assisted in removing the impacted objects in the upper esophagus.
