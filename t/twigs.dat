5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognji≈°te {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak <b>twigs,</b> some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak <b>twigs,</b> with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak <b>twigs</b> is bound together with <b>twigs</b> of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E

5000|$|The next morning, <b>Twig</b> is awoken by a Slaughterer {{who tells}} him that he has outstayed his welcome, and is {{expected}} to leave immediately. Outraged and disappointed, <b>Twig</b> leaves, with the Slaughterer telling him to [...] "watch out for the Gloamglozer" [...] in a mocking tone. <b>Twig</b> has a run-in with a Skullpelt which attempts to kill him, but <b>Twig</b> is saved by a Caterbird which has just hatched from his cocoon. As all Caterbirds share telepathic dreams whilst in the womb, this Caterbird knows all about <b>Twig</b> and his destiny. The Caterbird tells <b>Twig</b> his destiny lies [...] "beyond the Deepwoods" [...] and flies off, telling <b>Twig</b> he will always protect him. That night, <b>Twig</b> is almost eaten by a Bloodoak, but falls into a Gyle-Goblin colony, where he is almost caught by their colony mother, an obese Grossmother. Then <b>Twig</b> meets an injured Banderbear, one of the forest's dominant predators. The Banderbear is sick because of a rotten tooth, which <b>Twig</b> heals by wrenching it out. Soon, <b>Twig</b> and the Banderbear become great friends, but one day the Banderbear is killed by a swarm of Wig-Wigs, ferocious predators which act like piranhas. Later, <b>Twig</b> almost drowns in a swamp, but is rescued by a goblin at the edge, who mysteriously vanishes just as <b>Twig</b> is about to thank him. <b>Twig</b> then follows a young girl, and he discovers she is a Termagant Trog who has not yet matured. <b>Twig</b> spends a few months with the Trog girl, who grows to become fond of him as a [...] "pet" [...] and eventually the girl's maturing ceremony takes place. <b>Twig</b> watches as the girl he has come to love grows enormously gigantic by drinking Bloodoak sap. Now fully formed as a Trog female, the girl attempts to kill <b>Twig,</b> as she sees all other species as vermin. However, a lone Trog male saves <b>Twig,</b> much to his surprise, and directs him to the exit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Finding all {{occurrences of}} a <b>twig</b> pattern in an XML {{document}} is a core operation for XML query processing. The emergence of XML {{as a common}} mark-up language for data interchange has spawned great interest in techniques for filtering and content-based routing of XML data. In this paper, we aim to use the state-of-art holistic <b>twig</b> join technique to address multiple <b>twig</b> queries {{in a large scale}} XML database. We propose a new <b>twig</b> query technique which is specially tailored to match documents with large numbers of <b>twig</b> pattern queries. We introduce the super-twig to represent multiple <b>twig</b> queries. Based on the super-twig, we design a holistic <b>twig</b> join algorithm, called MTwigStack, to find all matches for multiple <b>twig</b> queries by scanning an XML document only once. ...|$|R

5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using <b>twigs</b> and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and <b>twigs.</b> Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E

The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear <b>twigs</b> snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>twig</b> {{is a small}} thin {{terminal}} branch of a woody plant.

40|$|An XML <b>twig</b> query, {{represented}} as a labeled tree, is essentially a complex selection predicate on both structure and content of an XML document. <b>Twig</b> query matching {{has been identified as}} a core operation in querying treestructured XML data. A number of algorithms have been proposed recently to process a <b>twig</b> query holistically. Those algorithms, however, only deal with <b>twig</b> queries without OR-predicates. A straightforward approach that first decomposes a <b>twig</b> query with OR-predicates into multiple <b>twig</b> queries without OR-predicates and then combines their results is obviously not optimal in most cases. In this paper, we study novel holistic-processing algorithms for <b>twig</b> queries with OR-predicates without decomposition. In particular, we present a merge-based algorithm for sorted XML data and an index-based algorithm for indexed XML data. We show that holistic processing is much more efficient than the decomposition approach. Furthermore, we show that using indexes can significantly improve the performance for matching <b>twig</b> queries with OR-predicates, especially when the queries have large inputs but relatively small outputs...|$|R
5|$|Mycena lanuginosa {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, in Honshu, Japan. Fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and <b>twigs</b> in lowland forests {{dominated}} by the oak species Quercus myrsinifolia and Q.serrata. Fruiting occurs from March to November.|$|E

50|$|Soon, <b>Twig</b> meets some sky pirates, whose {{ship has}} crashed {{due to the}} flight-rock which powers the ship {{falling out of the}} sky when it was struck by lightning. <b>Twig</b> finds out that the sky pirate captain, Quintinius Verginix, is his true father, and learns at long last who he, <b>Twig,</b> really is. To <b>Twig's</b> horror, though, the next morning he awakes in a deserted forest clearing. The sky pirates have jumped ship and {{abandoned}} him... again. Momentarily distraught, <b>Twig</b> sees the pirate's fire float upwards and catch onto a tree, which sets half the forest alight. <b>Twig</b> runs for it, right down to the Edgelands, where he meets the Gloamglozer face to face. In a cruel twist, the Gloamglozer reveals that the entire set of misadventures was a cruel game devised by himself. He tells <b>Twig</b> that he, the Gloamglozer, was all the various creatures which had saved him throughout the journey. The Slaughterer who had mocked <b>Twig</b> was the Gloamglozer in disguise, as was the Trog male, and the goblin {{at the edge of the}} Mire was also the Gloamglozer in goblin form. The demon tells <b>Twig</b> that he only wanted to lure <b>Twig</b> to him so he could throw him over the Edge. The Gloamglozer does just this, although the Caterbird rescues <b>Twig</b> from oblivion and throws him onto the deck of Quintinius Verginix's ship. Finally reunited with his true father, who apologizes for leaving him and promises to always protect his son, <b>Twig,</b> the sky pirates set sail for Undertown, the central city of the Edge.|$|R

5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the <b>twigs</b> of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and <b>twigs,</b> bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant.
