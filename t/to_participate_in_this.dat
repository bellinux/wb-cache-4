In some congregations, {{it is not unusual for}} a choir <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> first night's service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other nights are more sparsely attended and those services are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.|$|E

25|$|Escaped slaves formed Maroon {{communities}} {{which played}} an important role in the histories of other countries such as Suriname, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Jamaica. In Brazil the Maroon villages were called quilombos and the most famous was Quilombo dos Palmares. Here escaped slaves, army deserters, mulattos, and indigenous flocked <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> underground society. Quilombos reflected the people’s will and soon the governing and social bodies of Palamares mirrored Central African political models. From 1605 to 1694 Palmares grew and attracted thousands from across Brazil. Though Palmares was eventually defeated and its inhabitants dispersed among the country, the formative period allowed for continuation of African traditions and helped create a distinct African culture in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} of the fortress, with its casemates, batteries, barracks, and so on, took 16 years, from 1867 to 1883, and cost 1,5 million francs. The process was somewhat chaotic: often {{parts of the}} fortress were simply blown up, the usable materials carried off by local residents, and the rest was covered up with earth. Social concerns were not absent from the enterprise. The old barracks served as lodgings for the workers employed in the demolition work. No qualification was required <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> work: during times of economic downturn, additional demolition projects on the fortress gave work to the unemployed. The dismantling became a grandiose spectacle, and a celebration of new technologies and ambitious projects. Some buildings, however, were preserved for future generations (see below).|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{news reports}} and related blogs {{indicate}} that HBOT {{is used for}} many cases of children with autism. HBOT can cost up to $150 per hour with individuals using anywhere from 40 to 120 hours {{as a part of}} their integrated treatment programs. In addition, purchasing (at $8,495–27,995) and renting ($1,395 per month) of the HBOT chambers is another option some families use. When considering the financial and time investments required in order <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> treatment and the inconsistency of the present findings, HBOT seems to be a riskier and thus, often less favorable alternative treatment for autism. Further studies are needed in order for practitioners and families to make more conclusive and valid decisions concerning HBOT treatments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the arrival of potential investors and market liquidity in a search-based model of asset trading. The entry of investors into a specific market causes two contradictory effects. First, it reduces trading costs, which then attracts new investors (the thick market externality effect). But second, as investors concentrate {{on one side of the}} market, the market becomes "congested," decreasing the returns <b>to</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> market and discouraging new investors from entering (what we call the congestion effect). The equilibrium level of market liquidity depends on which of the two effects dominates. When congestion is the leading effect, some interesting results arise. In particular, we find that diminishing trading costs in our market can impair liquidity and reduce welfare. Liquidity (Economics); Investments; Rate of return; Markov processes...|$|R
