5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage.

5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|The {{third season}} sparked controversy, namely Mel B's {{attitude}} towards the other judges, labeling them dishonest and boring. Controversy also occurred between Sebastian and contestant Mitchell Callaway; Sebastian <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Callaway's attitude to the competition following his performance on the third live performance show. There were also claims of a clash between Callaway and contestant Declan Sykes. The grand final decider was watched by 1.99 million people, making it the highest rated television episode of the season.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E

5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|With {{only the}} two years {{remaining}} in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed {{and sent to the}} Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.|$|E

Instead, Butler accused Coppell of giving aid to the Confederate cause.|$|E
25|$|Despite his prosperity, Svarocis {{was unhappy}} {{in his life}} and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a boar, but a deer came through the {{clearing}} and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that she was really the goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer and she turned into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu.|$|E
25|$|When {{the commanders}} had fled the scene, Scottish mercenaries {{overwhelmed}} the German artillery, seized {{the guns and}} <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the German cavalry. The German cavalry charged, hit by Scottish artillery fire on their way, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and 1,500 dead Scots. The German and Swedish infantry stood by without taking action, neither did the Scottish cavalry intervene. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record {{of them is that}} they were subsequently brought to Moscow.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, {{while he}} was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese {{soldiers}} who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.|$|E
25|$|The first {{clash between}} the Danish Army and the invading forces {{occurred}} at Lundtoftbjerg, where a Danish anti-tank platoon armed with two 20mm guns {{and a light}} machine gun had taken up positions covering the road. A German column appeared at 04:50, and the 20mm cannons opened fire on the armoured cars while the machine gun <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the motorcyclists. A fire started in a nearby barn, filling the air with smoke and hindering the German's advance. Eventually the anti-tank platoon was forced to withdraw to Aabenraa. About 1.5km to the north, a bicycle platoon had prepared a defence of a railway bridge. Fire from the armoured cars and strafing fighter aircraft forced the Danes to retreat, {{and a third of}} the men were captured. The Germans lost two armoured cars and three motorcycles, while the Danes suffered one dead and one wounded.|$|E
25|$|On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was {{tracked down}} by a posse outside of Parachute, Colorado. Curry and two others had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train outside Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbour. The next morning, when they {{discovered}} their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbour set out {{in pursuit of the}} gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner's and his neighbour's horses from under them; Gardner found cover while his neighbour started running. Kid Curry <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the neighbour and Gardner shot Curry. The wounded Curry decided to end it at that time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped. The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today. Rumors persist that Curry was not killed in Parachute and was misidentified, having actually departed for South America with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Charlie Siringo resigned from the Pinkertons, believing they got the wrong man.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

500|$|A {{student in}} an {{adjacent}} classroom, Sanna Orpana, {{said that her}} class had heard [...] "shooting {{and a kind of}} a rumble like tables falling down." [...] Orpana believed {{at the time that the}} noise may have been coming from a toy gun, and two other students went to investigate the noise. Saari shot at them, and the remaining students in Orpana's classroom hid under a table before running upstairs. At some point between 10:45–11:00 Saari ran down a corridor and threw a petrol bomb into a language laboratory. He then shot out all of the windows in the school's main corridor, that extended through the building. It was during this time that he also <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Forsberg.|$|E
