60|$|SIBYL. Yes; and we {{all want}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a great many other things besides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Spoon, old man, when {{leaving you}} last evening I forgot <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> those {{excellent}} cigars. Where {{did you get}} them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Always, even if I come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the work. I don't want {{anything}} to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you're of a rigour--! But be at peace. Harold's quite square," [...] he went on, [...] "and I quite meant <b>to</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{one must}} have done so," [...] said Angela. [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Lancey, <b>about</b> {{advertising}} for my little Lena's people; the Bishop said I ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, I forgot <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> details <b>about</b> one thing. When that {{extraordinary}} staring {{episode of}} Mr. Caswall went on, how did Lilla take it--how did she bear herself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my husband's case," [...] Mrs. Trevennack began, trembling. And {{the great}} specialist, all attention, {{leaned forward and}} listened to her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's unfortunate,' {{said the}} dwarf, 'for I came, in fact, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> him. A thought has {{occurred}} to me, Dick; your friend over the way--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> Harney. Isn't {{there some}} place around here {{where we might}} hide the prisoners? A cave, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't believe I {{should ever}} see you again," [...] the girl broke out impulsively upon Verrian. [...] "Oh, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> so <b>about</b> Miss Shirley. Have you seen her since you got back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poppa," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} that Mr. Breckon wants to speak <b>to</b> you--to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> He has <b>asked</b> me, but I {{want you to see}} him, for I think he had better tell you himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> again <b>about</b> {{something}} <b>you</b> {{said the}} other day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] Brooks said, {{dropping}} his voice a little. [...] "There are {{one or two}} more things which I should like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{forget that}} I spoke {{my heart to}} you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No? You {{are busy}} as ever? I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Lee. I {{was sorry to}} hear that there was a rumour that {{something}} was amiss with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it was not}} Fashoda that I {{was going}} to talk to <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> England. I know really nothing about it, for I was born in Alexandria, shortly after my parents came out from England.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have eaten}} {{some of your}} cooking, La Fleur," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "and I {{liked it so much}} that I wished <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> it. For one thing, {{where did you get that}} recipe for that delicious ice, flavored with raspberry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now come}} into the committee-room and {{have a cup of}} coffee; I know you must be faint with all this talking," [...] she concluded. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> yourself." [...] She was not older than Bartley, but she addressed him with the freedom we use in encouraging younger people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{keep you}} long from 'The Bloody Thumb' {{or any other}} catastrophic affairs," [...] said Father Brown, smiling. [...] "I only came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the crime you {{committed}} this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly, Perkins, {{considering}} I am due at ten o'clock, {{and therefore}} have only {{five minutes to}} stay. I just dropped in <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> something on which you can perhaps advise us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sound asleep, Songbird." [...] Sam {{paused for}} a moment. [...] "Come in," [...] and his chum did so, and Sam closed the door again. [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Stanley and Spud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} come here, madam, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{questions}} about your son," [...] I answered. [...] "I have come, if you will excuse me, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question <b>about</b> yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; it {{also seems}} to me enough. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another word <b>about</b> poor Mr. Touchett," [...] Madame Merle added. [...] "Have you {{reason to believe that}} he's really at his last?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me one thing. I've often {{wanted to}} know, {{and now you}} speak of it I'll venture <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> Did <b>you</b> care <b>about</b> me when <b>you</b> read Keats to me last summer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us talk of {{something}} more interesting,' he said. 'I have a question <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> yourself. Am I right in believing that the sooner you get away from Venice the happier you will be?' ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I've {{thought of}} nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate {{watching}} pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the stage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is very interesting,' said Merton. 'Now, I won't {{pretend that}} I {{disguised}} myself {{in this way}} merely <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Australian curiosities. The truth is that, in your father's interests, I must have an interview with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I merely strolled {{in on my}} {{way home}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}} <b>about</b> something that has excited my curiosity," [...] said the Mayor, with careless geniality. [...] "But I see you have not finished supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, Amy, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> {{the four}} years he speaks of. Do you think, as he says, my habits might be more fixed, and {{altogether}} you might have more confidence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear,' said he, 'I'll confess {{the whole}} scheme {{to you as}} I had laid it; I purposed here <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> your estate, as you see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had entered into some account with me of the particulars, I would have made an excuse to you to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time, and to have gone first towards London.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{question}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your plans for to-morrow," [...] she said. [...] "My eyes are very weak this evening, and I hope you will not object to dispense with the candles for a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready," [...] the girl said; [...] "but I {{wish you would}} have stopped, {{there are so many}} things I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> and these Yankee papers, which are all we see now, are full of lies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the man we rescued in the woods, Ruth," [...] he said. [...] "Probably {{you know}} him. His name is Stevenson, {{although}} {{he said he}} was usually called Uncle Barney by all who knew him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That's {{the kind}} of a canter,' says I. 'Shake the New York dust off your hoofs and be a real {{agreeable}} kind of a centaur. You broke the ice, you know, and we're getting better acquainted every minute. Seems <b>to</b> me I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your family?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{understand}} what I mean, Fred. Of course I {{do not wish}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> anything <b>about</b> your general acquaintances. No doubt you meet many girls whom you admire, and I should be very foolish were I to make inquiries of you or of anybody else concerning them. I am {{the last person to}} be so injudicious. If you will tell me that there is not and never shall be any question of marriage between you and Miss O'Hara, I will not say another word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{here is my}} book. I {{have done}} great things in my district, and should do more but for prejudice. There, this globule is the very thing for your case; I made it out last night in my book. That is right, and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> some {{questions}} <b>about</b> little Wilfred." ...|$|R
