5|$|The {{battle was}} a success for the Poles at both the <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> (the battle of Radzymin itself) and the {{strategic}} level (its role {{in the battle of}} Warsaw). After several days of constant fighting for the town of Radzymin and its immediate vicinity, the Russian attack was repelled and the Poles were able to mount a successful counteroffensive, forcing the Russian armies out of Poland and in the end destroying them completely.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On a <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> {{the battle}} went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Isle de France, although {{prompted by the}} defeat at Grand Port, had been the ultimate intention of Rowley's squadron since its creation in 1809 and had been planned carefully both on a strategic level by Bertie at Cape Town and Lord Minto at Madras and on a <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> by Rowley and his British Army counterpart Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Keating on Rodriguez. The transport ships and soldiers would come from the Indian garrisons at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta, to be led by General John Abercromby (although they were also accompanied by Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury, whom Bertie ordered to return to Madras before the invasion) while the naval forces to protect and support the invasion force were to be provided by Bertie from the Cape of Good Hope. These forces were to gather at Rodriguez {{in preparation for the}} invasion. The landings themselves were planned by Rowley and Keating, who relied on Willoughby's intimate knowledge of the coastline of Isle de France and a series of careful surveys of the reefs that surrounded the island to select a landing site.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets, Israel attacked {{the town of}} Karameh, Jordan, {{the site of a}} major PLO camp. The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians, which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev, killing two children. However, plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus attack. When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was led to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation. Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces. This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces. The Israelis were repelled {{at the end of a}} day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners. Both sides declared victory. On a <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> the battle went in Israel's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved. However, the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis. Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit. Some have alleged that Arafat himself was on the battlefield, but the details of his involvement are unclear. However, his allies–as well as Israeli intelligence–confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{strategic}} level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing the world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability {{is an element}} of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> is where strategic/political interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> generally derive from the fungibility or interchangeability of force elements and units. [...] "Technological interoperability" [...] reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility or incompatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> in terms of enhancing fungibility and flexibility.|$|R

25|$|Swarming is not {{a panacea}} for {{conflict}} at all levels. If {{there is a significant}} military force preventing the system administrator from working on developing connections, {{the other part of the}} paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established core group such as NATO, ASEAN, or the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{in exile in}} London was determined that the Home Army would cooperate with the advancing Red Army on a <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> as Polish civil authorities from the Underground State took power in Allied-controlled Polish territory, to ensure that Poland remained an independent country after the war. However, the failure of Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising laid the country open {{to the establishment of}} communist rule and Soviet domination. The Soviets performed arrests, executions and deportations of the Home Army and Underground State members, although AK partisans were generally encouraged to join the communist-led Polish armies.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposing}} theory holds that, {{in response}} to extremist ideology and unjust governments, an invasion can change the government and reeducate the people, making prolonged resistance unlikely and averting future violence. This theory acknowledges that these changes may take time—generations, in some cases—but holds that immediate benefits may still be won by reducing membership in, and choking the supply lines of, these covert cells. Proponents of the invasion strategy in such conflicts maintain the belief that a strong occupying force can still succeed in its goals on a <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> building upon numerous small victories, similar to a war of attrition.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} Slaughter at Halbe, Tony Le Tissier accused General Busse {{of failing to}} {{exercise}} effective command {{and control of the}} encircled army, thereby contributing to the failure of successive break-out attempts. Le Tissier writes that Busse's initial movement of his HQ put him into a situation where he lost the ability to control the formations in the pocket, and in his break-out plan, Ninth Army HQ was to be placed immediately behind the spearhead of the breakout, the 502nd SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which effectively reduced his ability to exercise command to the <b>tactical</b> <b>level.</b> He also accuses Busse of failing to adequately support the first breakout attempt (see below). The spearhead for the Ninth Army break-out plan on April 28 was to be the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion with remaining elements of the Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark. These units were split into two wedges. The northern wedge included the 502nd SS Panzer, Ninth Army HQ, XI SS Panzer Corps HQ, and Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark HQ. Remnants of the 21st Panzer Division were to cover in a north-westerly direction, while remnants of the 32nd SS Division 30. Januar was to cover the east and provide the rearguard.|$|E

U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Arthur Goldberg, said [...] "We believe that the military counteractions such as those which have just taken place, on a scale out of proportion to the acts of violence that preceded it, are greatly to be deplored." [...] US Ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, said that in twenty years time, a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the destruction of Israel.
