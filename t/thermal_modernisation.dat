40|$|AbstractThe study {{analyses}} {{the possibilities}} of improving timber-framed wall thermal insulation in historical buildings. Due to the specific nature of these building objects, whose historical value {{during the course of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>modernisation</b> measures cannot be affected, methods of increasing thermal insulation which require little intervention in the structure of partitions and which can be accepted by the appropriate authorities of monument protection were only indicated. The analysis was conducted using an example of a historical building from the area of Lower Silesia, for which several possible solutions of wall thermal insulation with the use of modern materials that are highly-effective in terms of thermal insulation, were proposed, and the results of carried out thermal calculations were then summarized and interpreted...|$|E
