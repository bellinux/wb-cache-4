However, these welfare gains do not come automatically but have to be earned by appropriate adjustments in domestic policies. This is particularly relevant for Germany's New Laender, which could benefit from the proximity to the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe but which also suffer particularly from inefficient institutions in Germany. Welfare gains will only be realised if wage adjustment is flexible. Instead, the German welfare system implicitly creates downward rigid wages. Without appropriate social policy reforms, the competitive pressure and the mobility of capital will destroy jobs in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Laender.</b> The paper shows the potential benefits and risks of economic integration in a simple partial equilibrium setting with flexible and rigid labour markets, respectively.

Due to the common border the Czech Republic represents an attractive target country for both vertical and horizontal direct investments. On the one hand, the still existing wage gap offers the opportunity to offshore activities abroad by reason of cost advantages. On the other hand, the increasing purchasing power of Czech customers provides favorable chances to acquire a <b>new</b> market. On <b>the</b> basis of a register of firms made available by the German-Czech Chamber of Industry and Commerce we present findings on the growing economic integration between the two countries.

The distance to the common border plays an important role for the decision to enter the Czech market.

40|$|Taking German {{unification}} as {{a natural}} experiment, the paper analyzes gender-specific labor-market participation at the regional level. Starting from theoretical considerations, we first present some descriptive evidence on the relationship be-tween active labor market behavior, the regional unemployment rate and the wage level. Using a spatial econometric approach we then investigate the determinants of participation in a comprehensive model where differences between the old and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laender</b> are considered explicitly. We generally find that regional participa-tion rates are a concave function of population density. With respect to economic conditions, the picture is mixed. A statistically significant influence of the wage level is obtained for male workers in the West only. Unemployment depresses la-bor market participation of male workers in both {{parts of the country}} and female workers in the West. By contrast, the participation rates of female workers in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laender</b> –exceeding the corresponding average figures for West German re-gions by more than 10 percentage points – appear to be insensitive to regional eco-nomic variables.

40|$|Driven by {{increasing}} environmental awareness {{as well as}} numerous environmental policy measures, the market for environmental goods has expanded {{over the last few}} years, bringing a growing number of jobs. A study of leading German economics research institutes shows that the employment effects of environmental protection have attained considerable dimensions, with nearly a million jobs in 1994 alone, with the service sector being the main beneficiary.

In <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Laender</b> important impulses towards creating and safeguarding jobs have emerged from environmental clean-up and development. The concern of this publication is not to promise a job-creation miracle by means of environmental protection alone. Nor is it a matter of legitimising environmental protection in terms of employment policy, for environmental protection does not require employment policy for legitimisation. Rather, the paper wants to provide up-to-date background information to point out the synergies between environmental and employment objectives. It also presents fields of activity which can be helpful to address both environmental and employment policy problems. I do hope that this study can provide some incentives for further action.

40|$|The paper empirically {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on individual municipalities of replacing the German local business tax by a local surcharge on income and corporation tax. The microsimulation models used for this and refined for the present paper originate in calculations carried out for the Federal Ministry of Finance in cooperation between the Federal Statistical Office and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The data basis is formed by the roughly 30 million individual data sets of the most up-to-date income and local business tax statistics provided by the Federal Statistical Office. A local surcharge tax which, like the BDI/VCI model analysed, assigns tax revenue incurred on profits to the municipality of permanent establishment and that on other income to the domicile municipality, affects the revenue situtation of the municipalities in highly differing ways. The losers in such a local tax reform include those municipalities in which an above-average number of industrial and commercial enterprises are resident. These are the "core towns" of the Old Federal Laender in particular. By contrast, the revenue situtation of the surrounding municipalities and of the municipalities with a rural character would considerably improve on average. However, the core towns in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Federal <b>Laender</b> which are currently tax-weak because they have little industry would also improve their revenue situation in most cases by applying a sucharge tax. In {{order to maintain the}} financial status quo, the core towns in the Old Federal Laender in particular would have to levy relatively high local tax rates, whilst the surrounding municipalities would be able to become more attractive by applying tax rates which as a rule would be much lower. The consequence of this would be that high-income earners in the core towns would have a not inconsiderable incentive to change their place to residence for tax purposes, which would further worsen the financial situation of the core towns.

40|$|When {{reinforcing}} {{measures are}} being decided upon, {{it is important}} to know the remaining service life of the existing road structure, in particular in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Federal <b>Laender.</b> Previously, <b>the</b> existing bearing capacity was estimated from settlement measurements made with the Benkelman beam and/or curvature measurements made with the curvature meter, and the reinforcement required was determined on the basis of this knowledge. This manner of proceeding is possible for thin asphalt layers, but not for thick ones, the remaining bearing capacity of which should also be taken into account when the reinforcement is being designed. At three investigation sections having different asphalt packet thicknesses, bearing capacity measurements were made by static and dynamic measuring methods, and drill cores were extracted. With an iterative methods and a regression method, the layer moduli of the two-layer system comprising the asphalt packet and the unbound part of the carriageway pavement were calculated from the deformation troughs measured. With the aid of the modified equivalence principle, the bearing capacity was calculated from the layer moduli. Orders of magnitude for the warning and threshold values of the bearing capacity were derived in a design calculation which used the mechanical characteristic values of the materials determined from the drill cores. It can be deduced from the bearing capacity measurements, account being taken of the results of force-controlled pulsation tests under bending stress, that with the aid of the bearing capacity alone, the remaining service life (that is to say, in the sense of failure mechanics, the time between the start of the failure phase and the state of failure) cannot be estimated, and thus it is not possible to decide on an economically favourable time for reinforcement with the aid of the temporal development of the bearing capacity (bearing behaviour). If the remaining service life is to be determined form bearing capacity measurements, a 'design calculation' must be performed, account being taken of dynamic strength tests and hypotheses. The research report contains the basic principles of a 'design calculation' for carriageway pavements on the basis of dynamic loading. (orig.)

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} East Germany has a {{significant}} lower endowment with human capital compared to West Germany when actual professional activities are taken into account.

This again is one reason for migration flows to West Germany, leading to a still worsening human capital endowment in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Laender.</b> It can be shown that lower human capital intensity is one reason for the still existing human capital gap between East and West Germany.

Because productivity can be regarded as a key for wages, for competitiveness of firms and for future transfer payments, the reasons for low productivity in East Germany are of major importance. In this article, it is argued that the existing productivity gap reflects mainly structural differences between East and West Germany, that is the high share of small firms and the predominance of sectors with low value added per worker. Additionally, difficulties on product markets leading to insufficient selling prices are responsible for the comparative low productivity of East German firms. Differences in capital intensity or in human capital, however, do explain only a small part of the productivity gap. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} {{reconstruction of}} the West German economy after World War IIand its spectacular rise to the leading position in Europe since then is undis-puted. However, the persistently high unemployment rate {{of the past two}} decades and the stagnation in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Laender</b> since unification have tarnished the splendor. Among the reasons for both the early success and the later mediocrity, a most influential one lies in Germany’s economic constitution. From this relationship a more general lesson may be drawn. A country’s economic constitution reflects an unwritten social contract. In constructing a constitution, the framers may strive for a balance between the interests of the members of society. Yet such a balance may turn out to be infeasible in the actual oper-ation of the economy. In the United States, the Founding Fathers of the U. S. Constitu-tion noted this problem in their debates, and it influenced the choices they made (Hamil-ton, Madison, and Jay [1788] 1947). The experience with Germany’s postwar economic constitution, manifested in its social market economy, differs. Still heavily influenced by their experience of the Great Depression and its mass unemployment and hardship, which had paved the way for the Nazis ’ rise to power, the framers of Germany’s eco-nomic constitution considered a social ethos a moral imperative.

They are also in advantage of childcare possibilities contrary to women in the Old Laender. There are only few offers for childcare for {{children under the age of}} 3 and above 6. In between there are area-wide kindergartens, but less than 25 % offer full time care. So it is almost impossible for mothers to work at full time jobs.

They are also often not willing to stay at home if the husbands income is adequate for the familys needs. Breeding and education of children is more often part of both parents in Eastern than in Western Germany, where women are more the only responsible parent. In contrast, family income and standard of living are still higher in the Old Federal States.

40|$|Human {{settlement}} and travel patterns are closely interrelated. Given that both have major implications for natural resources (land, soil, energy) and substantial environmental impacts (emissions, noise, threat of accidents, barriers in urban environments), they are factors of major {{significance for the}} sustainability of towns and regions. The continuing expansion of human settlements is attributable not only to growing space demands arising from almost all forms of urban land use. The use of private motor vehicles in particular consumes immense areas of land and fuels urban sprawl. Increasingly disperse settlement patterns, or the suburbanization of the environs of cities, further expand travel demand and dependence on private cars. The result is a self-perpetuating, spiralling growth of settlements and traffic volumes. In <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Laender,</b> this process is concentrated in an unusually short time frame, with all the attendant repercussions such as loss of open landscapes, higher energy consumption and continuing emissions. It is clear, if only for the reasons stated above, that the problem cannot be solved merely by improving traffic management and by switching to greener modes of transport alone, but that the traffic volume needs to be reduced by appropriate regional planning. The universally accepted formula for a traffic policy which is environmentally sound and relieves urban stress is therefore: avoid traffic, shift traffic flows, reduce the impacts of traffic on the environment.

40|$|As far as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Laender</b> of the Federal Republic of Germany are concerned, the Halle-Leipzig {{region is}} marked by an {{especially}} great development dynamics {{on the one hand}} but on the other, this old industrialized economic region suffers from serious structural problems. From these general conditions arise high demands on instruments of regional planning and management. When looking for regional political solutions administrative delimitations and beginnings of intercommunal cooperation are important factors of influence. Due to a strong increase in the establishment of shopping centres in particular in the urban regions of the two core cities of Halle and Leipzig there is a great need for action. A large number of failings caused by insufficient coordination amongst private investment activities and public planning are to be noted here. Among others, problems arise from the approval {{of a large number of}} trading estates and large-scale retail projects without considering the actual surface required and the consequences to be expected for hierarchy of urban centres. Already now it is obvious that for a long time both the lack of regional development concepts in the phase of strongest industrial location and the questionable reorganisation of the Laender and districts with its negative effects will have an influence on the development perspectives of the region. Thus, the drawing-up of the new border between Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt right through the agglomeration of Halle-Leipzig created an extremely unfavourable starting point for planning activities. In order not to spoil the region's prospects by further mistakes in regional development it is urgently necessary that the state and regional development plans come into effect as soon as possible and that political and economic decision-makers come together to work out solutions for the whole region. However, the administrative bodies necessary for an understanding of the participants and for the establishment of a regional network have still to be created. In Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt a division of labour between authorities of regional planning and town-hinterland associations to be established still is urgently necessary. As far Karin Wiest The Halle-Leipzig Region - Administrative organisation and beginnings of cooperation Europa Regional, 1 (1993) 2, pp. 1 - 11 as the cooperation of the two Laender is concerned, optimal concepts of action for the agglomeration of Halle-Leipzig are impeded by differing legal bases of planning and formalities. In this context, the possibility of establishing regional districts is being discussed in order to make political structures more efficient and to be closer to the problems. A union of the towns and districts to form a common planning region of Halle-Leipzig in the sense of a regional district, however, would involve another administrative reform which in the medium term is not possible to realise and is, therefore, no realistic alternative for the near future. In order to ensure a positive development of the region in the long run regional functions of cooperation an management bound to solid institutions cannot be renounced with. However, the scope of these institutions should not be limited to discussions and exchange of information but include concepts of action suited to realise all-regional interests...|$|E
40|$|Die hier vorgestellte Untersuchung des Vermoegens privater Haushalte als ein moeglicher Indikator fuer den Wohlstand einer Gesellschaft hat fuer die Bundesrepublik Deutschland einen starken Anstieg der Vermoegen seit 1970 aufgezeigt. Dies gilt sowohl fuer die makrooekonomischen Resultate der Finanzierungsrechnung der Deutschen Bundesbank als auch fuer die mikrooekonomischen Ergebnisse der Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichproben des Statistischen Bundesamts. Allerdings werden auch wesentliche Unterschiede im Aussagegehalt der einzelnen Datensaetze deutlich. Waehrend die Finanzierungsrechnung eine Steigerung des Nettovermoegens um 808 Prozent in 27 Jahren aufweist (von 1, 3 Billionen DM im Jahr 1970 auf 12, 1 Billionen DM im Jahr 1997) lautet der entsprechende Prozentwert auf der Berechnungsbasis der Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichproben nur 280 Prozent in 25 Jahren bei einer wesentlich niedrigeren Gesamthoehe in spaeteren Untersuchungen (von 2, 2 Billionen DM im Jahr 1973 auf nur 8, 3 Billionen DM im Jahr 1998). Die Untersuchung der Daten der EVS hat aufgezeigt, welch grosse Bedeutung das Immobilienvermoegen fuer die Vermoegenssituation der privaten Haushalte hat. Allerdings ist es nicht so, dass alle Haushalte ueber Eigentum an Grund- und Hausbesitz verfuegen. In Westdeutschland hat es zwar eine starke Steigerungen der Eigentuemerquote seit 1961 gegeben. Seit 1993 ist jedoch eine Stagnation bei etwa 50 Prozent zu konstatieren. Die Analyse der Vermoegensverteilung nur bezogen auf die westdeutschen Haushalte hat im Zeitraum von 1973 bis 1993 eine abnehmende Konzentration sowohl bei der Betrachtung der Anteile einzelner Haushaltsquintile am Nettogesamtvermoegen als auch bei der Analyse des Gini-Koeffizienten ergeben. Allerdings hat sich dieser Trend in den Jahren bis 1998 nicht weiter fortgefuehrt. Fuer das Jahr 1998 ist in Westdeutschland feststellbar, dass die unteren 40 Prozent der Haushalte ueber praktisch kein Vermoegen verfuegen, waehrend das oberste Quintil ueber 60 Prozent des Gesamtvermoegens aufweisen kann. Fuer Ostdeutschland sind starke Anpassungstendenzen hin zu den Werten der westdeutschen Bundeslaender festzustellen. Dies betrifft einerseits die {{absolute}} Hoehe der Vermoegenswerte, auch wenn diese bisher nur 38 Prozent des entsprechenden Wertes westdeutscher Haushalte bei einer Betrachtung der Durchschnittswerte je Haushalte im Jahr 1998 erreichen. Andererseits ist auch die Eigentuemerquote an Haus- und Grundbesitz nach der Wiedervereinigung stark angestiegen. Durch dieses Immobilieneigentum auf breiterer Basis wird die Ungleichheit der Vermoegensverteilung in Ostdeutschland im Zeitablauf etwas verringert, so dass der Gini-Koeffizient in den Jahren von 1993 zu 1998 leicht gesunken ist. Jedoch kann auch fuer die neuen Bundeslaender festgestellt werden, dass die unteren 40 Prozent der Haushalte ueber praktisch kein Vermoegen verfuegen, waehrend das oberste Quintil ostdeutscher Haushalte sogar ueber 70 Prozent des Gesamtvermoegens aufweisen kann. Feststellbar ist weiterhin eine hohe Uebereinstimmung der Vermoegensverteilung in Ost- und Westdeutschland. Sowohl die Vermoegensverteilung auf der Basis der Quintilswerte als auch die Resultate der Gini-Koeffizienten weisen aehnliche Ergebnisse auf, wobei eine starke Angleichungstendenz zwischen beiden Landesteilen gegeben ist. Diese Aehnlichkeit der Ergebnisse kann nur als erstaunlich bezeichnet werden, wenn man bedenkt, dass beide Landesteile fuer ueber 40 Jahre unterschiedlichen wirtschaftspolitischen Leitbildern gefolgt sind - die Bundesrepublik Deutschland der sozialen Marktwirtschaft und die Deutsche Demokratische Republik der sozialistischen Planwirtschaft. ' (Textauszug) 'This {{investigation of}} the wealth of private households as a possible indicator for the prosperity of a society indicated a strong increase in wealth for the Federal Republic of Germany since 1970. This applies both to the macro-economic results of the financial accounting of the Deutsche Bundesbank and to the micro-economic results of the Income and Consumption Surveys of the Federal Statistical Office. However, substantial differences become clear in the content expressed by these two different sets of data. While the financial accounting of the Deutsche Bundesbank shows an increase of net assets of around 808 per cent over 27 years (from 1. 3 trillion DM in the year 1970 to 12. 1 trillion DM in 1997), calculations {{on the basis of}} the Income and Consumption Surveys yield a corresponding value of only 280 per cent in a 25 -year period, with a substantially lower overall magnitude in later investigations (from 2. 2 trillion DM in 1973 to only 8. 3 trillion DM in 1998). Investigation of the EVS data pointed out the great importance of property for the wealth situation of private households. However, not every household has property in the form of housing and real estate. In West Germany, ownership rates have increased substantially since 1962. However, since 1993 these rates have stagnated at about 50 per cent. The analysis of the distribution of wealth for West German households yielded a decline in the concentration of wealth in the period from 1973 to 1993, both in terms of the shares of total wealth held by individual quintiles of households, and as expressed by the Gini coefficients. However, this trend did not continue in the years between 1993 and 1998. For the year 1998 it can be determined that the lowest 40 per cent of households in West Germany had practically no wealth, while the highest quintile claimed over 60 per cent of total assets. For East Germany, strong tendencies are established toward adapting to the values in the West German Laender. This concerns first the absolute level of net assets, even though in 1998 these amounted to just 38 per cent of the analogous value in West German households, in terms of the average value per household. Similarly, the ownership rates of housing and real estate also rose dramatically after reunification. The inequality of the distribution of wealth in East Germany was reduced somewhat by this broader basis of real-estate ownership over the course of time, such that the Gini coefficient decreased slightly in the period from 1993 to 1998. However, it is also true for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Laender</b> in the Federal Republic that the lowest 40 per cent of households have practically no wealth, while the highest quintile of East German households claim over 70 per cent of total assets, even higher than its share in West Germany. Furthermore, the distribution of wealth is remarkably congruous in East and West Germany. Both the distribution of wealth as expressed by the quintile values and the results of the Gini coefficients yield similar results, whereby the trend in both regions is toward convergence. The similarity of these results must be regarded as nothing less than amazing, considering that the two regions followed different economic models for over forty years: the social free-market economy (Soziale Marktwirtschaft) in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the socialist planned economy (Sozialistische Planwirtschaft) in the German Democratic Republic.
