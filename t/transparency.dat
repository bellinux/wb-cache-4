40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The major {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{guidelines}} for making and using <b>transparencies</b> for the improvement of teaching home economics on the secondary level. Another is to show how to use <b>transparencies</b> creatively in teaching. This study will try to help fill a gap in the knowledge of the development of <b>transparencies</b> in home economics. Preliminary information for this study was obtained through letters sent to companies which commercially prepare <b>transparencies,</b> a review of information in the field, and a questionnaire. It was found that there were very few companies interested in the development of <b>transparencies</b> in home economics. The questionnaire was sent to 100 selected Oregon home economics teachers. This questionnaire was returned by 82 of the teachers, but only 76 responses were returned in time to be included in this study. Opinions concerning areas of home economics in which <b>transparencies</b> are needed, choices of lesson planning material to accompany <b>transparencies</b> and preferences concerning <b>transparencies</b> (subject area depth, form of <b>transparencies</b> and sources of <b>transparencies)</b> were asked in the questionnaire. The concepts of values, goals and standards; careers in home economics; building relationships; decision-making; discipline of children; emotional development; safety in child play areas; physical development; babysitting; consumer education and work simplification were selected most frequently as topics from which <b>transparencies</b> should be made. The teachers selected (in order of preference) suggested learning experiences, suggestions for use, suggestions for use in class discussion, teacher read scripts and student read scripts as the type of lesson planning material that they would like to see accompany the <b>transparencies.</b> In the section of the questionnaire concerning the preferences of the <b>transparencies,</b> the results were as follows. Forty-eight of the teachers said that they would prefer a more concentrated study of fewer subjects while 23 stated that they would prefer single concept <b>transparencies,</b> covering many subjects. Fifty-two teachers responded in favor of <b>transparencies</b> which could be made in the audio-visual department of their school, while 21 stated that they would prefer those that were commercially made. The teachers overwhelmingly replied that they wished <b>transparencies</b> to be made from a combination of many resources. There were only two teachers who suggested that the <b>transparencies</b> be keyed to one published book. The results of the preliminary information were used in the development of two sets of <b>transparencies</b> [...] one in the area of child development and the other in the area of family life. Each of the sets was developed using a different basic form for the teaching materials. This was done to show the versatility of this audio-visual material as well as to make the <b>transparencies</b> more meaningful and useful in the classroom. The set on the topic of children's play was accompanied by learning experiences while the set on building relationships was written in script form. The <b>transparencies</b> were designed so that they could be easily teacher made. In the second part of this study guidelines have been developed for the use, selection and development of <b>transparencies</b> in home economics education. These guidelines have been established in order to give teachers a basis for using, selecting and developing <b>transparencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The visual {{cryptography}} is {{a secret}} sharing scheme where a secret image is encoded into <b>transparencies,</b> and the stacking of any out of <b>transparencies</b> reveals the secret image.

40|$|An image {{difference}} {{detection system}} is described, {{of the type}} wherein two created image representations such as <b>transparencies</b> representing the images to be compared lie coplanar, while light passes through the two <b>transparencies</b> and is formed into coincident images at the image plane for comparison. The two <b>transparencies</b> are formed by portions of a polarization rotation spacial light modulator display such as a multi-pixel liquid crystal display or a magneto optical rotation type. In a system where light passing through the two <b>transparencies</b> is polarized in transverse directions to enable {{the use of a}} Wollaston prism to bring the images into coincidence, a liquid crystal display can be used which is devoid of polarizing sheets that would interfere with transverse polarizing of the light passing through the two <b>transparencies...</b>|$|R

Stacking two <b>transparencies</b> after reversing one of <b>transparencies,</b> another secret image will unveil.

40|$|Abstract — Visual {{cryptography}} {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} used to encrypt the images by dividing the original image into <b>transparencies.</b> The <b>transparencies</b> can be sent to the intended person, and at the other end the <b>transparencies</b> received person can decrypt the <b>transparencies</b> using the tool, thus gets the original image. The proposed Visual cryptography provides the demonstration to the users to show how encryption and decryption can be done to the images. In this technology, the end user identifies an image, which is not the correct image. That is, while transmitting the image the sender will encrypt the image using the application here sender gets the two or more <b>transparencies</b> of the same image. The application provides an option to the end user of encryption. The end user can divide the original image into number of different images. Using the application we can send encrypted images that are in the format of GIF and PNG. The encrypted <b>transparencies</b> can be saved in the machine and can be sent to the intended person by other means...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS An {{inexpensive}} feature card {{retrieval system}} has been combined with the Systematised Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) to provide simple but efficient means of indexing and filing 2 in. x 2 in. <b>transparencies</b> within a department of pathology. Using this system 2400 <b>transparencies</b> and the associated index cards can be conveniently stored in one drawer of a standard filing cabinet. The preparation of photographic <b>transparencies</b> of pathological specimens requires expertise and the expenditure of considerable time and money. This effort is largely wasted if the <b>transparencies</b> cannot readily be retrieved from storage. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe an efficient and inexpensive filing and retrieval system for 2 in. x 2 in. trans-parencies which have been coded with the System-atised Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) (1965).
