5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. <b>The</b> <b>Haitian</b> refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E
50|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>Haitians,</b> {{people from}} other {{countries}} are starting to use the border between Assis Brasil and the Peruvian city of Iñapari as a gateway to Brazil.

5000|$|After <b>the</b> 2010 <b>Haitian</b> earthquake, 324 Haitians {{relocated}} to Mexico via a Mexican naval ship from January 12 to late April 2010. According to the National Migration Institute (INM), each Haitian would be granted a [...] "humanitarian visa," [...] {{allowing them to}} work and study in Mexico, use public services, and travel to and from <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>Haitians</b> settled primarily in Mexico City, Pachuca, and Monterrey. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> who moved after the earthquake had relatives who were already living in Mexico.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Haitian</b> {{government}} did not request international assistance, although The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> Red-Cross, which were already working in Haiti, took on some supporting roles. In response to local flooding, the Jacmel Regional branch of the Red Cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets, 11 boxes of high-energy biscuits, and 10 boxes of body soap.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/Haiti border on December 4, 56hours prior to landfall.

50|$|Aside from Danticat’s use of symbolism, foreshadowing is also heavily prevalent. For example, {{the doctors}} states that “many of us {{start out as}} twins in the belly and do away with each other (Ch.4, p.19).” This foreshadows not only the death of Rafael, but also the fate of <b>the</b> <b>Haitians.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Haitians</b> and <b>the</b> Dominican both hail from the same island and {{struggle}} to survive among the same resources. 1 However, it is the Dominicans who try {{to do away with}} <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> in <b>the</b> form of the killings. In addition, the twins serve as further foreshadowing in terms of the Rosalinda’s caul and Rafael’s death. The caul served as an omen of bad luck to come and Rafael’s unexpected death foreshadowed many more deaths, such as the sudden death of Kongo’s son and the unprecedented number of deaths of Haitians.|$|R

5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> Garde-Cotes d'Haiti.

5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse Réunion were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary jury masts were fitted to Heureuse Réunion for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal. Heureuse Réunion was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|E
5|$|Auguste {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Jean Bazile Auguste and Lea Tzimoulis.

2500|$|The United States {{redesigned}} {{the education}} system. It dismantled the [...] "liberal arts" [...] education which <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> had inherited (and adapted) from the French system.

25|$|Leclerc ordered four French columns {{to march}} on Gonaives, which was <b>the</b> main <b>Haitian</b> base. One of the French columns was {{commanded}} by General Donatien de Rochambeau, a proud white supremacist and {{a supporter of}} slavery who detested <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> for wanting to be free and it was Rochambueau who Toussaint tried to stop at Ravin-a-Couleuvre, a very narrow gully {{up in the mountains}} that <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> had filled with chopped down trees. In the ensuring Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres, after six hours of fierce hand-to-hand fighting with no quarter given on either side, the French finally broke through, albeit with heavy losses. During the battle, Toussaint personally took part in the fighting to lead his men in charges against the French. After losing 800 men, Toussaint ordered a retreat.|$|R
5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music {{is characterized by the}} prominence of the quadrille dance, distinct from the French version and related to <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> mereng. The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.|$|E
5|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. <b>The</b> <b>Haitian</b> refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard; originally, the producers wanted to set the episode in Haiti and actually film in the country. This endeavor, however, proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti there still is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. <b>The</b> <b>Haitian</b> experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Racing {{reached the}} final matches against the {{previous}} champions, CD Guadalajara. It was originally planned to play both macthes in Guadalajara. However, because <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> {{did not receive}} their entry permit in time, the encounter had to be postponed. Since two other dates were not honored by <b>the</b> <b>Haitians,</b> <b>the</b> CD Guadalajara filed an official complaint with CONCACAF, which finally declared the Mexicans the winner. Racing then lodged a complaint which led CONCACAF to the decision announced on 2 April 1964 that the matches should now be compulsorily {{within the next two}} months. However, because Guadalajara had already planned a five-week Europareise at that time, the club renounced the final participation and the Racing Club Haïtien was now declared the winner by CONCACAF.|$|R
2500|$|On {{their arrival}} there {{they found that}} the French garrison's {{situation}} was desperate. General Dumont and his suite had been captured by <b>the</b> <b>Haitians,</b> and Cap-François was in imminent danger of falling to an army led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The French begged Bligh to intercede on behalf of Dumont, {{and he was able to}} secure the General and his staff's release. [...] Unable to defend Cap-François any longer, the commander there, Rochambeau, agreed to surrender it to <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> and evacuate by 30 November. Rochambeau then approached the commander of the British blockade, Commodore John Loring, and attempted to negotiate passage for his squadron from the port. The negotiations did not result in an acceptable agreement for either side, though Rochambeau was hopeful that his squadron would be able to escape the blockade under cover of bad weather. By 30 November the blockade was still in force, and <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> had begun to take possession of the forts surrounding the harbour, threatening to use their guns to destroy the French ships with heated shot. Loring sent Bligh into the harbour, where he met with Captain Henry Barré of the French squadron, who urged Bligh to arrange a capitulation to save the garrison and squadron from being destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>Haitians.</b> Bligh agreed and obtained the formal surrender of the port to the British, and arranged with Dessalines to allow their evacuation. The squadron then sailed out and surrendered to the British force.|$|R
5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and <b>the</b> warship. <b>The</b> <b>Haitians</b> boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|R
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} figure in <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{for all of}} Jamaica, for Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border, and for the Dominican Republic from Barahona to <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> border.

Hundreds of thousands were evacuated from vulnerable low-lying and coastal areas and disaster management programs were activated throughout the Greater Antilles.|$|E
5|$|On August 23 <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> {{government}} sent food, sachets of potable water, mattresses, and medicines to {{the town}} of Bainet in the Sud-Est department. On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to Sud-Est in 500 family bags. Hurricane assistance was then compounded by the country's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country's continued poverty crisis.|$|E
50|$|In 1871 Gómez led a {{campaign}} to clear Guantánamo from forces loyal to Spain, in particular the rich coffee growers - mostly of French descent whose their ancestors had fled from Haiti after <b>the</b> <b>Haitians</b> slaughtered <b>the</b> French.|$|R

5|$|Schneider {{left the}} Press in 1991, {{shortly before the}} {{newspaper}} was bought by the rival Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ceased publication. He spent several years at the Scripps-Howard Newspapers bureau in Washington D.C. as a reporter and assistant managing editor for investigations.

5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the {{political}} situation but with orders not to interfere in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion. Yeo's orders did not include Borgella's ships and Yeo reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> flagship, the large frigate Heureuse Réunion (recently renamed from Améthyste and often reported under its former name), presented {{a serious threat to}} international trade in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the American {{merchant}} vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, Experiment, {{was a much}} more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton Experiment was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. <b>The</b> <b>Haitian</b> craft were each equipped {{with a mix of}} swivel guns and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking en masse they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.|$|E
