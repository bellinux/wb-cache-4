5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds.

Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. <b>This</b> <b>act</b> was established in 1992. <b>This</b> <b>act</b> made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
