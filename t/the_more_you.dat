5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> see something, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

The block, MiTelemundo, premiered on July 7, 2012 and also airs Saturday and Sunday mornings; as with its predecessors, it consists of Spanish dubbed versions of programs seen on its sister broadcast network's Saturday morning block, NBC Kids, which debuted on the same date.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E
25|$|As an NBC owned-and-operated station, KXAS {{differs from}} many network-owned {{stations}} {{in that it}} does not carry its associated network's complete programming schedule. The station currently does not clear NBC's weekday overnight lineup, opting instead to air syndicated programming after Last Call with Carson Daly; it has never cleared the network's broadcast of CNBC's Mad Money during NBC's carriage of the program from September 2012 until the network replaced it with an extended rolling block of Early Today in September 2017, although it did air the rebroadcast of the fourth hour of Today from its addition to the overnight block in September 2011 until September 2015. In addition, KXAS also airs <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> Know educational block on a one-hour delay due to the 9:00a.m. hour of its Saturday morning newscast (which itself airs as a split two-hour format bookending the Saturday edition of Today), resulting in the third hour of the block being shifted to Sundays whenever network sports telecasts are scheduled on Saturdays during the noon hour or earlier in order to meet FCC educational programming quotas.|$|E

In their review, Famitsu praised the game's consistent balancing present throughout the game as well as commenting that while the player is having fun exploring, {{there is always a}} constant tension around.

500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The more you learn, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> know that you don't know anything at all."

[...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that, [...] "it’s a measure of a show’s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, and have that character’s subsequent survival not be a cheat", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance—although pointing out that she [...] "is largely pushed to the side for the majority" [...] of the episode—and Lea's reappearance, noting that [...] "it's always fun to see Krycek". However, he argued that the conclusion [...] "makes less sense <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> think about it", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully [...] "makes up for the contrivance." ...|$|E
