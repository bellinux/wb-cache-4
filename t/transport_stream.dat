50|$|The MPEG <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> is {{the only}} {{standard}} protocol universally used for real-time transport of broadcast audio and video media today. Even when tunneled over IP, the MPEG <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream</b> is the universal lowest-common-denominator of all long-distance audio and video transport. In the US, it can be broadcast to homes as the ATSC Transport Stream; in Europe, it is broadcast to homes as the DVB-T <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream.</b> All broadcast satellite transmissions {{see it as the}} DVB-S <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>stream</b> has {{a concept}} of programs. Every single program is {{described}} by a Program Map Table (PMT) which has a unique PID, and the elementary streams associated with that program have PIDs listed in the PMT. For instance, a <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> used in digital television might contain three programs, to represent three television channels. Suppose each channel consists of one video stream, one or two audio streams, and any necessary metadata. A receiver wishing to decode a particular [...] "channel" [...] merely has to decode the payloads of each PID associated with its program. It can discard the contents of all other PIDs. A <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> {{with more than one}} program is referred to as MPTS - Multi Program <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream.</b> A single program <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> is referred to as SPTS - Single Program <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream.</b>|$|E

50|$|Each {{table or}} {{elementary}} stream in a <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> is identified by a 13-bit packet identifier (PID). A demultiplexer extracts elementary streams from the <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> {{in part by}} looking for packets identified by the same PID. In most applications, time-division multiplexing {{will be used to}} decide how often a particular PID appears in the <b>transport</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{the actual}} DVB-S {{standard}} only specifies physical link characteristics and framing, the overlaid <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2, known as MPEG <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> (MPEG-TS).|$|E
50|$|For transport, ATSC {{uses the}} MPEG systems specification, {{known as an}} MPEG <b>transport</b> <b>stream,</b> to {{encapsulate}} data, subject to certain constraints. ATSC uses 188-byte MPEG <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> packets to carry data. Before decoding of audio and video takes place, the receiver must demodulate and apply error correction to the signal. Then, the <b>transport</b> <b>stream</b> may be demultiplexed into its constituent streams.|$|E

For example, MPEG2 <b>transport</b> <b>streams</b> that require clock synchronization between the server and client can include transport time stamps (TTS) as defined by ARIB TTS (ARIB STD-B24) which are derived from the 802.1AS clock. Similarly, an application could utilize clock synchronization through methods described in ISO 13818-1 Annex J which includes a discussion of various clock recovery schemes proposed for MPEG2 <b>Transport</b> <b>Streams</b> over jitter inducing networks, and figure J.2 illustrates {{a simple way to}} use the 802.1AS clock for this purpose.|$|R
