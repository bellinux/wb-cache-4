5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> domain of schools, even after they had become more common.

Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on {{by an increase in}} hormones such as testosterone.

The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian Heavy Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E

5|$|Hitler sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German {{people in}} Eastern Europe and his {{aggressive}} {{foreign policy is}} considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In {{the final days of}} the war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as an analyst at the CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E
