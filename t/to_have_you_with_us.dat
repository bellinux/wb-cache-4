6000|$|... "We {{are glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on any terms, and I {{take it as}} {{particularly}} kind, {{that you did not}} pass my door. You have been here some days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conductor}} came in. He {{had once}} called at Babbitt's office, {{to ask about}} houses. [...] "H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> to Chicago? This your boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' {{a little}} trip," [...] said Jethro, almost apologetically, [...] "and {{we kind of}} thought we'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Didn't we, Cynthy? Er--we might see General Grant," [...] he added meaningly.|$|E
6000|$|Henry turned submissively away; but Bedford tarried {{an instant}} to say, 'Fair sister, he is sore distressed. It would comfort him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> him. He <b>has</b> longed for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not stay}} behind with us until your father returns? You {{know that you}} would be most welcome, and that it would gladden all our hearts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This noon. It's all arranged, daddy, and you'll {{just have}} a glorious time with the old colonel. Bless his dear heart, he'll be overjoyed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> him, at last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As to that,' said Mr. Kendal, in the {{deliberate}} tone which denoted dissatisfaction, 'though {{of course it}} would be the greatest blessing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> I think you may trust Gilbert to my care. And we must consider poor Sophia.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} to pay, very handsomely, while you are with us, Bob, {{so it will be}} really a great help to us. Besides, we will like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> But you will have to work hard at Spanish, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all right, Lisle. It {{has been}} a {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> I am sure we shall all be sorry to lose you, but I hope that some day we shall meet again, when you are an officer {{in one of our}} regiments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much more useful, major; and indeed, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{youth and}} good spirits, and good spirits are very scarce here. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> heard the last news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I {{talk about}} it, Ayala? There isn't such a thing. But yet,--but yet; oh, Ayala, {{do you not}} know that <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me {{would be better than}} anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't like, Ralph. In {{the first place}} I want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me; and in the second, {{you will be a}} large landowner, and {{property}} has its duties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After that, I {{will have}} to turn back," [...] he continued. [...] "I have strict orders to go but so far from Fort Pitt, and no further. You see we may be needed there, if the redskins {{contemplate}} an attack." [...] "That is true," [...] said James Morris. [...] "I should like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but orders are orders.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} are come. Perhaps you {{understand}} all about cameos, and can tell me if these are really good. I wished <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not time. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three days. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are delighted}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> however you came here," [...] replied the Clown; [...] "and as for your getting home again, why, that is worry, {{and no one}} ever worries in the Valley of Clowns. You are welcome to remain our guests as long as you please, and while you are with us you must {{consider}} us your slaves, for Clowns have always been the slaves of children." [...] Then he turned to the others.|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear boy, if I didn't like <b>you</b> I wouldn't <b>have</b> made <b>you</b> the offer. It {{is because}} I like {{you so much}} that I want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's so ungrateful of me, but--but, though I {{know you}} care for me, and I like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, I'd--I'd even {{sacrifice}} you, if that would bring me what I want.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be so}} nice! And then I {{shall be}} sure <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me the first moment I see them. I shall think it very awful when I first meet your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, lad! We shall all be {{very glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> You can {{remain in the}} {{bungalow}} {{as long as you}} like. It {{is not likely to be}} wanted, for some months. Your father's butler and one or two servants will be enough to look after you; and you will, of course, remain a member of the mess. In this way, I hope you will have recovered some of your cheerfulness before you start." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{a day of}} sight-seeing we returned, at sunset, to the Springs, {{with all}} of the pomp of railway magnates en tour, and as we were about to part at the railway station, the General in curt, off-hand way, asked, [...] "Why not join my camping party at Sierra Blanca? We're going down there for a week or two, and I shall be very glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Come, and stay as long as you can. We shall {{probably}} move on to Wagon Wheel Gap later. Wagon Wheel ought to interest you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true enough, Godfrey. Anyhow, I am {{glad you}} are not old enough. I don't mean that I should not like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but {{then there would be}} nobody at home with mother. Now, if {{anything}} happens to father and me, she has got you, and as you grow up {{you will be able to}} look after her, and take care of her. It is bad enough for her having two of us in the war. It would be worse, still, if there were three." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! Sir Oliver Buttesthorn!" [...] cried Sir Nigel. [...] "I <b>had</b> {{heard that}} <b>you</b> were come into camp, and <b>had</b> hoped <b>to</b> see <b>you.</b> Glad and proud shall I be <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, Dicky. If we {{win this}} {{campaign}} I will certainly ask {{for you as}} adjutant. I shall be awfully glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, and I really do want an adjutant for each battalion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me again, for I have {{conceived}} a strong friendship for you, and think none the worse {{of you for}} your showing your gratitude to the family in whom you are interested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is well, Philip. I {{will be glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> my nephew. La Noue {{wrote to}} me, a month since, saying that both my son and you had borne yourselves very gallantly; that he was well pleased to have had you with him; and that he thought that, if these wars of {{religion}} continued--which they might well do for a long time, as in Germany and Holland, {{as well as in}} France, the reformed religion is battling for freedom--you would both rise to eminence as soldiers.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Mr. Atherton, {{about what}} I was saying just now, {{do not you}} think it would be more {{pleasant}} for you to erect a fresh hut close to ours instead of living by yourself away in the woods? It would be a great pleasure to all of us <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Your society would brighten our life here. We should have the assistance of your rifle in case the natives broke out again. You would, of course, live with us, but you would have your own hut to retire to when you liked to be alone. What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{are quite}} our equal, youngster,” {{said one of}} the midshipmen, “whatever you may be by birth. Not one of us could have worked half so well as you have done; the {{chaplain}} tells us that you can take an observation as well as he can. I can assure you we are all heartily glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Sit down and make yourself at home. We have not much to offer you besides our rations; for we have been out for over a month, and our soft tack and all other luxuries were finished long ago, so we are reduced to ham and biscuit.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nonsense!" [...] George said. [...] "I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, Bill; I should really. Besides, what's the {{difference}} between us? We <b>have</b> both got <b>to</b> work for ourselves and make our way in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, Captain Lindsay. I have {{frequently}} heard my brother speak of your services, and your perfect knowledge of Mahratti, and your acquaintance with its {{people will be}} of great value to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Margaret, for God's sake don't {{talk like}} that. I love you--I want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me always. Won't <b>you</b> come away <b>with</b> me {{and let me}} take care of you? I promise you that no harm shall come to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now after Sir Ewaine and Sir Percival had {{refreshed}} {{themselves and}} bathed themselves and had clad themselves as aforetold, there {{came to them}} a certain dignitary of the castle, who brought them word that {{the lord of the}} castle desired to have speech with them. So they two went down with that attendant, and he brought them to the great hall of the castle where was the lord thereof, standing to give them welcome. He was a haughty and noble worthy with a long gray beard and he was clad in a dark purple robe embroidered with silver. When he beheld Sir Ewaine and Sir Percival coming into that place, he hastened to meet them and give them greeting and welcome beyond stint. And he said: [...] "Welcome, welcome, fair lords! Thrice welcome to this castle! For certes it is a great glory to us all <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Moreover, I may tell you that already there is one of your fellows here at this place, and I believe you will be very glad to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Immediately on {{the arrival}} of the train at the London platform, Florence espied Cecilia, and in a minute was in her arms. There was a special {{tenderness}} in her sister-in-law's caress, which at once told Florence that her fears had not been without cause. Who has not felt the evil tidings conveyed by the exaggerated tenderness of a special kiss? But while on the platform and among the porters she said nothing of herself. She asked after Theodore and heard of the railway confederacy with a show of delight. [...] "He'd like to make a line from Hyde Park Corner to the Tower of London," [...] said Florence, with a smile. Then she asked after the children, and specially for the baby; but as yet she spoke no word of Harry Clavering. The trunk and the bag were at last found; and the two ladies were packed into a cab, and had started. Cecilia, when they were seated, got hold of Florence's hand, and pressed it warmly. [...] "Dearest," [...] said she, [...] "I am so glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> once again." [...] "And now," [...] said Florence, speaking with a calmness that was almost unnatural, [...] "tell me all the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What you say {{is right}} enough, under {{ordinary}} circumstances, but these are altogether extraordinary. Then, after what you have done, he will feel it but natural that we should wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for a time. Moreover, I do not consider that our journey will be altogether unattended by danger. From what I have heard of de Tulle, {{he is a man}} who never forgives, and will pursue his object with the pertinacity of a bloodhound. He has failed in his first attempt, but {{there is no reason why}} he should not renew it, confident, perhaps, that if successful the king, though he may feel it necessary to feign much anger for a time, will finally forgive him and take him into favour again, especially as his family would bring all their influence to bear to bring this about. Doubtless, he will be kept perfectly informed of what is going on here. There are several forests to be traversed on the way, and these are, for the most part, the haunts of robber bands; and, should the carriage be found overturned, and the baron and his daughter missing, it would be put down as their work. Having the baron as well as his daughter in his power, de Tulle would find it easier than before to compel Anne to purchase her father's freedom, as well as her own, by consenting to his terms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, Ramoo, <b>you</b> {{will stay}} <b>with</b> {{me for the}} present. I hardly know what I shall be doing for a time, but I am sure that until I settle down, Miss Conyers will be very glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Frank suggested, [...] "you might arrange <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a room {{also in the}} house. It {{would not}} be a very long walk, not above twenty or five and twenty minutes, and I should be so glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do," [...] he insisted. [...] "I love <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me, I {{love to see}} you happy, I shall love to {{give you}} pretty things. I shall be proud of you, soothed by you--and rested. What do you say, Sophy?" ...|$|R
