5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E

Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too small and would get hurt. He was eventually selected {{to play for the}} senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni. Serevi's Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji's sevens tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's first {{fight of}} 2004, was a fourth-round {{knockout}} {{victory over the}} former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his luggage to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an unaccompanied minor.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} {{whether or not he}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> part of the play.|$|E

5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> essential {{to the future of}} the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E

A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

Rohan and Pooja are married, and the family hold a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

Yusef meets up with Tariq and offers him his daughter's restaurant. Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab.

Yusef admits to Zainab that he started the fire and kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia {{proceeded}} to reach 460/7Keith Miller making 74before Bradman declared, setting England {{a target of}} 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
