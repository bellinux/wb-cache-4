50|$|Piloting a Landmate is {{a unique}} experience, given that the craft behaves as an {{extension}} of the human body, one <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> everything its wearer is doing. There are seemingly no physical controls in the cockpit, rather control is accomplished through motion-capture technology (ironically, very similar to that used to animate the movies) via the pilot's Datasuit, an undergarment that records nerve and muscle impulses. The electrostatic information gathered by the suit is then wirelessly relayed to a central processing unit, that manipulates the various motors and joint servos in order to mimic the pilot's motions in a proportionate, but much bigger scale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{release of}} The Trio, Live {{prompted}} Schofield to {{be featured in}} a Guitarist magazine article, listing the nine notable up and coming blues guitarists, Schofield being the only non-American. Of the album they said [...] "britblues meets jazz via N'Orleans - all played {{with the kind of}} sizzling guitar <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not often surface in Fairford, Gloucestershire". In 2007, Guitar & Bass Magazine picked Schofield as one of the [...] "Top 10 British Blues Guitarists of All Time". In August 2009, Schofield released Heads, Tails, & Aces, his third studio effort. The next year (2010) the band collected the Album of the Year award at the British Blues Awards for this album, and released Live from the Archive, recorded in 2007 in the Netherlands. Schofield won the British Blues Guitarist and Jonny Henderson won the British Keyboard Player award, and they both won these awards in 2011, too.|$|E
5000|$|The PCjr's {{cost was}} its biggest disadvantage, {{even more so}} than the keyboard. The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that customers [...] "find that the PCjr is expensive for a home computer but isn't very powerful for an expensive computer." [...] Ahoy! wrote that [...] "a machine with relatively limited technology at a relatively high price, not only presented much less of a threat than the industry had feared", but benefited the C64 by encouraging Atari and Coleco to raise prices. IBM did not say whether the target market was the home, schools, or executives working at home, confusing software developers, but likely erred by setting the PCjr's price in the US$800-$1,600 range, where demand was weaker than for computers that cost less—especially the C64—or more. Norton warned that the PCjr [...] "may well be targeted at a gray area in the market <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not exist", and an observer estimated that [...] "perhaps only 10 to 15% of the home market will be interested".|$|E

[...] It was [...] "...not at all like such clean, crisp, honest, American names as Cathcart, Peckem and Dreedle." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{more and}} more {{services}} are developed, {{there is a constant}} risk that services with redundant functionality may be created. Although the application of the Service Normalization design pattern does help to eliminate this redundancy, however, just by having a set of normalized services on its own, does not guarantee that they would be reused as originally envisaged. In case of agnostic services, this issue can severely restrict the actual reuse of such services because a project team (Team A) may decide not to reuse an existing service, e.g. it requires data that corresponds to a complex schema, and instead develop a lightweight service <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> the job. As a result, the same reusable logic now exists with two different services, whereas the existing service should have been evolved even if it did not contain the most suitable flavor of the functionality. This effect gets multiplied when another team (Team B) hoping to find the functionality within the existing service, as the boundary of the service does cover the required functionality, fails to find it and instead start using the newly created service by Team A. Consequently, the actual reusability of the original agnostic service drops {{and at the same time}} creates governance problem as far as the maintenance of the original and new services is concerned because now reusable logic exists in a decentralized manner.|$|E
40|$|This {{appraisal}} of David Scott FitzGerald and David Cook-Martín's Culling the Masses: The Democratic Origins of Racist Immigration Policy in the Americas argues {{that there is}} no ‘elective affinity’ between liberalism and racism, which is the core argument of the book. The notion of ‘elective affinity’, which the authors borrow from Max Weber, requires a structural homology between the ‘electively’ related elements <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not exist in this case. The relationship between both is entirely contingent, ‘racism’ being a doctrine of inter-group relations while ‘liberalism’ is a doctrine of intra-group relations, with no consideration of how the boundaries of the group are constituted...|$|E
40|$|Others in the XP {{community}} (Beck, Fowler, et al.) {{have talked}} {{about the need to}} adapt XP to local conditions. They have addressed the "why" question in some depth, but not completely. They also have not addressed the "how" question beyond rather general statements. We will attempt to complete the "why" and to answer the "how. " Introspection is an internal habit that every member of the development team needs to have. They should be thinking about how their process could be better. When they come upon what we call a process smell (i. e. something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not feel right about their process), this is a signal to think about what the root cause might be. The practice of retrospectives makes those thoughts public. The combination of these two allows a team to adapt XP {{in a way that is}} consistent with its values, principles, and practices...|$|E

30|$|Then, {{analyze the}} second project using B 1 as the {{available}} budget yielding an NCV {{after the second}} project of NCV 2 {{which in turn is}} relabeled B 2 and is used to evaluate the next project and so on. In this way, one has parlayed the original budget (stake) sequentially so that after N projects one has an amount NCVN. The assumption here is that one does not have a sufficient decline in the sequential NCV so that one cannot invest in some of the later projects. As such, this procedure has a similarity to betting on horse races at a track with each race following the next and winnings from each race are parlayed onto a bet for the next race. In short, one assumes from a hydrocarbon exploration prospective that there is complete reinvestment of capital in each sequential prospect—something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not occur in reality except for small corporations.|$|E

"Sure, {{you ought}} to be filmed, one has to do such things, for money and all <b>that.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>do</b> not forget <b>that</b> you belong to us, and never leave theatre for good," [...] Nemirovich-Danchenko was telling her. In retrospect, she failed to heed this advice and later regretted it. There were {{objective}} reasons for this, though. At the height of the Big Purge many theatres got closed, actors rushed to MAT where Stanislavski has lost his influence and Ladynina was feeling less and less comfortable.|$|R

40|$|Apparently {{sophisticated}} {{school performance}} {{measures have been}} used to claim that giving schools autonomy from local government control improves pupil exam performance. This paper explores the extent to which inferring causality between autonomy and pupil achievement is reasonable given that pupils are not randomly assigned to schools and schools do not randomly acquire autonomous status. Rich administrative data and the Longitudinal Survey of Young People in England are used to evaluate whether school performance measures are confounded by pupil characteristics that explain both the chances of attending an autonomous school and academic achievement. The assignment of grant-maintained (and thus now foundation) status through a vote of parents is used to compare school <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not, gain autonomy over a decade ago.

50|$|An {{alternate}} {{approach to}} {{determining whether a}} contract is partially or totally integrated is the Corbin approach.

In this approach, anything that doesn't contradict the written terms is a consistent term and the court can assume that oral agreements may have happened as part of this same contract if they were consistent terms.
