5|$|Robert and his mysterious friend Bertram {{are among}} a group of knights who are {{preparing}} to compete in a tournament for the hand of Princess Isabelle. They all praise wine, women and gambling (Versez à tasses pleines). Robert's attendant Raimbaut sings a ballad about a beautiful princess from Normandy who married a devil; the princess had a son, Robert, known as 'le diable'. Robert indignantly reveals that he is the son in question and condemns Raimbaut to death. Raimbaut begs for pardon and tells Robert that he is engaged to marry. Robert relents and relishes <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> droit du seigneur. Raimbaut's fianceé arrives; Robert recognizes her as his foster-sister Alice and pardons Raimbaut. Alice tells Robert that his mother has died and that her last words were a warning about a threatening dark force (Va! Va! dit-elle). She offers Robert his mother's will. Robert is too overcome to read it and asks Alice to keep it for the present. Robert expresses his longing for his beloved Isabelle and Alice offers to take a letter to her. Alice warns Robert to beware of Bertram but he ignores her. With Bertram's encouragement, Robert gambles with the knights and loses all of his money, as well as his armour.|$|E

25|$|Time and Narrative secured Ricœur's {{return to}} France in 1985 as a notable intellectual. His late work was characterised by a {{continuing}} cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions; for example, {{some of his}} latest writing engaged <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American political philosopher John Rawls.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the thought of writing {{constitutional}} law in Iran has existed since when Ruhollah Khomeini was driven away to Paris before {{the overthrow of the}} Pahlavi dynasty in the Iranian Revolution. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian constitution had existed {{in the second half of}} 1979 and its early draft had been written in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is {{a school}} of thought within anarchism which puts an {{emphasis}} on environmental issues. An important early influence was <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American anarchist Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden as well as Leo Tolstoy and Elisee Reclus. In the late 19th century there emerged anarcho-naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France, Spain and Portugal. Important contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.|$|E

25|$|Pictures of {{the once}} majestic trees broken and {{abandoned}} in formerly pristine groves, and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused {{most of the}} groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at Big Stump Grove near General Grant Grove. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in Sequoia National Forest, publicity of which helped lead {{to the creation of}} Giant Sequoia National Monument.|$|E
25|$|Yohannan Hormizd {{was unhappy}} with <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{unbroken}} succession of the Eliya line ending with his death, and made a curious bargain with the Nestorian church {{in an attempt to}} continue the succession. He ordained his nephew Mansur Sefaro a priest, and in 1831 sent him to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham (1820–61), who consecrated him at Urmi and appointed him metropolitan over the Nestorians of Amadiya. The new metropolitan took the name Eliya, the traditional name of the Chaldean patriarchs, and shortly afterwards abandoned the pretence of being a Nestorian and was re-admitted into the Chaldean church, ultimately becoming the first Chaldean bishop of Aqra in 1852.|$|E
25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. This inquiry included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to know the facts behind the case, he was not enamored of <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case {{had taken on a}} life of its own, independent of Charles.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the {{philosophy}} of Nietzsche has had great intellectual and political influence around the world. Nietzsche applied himself to such topics as morality, religion, epistemology, psychology, ontology, and social criticism. Because of Nietzsche's evocative style and his often outrageous claims, his philosophy generates passionate reactions running from love to disgust. Nietzsche noted in his autobiographical Ecce Homo that his philosophy developed over time, so interpreters have found it difficult to relate concepts central to one work to those central to another, for example, <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eternal recurrence features heavily in Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra), but is almost entirely absent from his next book, Beyond Good and Evil. Added to this challenge is the fact that Nietzsche did not seem concerned to develop his thought into a system, even {{going so far as to}} disparage the attempt in Beyond Good and Evil.|$|E
25|$|Polish Enlightenment, while sharing many common qualities {{with the}} {{classical}} Enlightenment movements of Western Europe, also differed {{from them in}} many important aspects. Much of <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Enlightenment evolved under the oppressive absolute monarchies and was dedicated towards fighting for more freedom. Western thinkers desired Montesquieu's separation and balance of powers to restrict the nearly unlimited power of their monarchs. Polish Enlightenment, however, developed {{in a very different}} background. The Polish political system was almost the opposite of the absolute monarchy: Polish kings were elected and their position was very weak, with most of the powers {{in the hands of the}} parliament (Sejm). Polish reforms desired the elimination of laws that transformed their system into a near-anarchy, resulting from abuse of consensus voting in Sejm (liberum veto) that paralyzed the Commonwealth, especially during the times of the Wettin dynasty, reducing Poland from a major European player to the puppet of its neighbours. Thus, while men of the Enlightenment in France and Prussia wrote about the need for more checks and balances on their kings, Polish Enlightenment was geared towards fighting the abuses stemming from too many checks and balances.|$|E

Balcon, who produced the film, chose Robert Hamer as director and warned him that [...] "You are trying to sell that most unsaleable commodity to the British – irony. Good luck to you."

500|$|Weed {{sometimes}} expressed {{certainty that}} Seward would be nominated; {{at other times}} he expressed gloom at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convention fight. He had some reason for doubt, as word from Weed's agents across the country was mixed. Many in the Midwest {{did not want the}} issue of slavery to dominate the campaign, and with Seward as nominee, it inevitably would. The Know Nothing Party was still alive in the Northeast, and was hostile to Seward for his pro-immigrant stances, creating doubts as to whether Seward could win Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where there were many nativists, in the general election. [...] These states were crucial to a Republican nominee faced with a Solid South. Conservative factions in the evolving Republican Party opposed Seward.|$|E

500|$|Gaddafi's ideological worldview was moulded by his environment, namely his Islamic faith, his Bedouin upbringing, and his disgust at {{the actions}} of European colonialists in Libya. As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the {{ideologies}} of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, influenced in particular by Nasserism, <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian President Nasser, whom Gaddafi regarded as his hero. During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as Third International Theory, which {{has been described as}} a combination of [...] "utopian socialism, Arab nationalism, and the Third World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time". He regarded this system as a practical alternative to the then-dominant international models of Western capitalism and Marxism–Leninism. He laid out the principles of this Theory in the three volumes of The Green Book, in which he sought to [...] "explain the structure of the ideal society." ...|$|E
500|$|After his wife's death, PedroI {{realized}} how miserably he had treated her, and {{his relationship with}} Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping {{on the floor and}} embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost PedroI claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: [...] "Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress does not leave me." [...] He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed {{on more than one occasion}} holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: [...] "Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{literary}} finish of the surviving written versions, the tale remains one to be told orally.

[...] "The story-teller makes use of the element of surprise, of quick developments and dramatic moments. [...] He seeks to impress by rapid crescendo to a startling climax, and a shock"; as when Cet first reluctantly yields to Conall Cernach {{in the absence of}} Ánluan, then is unexpectedly and abruptly shamed {{in full view of the}} warriors of Ireland, by Conall suddenly hurling the head-trophy of Ánluan [...] "at the breast of his opponent with such violence that a gush of blood burst through Cet's lips".|$|E
