25|$|The Royal Burmese Army's {{performance}} vis-a-vis European forces grew {{worse as}} the <b>technology</b> <b>gap</b> grew wider. The fight against European forces {{was already a}} challenge even in the relatively low-tech matchlock era. The Burmese victory at Syriam in 1613, which drove out the Portuguese from Burma for good, came after a month's siege. In the flintlock era, mid-18th century, a French-defended Syriam (led by {{just a few hundred}} French troops) held out for 14 months before finally captured by Alaungpaya's forces in 1756.|$|E
25|$|Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, a MMR follow on, the APAR project aims {{to field}} a fully fledged {{operational}} AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 {{version of the}} Light Combat Aircraft. This will be the second airborne AESA programme after the AEW project and intends to transfer the success DRDO has achieved in the ground based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR programme aims to prevent this <b>technology</b> <b>gap</b> from developing, with a broad based programme to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the Burmese put up {{the best}} fight in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), the longest and most {{expensive}} war in British Indian history. The campaign cost the British five million to 13 million pounds sterling (roughly 18.5 billion to 48 billion in 2006 US dollars), and 15,000 men. But for the Burmese, {{it was the beginning}} of the end of their independence. Not only did they lose their entire western and southern territories by the Treaty of Yandabo, a whole generation of men had been wiped out on the battlefield. After 30 years of growing <b>technology</b> <b>gap,</b> the outcome of Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852) was never in doubt. Lower Burma was lost. Another three decades later, the Third Anglo-Burmese War (1885) lasted less than a month. The entire country was gone.|$|E

40|$|In {{studies of}} the {{greenhouse}} gas implications of convergence by developing countries to the per-capita GNPs of developed countries, considerable discussion has centred on whether purchasing power parity (PPP) or market exchange rates (MER) {{should be used in}} measuring per-capita GNPs. We suggest that <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> between developing and developed countries should be the starting point for convergence analysis rather than per-capita GNP gaps. We estimate two sets of initial <b>technology</b> <b>gaps,</b> using PPP and MER price assumptions combined with input-output data. In simulating the effects of closing <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> (convergence) using a dynamic, multi-country CGE model, we find:(1) the MER/PPP distinction matters. MER-based estimates of initial <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> lead to higher estimates of convergence-induced growth in greenhouse-gas-emitting industries in developing countries than do PPP-based estimates. (2) the industry detail in CGE models is valuable. Our simulations show a wide range of convergence-induced changes in output across industries...|$|R

2500|$|The Dutch subjugated the Minangkabau of Sumatra in the Padri War (1821–38) and the Java War (1825–30) ended {{significant}} Javanese resistance. The Banjarmasin War (1859–1863) {{in southeast}} Kalimantan {{resulted in the}} defeat of the Sultan. After failed expeditions to conquer Bali in 1846 and 1848, an 1849 intervention brought northern Bali under Dutch control. The most prolonged military expedition was the Aceh War in which a Dutch invasion in 1873 was met with indigenous guerrilla resistance and ended with an Acehnese surrender in 1912. Disturbances continued to break out on both Java and Sumatra during the remainder of the 19th century. [...] However, the island of Lombok came under Dutch control in 1894, and Batak resistance in northern Sumatra was quashed in 1895.

30|$|Motzek et al. {{introduce}} {{an approach}} towards OIA {{based on a}} probabilistic graphical model in [11], which defines a well-understood problem onto which an OIA can be reduced. To obtain a consistent model, various experts must be consulted, and information origins from various different perspectives coming from different expertises. In effect, experts, i.e., models, will contain disagreements and contain semantic and <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> [11]. By resorting to a probabilistic model, the use of conditional probability distributions allows for local views on assessments, without a need to understand a specific use case nor any algorithmic properties. Therefore, OIA introduced by [11] is able to directly include all views by experts directly into one consistent model, bridging semantic and <b>technology</b> <b>gaps.</b> This is highly beneficial, as experts are not forced to come one bad compromise, but the model is able to understand emerging disagreements.|$|R

Subsea Production Systems connects subsea wells to offshore vessels, and enable efficient and safe hydrocarbon production. Using root cause analysis, {{cause and effect}} diagram, and Pareto charts in a specific company we identified three main drivers of cost and schedule overruns: qualification of products, changing vendors frequently, and project management. Detailed analyzes of a reference project found that the supplier identified {{about half of the}} <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> during the tender phase. Technology qualification programs of key components {{were not included in the}} bid, although the project had to pay for related cost overruns. In summary, the project could have eliminated more than two thirds of the cost escalation related to qualification costs by capturing all <b>technology</b> <b>gaps</b> in the early tendering phase, and as a result significantly increased the profitability...|$|R
