5|$|Production on {{the second}} series was delayed several times. While Adams {{was meant to be}} working on scripts for a stage {{adaptation}} of Hitchhiker's in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for Doctor Who and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for Not the Nine O'Clock News. The recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Strawberry Panic! {{revolves}} around {{the lives of the}} adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story {{revolves around}}, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.|$|E

25|$|The {{second of}} Hoyle's {{nucleosynthesis}} papers also introduced an interesting {{use of the}} anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out the routes of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus {{to have a very}} specific resonance energy and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles, which was later borne out by experiment.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} aspects of The Magician's Nephew {{parallel}} Lewis' own life. Both Digory and Lewis were {{children in the}} early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced {{with the death of}} their mothers in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was schooled in England after his mother's death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Lewis was a voracious reader when a child, Digory is also, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out how far they must travel along the attic space to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel.

25|$|Post tea-break, Sehwag and Dravid steadied the Indian innings {{further and}} carried forward to 278/1 along with Dravid, who, having come off 305 runs in Adelaide, {{had made a}} patient 49 from 89 balls with 5 boundaries. Steve Waugh gave himself an {{extended}} bowling spell, and against the run of play, produced a delivery which was well outside leg-stump, but Dravid aimed a shot to Damien Martyn at forward square leg, and it appeared that Dravid, who had faced a lot of short deliveries from Waugh, had not anticipated this delivery. Dravid's dismissal apparently did not hamper Sehwag's rapid progress, as he whipped a delivery to square-leg boundary with a flourish, off Brad Williams in the next over after the second wicket. However, Tendulkar was soon dismissed by Lee, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> a delivery in the legside fine. He was the third wicket to fall at 286/3. The Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle to join Sehwag, whose response to the two quick wickets was to just smash a MacGill delivery next over for a six above midwicket. However, Sehwag's approach hastened his end, as he {{was out in the}} 78th over, bowled by Simon Katich, the next ball after he had hit a six.|$|E
