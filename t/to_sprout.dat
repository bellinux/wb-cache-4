5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable <b>to</b> <b>sprout</b> from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it <b>to</b> <b>sprout</b> decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning <b>to</b> <b>sprout.</b> The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E

40|$|When Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{bacteria}} are added <b>to</b> alfalfa <b>sprouts</b> growing in water, the bacteria bind tightly <b>to</b> the <b>sprouts.</b> In contrast, laboratory K- 12 strains of E. coli do not bind <b>to</b> <b>sprouts</b> under similar conditions. The roles of E. coli O 157 :H 7 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), capsular polysaccharide, and exopolysaccharides in binding <b>to</b> <b>sprouts</b> were examined. An LPS mutant {{had no effect}} on the binding of the pathogenic strain. Cellulose synthase mutants showed a significant reduction in binding; colanic acid mutants were more severely reduced, and binding by poly-β- 1, 6 -N-acetylglucosamine (PGA) mutants was barely detectable. The addition of a plasmid carrying a cellulose synthase gene to K- 12 strains allowed them <b>to</b> bind <b>to</b> <b>sprouts.</b> A plasmid carrying the Bps biosynthesis genes had only a marginal effect on the binding of K- 12 bacteria. However, the introduction of the same plasmid allowed Sinorhizobium meliloti and a nonbinding mutant of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to bind to tomato root segments. These results suggest that although multiple redundant protein adhesins are involved in the binding of E. coli O 157 :H 7 <b>to</b> <b>sprouts,</b> the polysaccharides required for binding are not redundant and each polysaccharide may play a distinct role. PGA, colanic acid, and cellulose were also required for biofilm formation by a K- 12 strain on plastic, but not for the binding of E. coli O 157 :H 7 to mammalian cells...|$|R
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able <b>to</b> <b>sprout.</b> Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments <b>to</b> <b>sprout</b> all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E

40|$|Controlled {{laboratory}} and field experiments {{were performed to}} determine the developmental response to temperature and moisture of Arundo donax, a riparian invasive grass and potential bioenergy crop. A logistic function was parameterized and used to predict thermal times <b>to</b> <b>sprouting</b> and the nine-leaf stage. Consistent estimates of the base temperature (Tb) and base water potential (ψb) below which development ceases were obtained from various statistical and mathematical analyses. Estimates of Tb and ψb were 12. 7 ± 1. 7 °C and − 1. 56 ± 0. 43 MPa, respectively, for the median fraction of sprouting rhizomes. Median hydrothermal time <b>to</b> <b>sprouting</b> was 124. 1 MPa °Cd under laboratory conditions and median thermal times, or degree-day (°Cd), <b>to</b> <b>sprouting</b> and nine-leaf stage {{was estimated to be}} 94 and 129 °Cd under field conditions, respectively. A degree-day is defined as one day (24 h) spent one degree above Tb. Results demonstrated that thermal time alone is sufficient to accurately predict time <b>to</b> <b>sprouting</b> under field conditions. Further, there may be a fixed moisture threshold of about 6 % volumetric water content above which sprouting rate was constant. This threshold corresponded very closely to the − 1. 5 MPa for ψb that was estimated under laboratory conditions for the soil typically infested by A. donax. This information is crucial for assessing risk of invasive spread for A. donax...|$|R

Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them <b>to</b> <b>sprout</b> quickly after being charred.|$|E
5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning <b>to</b> <b>sprout</b> from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.|$|E
