500|$|Stephen Goode, {{a critic}} for Insight on the News, {{considered}} the piece {{to be the}} beginning of the Pop Art movement, labeling the work [...] "a sign of things to come as other artists tackled common yet sacrosanct items, including the American flag". Lichtenstein, reflecting on his work, told reporters, [...] "The idea of counterfeiting money always occurs <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do lithography". Despite the assessments of critics, Lichtenstein, in an interview with Joan Marter, considered the work to be [...] "a kind of Cubist dollar bill, not a Pop one". He continued, [...] "The fact it was a ten-dollar-bill at all [...] {{there was some kind of}} Pop influence on me that I wasn't aware of so much. They're really not Pop at all. They're more funny, or humorous, or something".|$|E
500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to you is the person next <b>to</b> <b>you</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> get into trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connolly credits one of John Bradshaw's {{publications}} {{with helping}} him {{deal with his}} past demons. [...] "He reckons that if this trauma happened <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And {{what you have to}} do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he's something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce {{was very}} fond of going on hunting excursions. Yu Fan told him, [...] "You {{gathered}} a mob, used them {{to rein in the}} wandering scholar-gentry, and earned their fervent allegiance towards you. Even Emperor Gao of Han can't be compared <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> dress casually and venture out, the officials who accompany you usually don't have enough time to prepare for the trip, while the servants and soldiers are getting tiresome. A leader who doesn't behave in a serious manner doesn't command respect. The White Dragon transformed into a fish for fun and ended up being trapped by the fisherman Yuqie (豫且); the White Serpent behaved recklessly and ended up being slain by Liu Bang. I hope you will be more careful." [...] Sun Ce replied, [...] "You're right. However, sometimes, when I'm thinking hard, I feel frustrated if I were to sit down and think. As such, I venture out in search of insight and inspiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirchner {{was then}} {{admitted}} to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where {{he continued to}} produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to [...] "In den Lärchen" [...] in Frauenkirch Davos where he rented a room {{on the first floor}} and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: [...] "I’m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt’s studio". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes [...] "A Painter's Credo" [...] where he states: [...] "There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man…. This is the last judgement, before them you stand….. They help you when you work. You can thank them only through work. When you want to die, they sometimes appear <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them". Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner's business there.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 Bjelke-Petersen faced {{criminal}} trial for perjury {{arising out of}} the evidence he had given to the Fitzgerald inquiry (an earlier proposed charge of corruption was incorporated into the perjury charge). Bjelke-Petersen's former police Special Branch bodyguard Sergeant Bob Carter told the court that in 1986 he had twice been given packages of cash totalling $210,000 at the premier's office. He was told {{to take them to}} a Brisbane city law firm and then watch as the money was deposited in a company bank account. The money had been given over by developer Sng Swee Lee, and the bank account was in the name of Kaldeal, operated by Sir Edward Lyons a trustee of the National Party. John Huey, a Fitzgerald Inquiry investigator, later told Four Corners: [...] "I said to Robert Sng, 'Well what did Sir Joh say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> gave him this large sum of money?' And he said, [...] "All he said was, 'thank you, thank you, thank you'." [...] The jury could not agree on a verdict. In 1992 it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, {{was a member of the}} Young Nationals and was identified with the [...] "Friends of Joh" [...] movement. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Bjelke-Petersen, then aged 81, was too old. Developer Sng Swee Lee refused to return from Singapore for a retrial. Bjelke-Petersen said his defence costs sent him broke.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} {{meanings}} of common sense, for the Romans {{of the classical}} era [...] "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection". But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's Timaeus (concerning a primordial [...] "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally {{use it as a}} technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in De Anima, and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages. Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of humanitas. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only human nature, but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on. Apart from Cicero, Quintilian, Lucretius, Seneca, Horace and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term [...] "sensus communis" [...] in a range of such ways. As C. S. Lewis wrote: Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd (congressus) how will he ever learn that sensus which we call communis? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> obviously don't want to talk lacks communis sensus.|$|E
