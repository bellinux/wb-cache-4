5000|$|A {{paper by}} Hopkins proposes {{a method for}} which <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> may navigate. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> is trying to reduce its {{alignment}} [...] "error", meaning {{it is trying to}} stay as parallel as it can with the electric field and reduce the angular difference between the electric field and the angle of its body. The equation to describe this orientation is ξh= ϕE-ϕF. ϕE represents the angle of the electric field. ϕF represents the angle of <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> taken from three body segments as <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> bends. ξh represents the error angle, which is how far off <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is from being parallel with the field(.

5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. <b>The</b> <b>fishing</b> industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E

40|$|As feeding is {{fundamental}} to any animal, this thesis examined constraints on foraging behaviour {{from the point of}} view of a predatory <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> threespine stickleback, encountering prey sequentially and simultaneously. Subsequent to prey detection, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> orientated towards <b>the</b> prey and then decided to attack. The probability of attack reduced with a decrease in fish size, an increase in the size of the prey and <b>the</b> <b>fish's</b> stomach fullness and was dependent on the presence of competitors. During the attack, if <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> hung midwater <b>the</b> probability of successful prey capture was greater. Hanging was more likely to occur with smaller fish and when larger prey were encountered and was also longer in duration when prey were encountered simultaneously. When handling <b>the</b> prey, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> made a decision to eat within the first few seconds. All of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ate to fill their stomachs, with the critical factors involved in prey choice being the size of the prey in relation to the size of <b>the</b> <b>fish's</b> mouth and <b>the</b> stomach fullness of <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> With an empty stomach, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ate whatever prey was encountered. As stomach fullness Increased <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> became selective against large prey with high handling costs, depending on the availability of alternative prey. Those prey selected for had low handling costs and were successfully captured whenever encountered.

5000|$|Through {{the use of}} {{high-speed}} cameras and hydrophones, the snake's method of ambush is revealed in greater detail. The snake anticipates the movements of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> as it attempts to escape. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims into range, the snake creates a disturbance in the water by moving part of its body posterior to the neck. This disturbance triggers an escape reflex in <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> called <b>the</b> C-start, in which <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> contorts its body into a [...] "C" [...] shape. Normally at this point <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> would swim quickly away from the disturbance by quickly straightening its body, but the snake grabs it, usually by the head, anticipating its movement. <b>The</b> snake catches <b>fish</b> by tricking them into reflexively attempting to escape in the wrong direction. Unlike most predators, the snake doesn’t aim for <b>the</b> <b>fish’s</b> initial position and then adjust its direction as <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> moves, it heads directly for the location where it expects <b>the</b> <b>fish’s</b> head to be.
