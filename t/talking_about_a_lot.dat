I did not agree at the beginning, afraid that we would {{end up with a}} real one, but if didn’t falsify the divorce, a {{pregnancy}} test would have to be done, and it would be terrible if the inspectors finds out. We started quarreling and fighting every day, so that everyone thought that two of us couldn’t maintain a family anymore. After a few days, I left, went back to my parents’ home, and the people in the neighborhood sincerely believed that we had divorced, so they all felt great pity for us. After two or three days, I quietly snuck back, staying at home and not going outside; my husband went out for work.|$|E

In this thesis it will be shown that typically masculine or feminine qualities have different origins than is commonly believed. ‘Natural’ female or male behavior is mostly seen to derive from hunter-gatherers who have influenced us in our actions. We are still fitted with a hunter-gatherer brain and therefore women can’t park cars and men can’t multi-task. This traditional idea has fundamental flaws and has a lack of theoretical foundation. It should be dealt with if we ever want more equality between men and women. If we continue to teach women that they should be caring, thoughtful, nice and generous, we are holding them back and are locking them in a certain stereotype. The same applies to men and the masculine qualities it is believed they should possess...|$|R

During the summer of 2015, I visited three museums and four art exhibitions in Nuuk and Copenhagen and analysed how they described Greenlandic culture. I was left with three main discourses: One being the Greenlander as a hunter – historical colonial views as depicted today; another being the threatened Greenlander in times of climate change, and lastly, Greenlanders as modern people in a country on its way to independence. I argue that the three trends I discovered, have their origin in different socioeconomic or political processes and that a majority of them can be described as having their origin in colonialism...|$|R
