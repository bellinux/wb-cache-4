5|$|During the fighting, the Hòa Hảo {{attempted}} {{to help the}} Bình Xuyên by attacking towns and government forces in their Mekong Delta heartland. Ba Cụt's men, who had also been angered by the recent arrest of some colleagues, blockaded the Mekong and Bassac rivers and laid siege to various towns, including Sa Đéc, Long Xuyên and Châu Đốc, stifling the regional economy. The Hòa Hảo shut down several important regional roads and stopped the flow of agricultural produce from the nation's most fertile region into the capital, causing food prices to rise by 50%, as meat and vegetables became scarce. Ba Cụt then attacked a battalion of VNA troops south of Sa Đéc. Soon after, they retreated to a Hòa Hảo citadel {{on the banks of}} the Bassac. After reinforcing their base, the Hòa Hảo proceeded to fire mortars across <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the city of Cần Thơ, which stood on the opposite side of the river. During this period, the United Front publicly accused Diệm of trying to bribe Ba Cụt with 100 million piasters.|$|E

25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{amphibians}} {{found in the}} Sundarbans are sawfish, butter fish, electric ray, common carp, silver carp, barb, river eels, starfish, king crab, fiddler crab, hermit crab, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs. One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that climbs out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the water phase diagram is that the solid–liquid phase line (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a {{negative}} slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the higher density phase, which causes melting.|$|E
50|$|Already from 1137 to 1143 the Archbishop of Salzburg had the Stiftsarm {{branch of}} the Almkanal built through the mountain, in order to lead <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city. This early adit system can be visited during the annual Almabkehr in September.|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} source of chloride ions is sea water. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5wt.% salts. These salts include sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and bicarbonates. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−) and migrate with <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the capillaries of the concrete. Chloride ions, which make up about 50% of these ions, are particularly aggressive {{as a cause of}} corrosion of carbon steel reinforcement bars.|$|E
25|$|The House of the Antae {{was built}} in the style of Greek houses around the Mediterranean. A two storey house with three wings and a portico of Tuscan columns, built around a small basin of water, fed by {{rainwater}} from the roof, which channelled <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> a cistern, then into the drains which ran under the pavement of the street. It is named after two fluted antae that flank its doorway.|$|E

25|$|Stone aqueducts, {{sometimes}} spanning miles, brought {{fresh water}} from a river or spring to the mission site. Baked clay pipes, joined with lime mortar or bitumen, carried <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> reservoirs and gravity-fed fountains, and emptied into waterways where {{the force of the}} water would be used to turn grinding wheels, presses, and other simple machinery. Water brought to the mission proper would be used for cooking, cleaning, irrigation of crops, and drinking. Drinking water was allowed to trickle through alternate layers of sand and charcoal to remove the impurities.|$|E
25|$|Most of Carlsbad's {{development}} {{was due to}} irrigation water. Local cattleman recognized the value of diverting water from the Pecos River to the grazing lands on Eddy's Halagueno Ranch. Many construction projects were undertaken to establish an irrigation system within the town. The Avalon Dam was constructed upstream of town, and canals diverted <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> town. Conflict arose when the canals met the river downstream; as a result, the Pecos River Flume was built, first out of wood and later concrete (the flume is often titled {{the only place where}} a river crosses itself).|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{filters are}} widely used for {{filtering}} both drinking water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2μm—including giardia and cryptosporidium. Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> a river {{that is used by}} towns further downstream. They {{are widely used}} in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as phosphorus, nitrates and heavy metal ions.|$|E

50|$|Leavenworth built {{a home on}} the Sonoma land in 1849. In 1895, Captain Henry Ernest Boyes and {{his wife}} {{purchased}} the land and house from Leavenworth. Upon hearing about the hot springs that supposedly ran beneath their land, they dug two wells and discovered <b>the</b> thermal mineral <b>water.</b> They installed a pipe system, directing <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>into</b> a huge tub.|$|R

25|$|Heymann {{says most}} of the rooms are {{relatively}} small and have high ceilings. The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another use}} of philodendrons is for {{catching}} fish. A tribe in the Colombian Amazon {{is known to}} use Philodendron craspedodromum to add poison to the water, temporarily stunning the fish, which rise up to the surface, {{where they can be}} easily scooped up. To add the poison to the water, the leaves are cut into pieces and tied together to form bundles, which are allowed to ferment for a few days. The bundles are crushed and added to <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> which the poison will dissipate. Although the toxicity of Philodendron craspedodromum is not fully known, active ingredients in the poisoning of the fish possibly are coumarins formed during the fermentation process.|$|E
25|$|No {{study of}} the {{missions}} is complete without mention of their extensive water supply systems. Stone zanjas (aqueducts, sometimes spanning miles, brought fresh water from a nearby river or spring to the mission site. Open or covered lined ditches and/or baked clay pipes, joined together with lime mortar or bitumen, gravity-fed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> large cisterns and fountains, and emptied into waterways where {{the force of the}} water was used to turn grinding wheels and other simple machinery, or dispensed for use in cleaning. Water used for drinking and cooking was allowed to trickle through alternate layers of sand and charcoal to remove the impurities. One of the best-preserved mission water systems is at Mission Santa Barbara.|$|E

50|$|Under Article 1, the {{boundary}} of Sikkim and Tibet {{was defined as the}} crest of the mountain range separating <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Teesta River in Sikkim and its tributaries from <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan Mochu River and northwards into other rivers of Tibet.

25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Unusually {{for such}} a high fell, the slopes of Raise {{do not have a}} toehold at valley level on either side. In the west the {{boundary}} streams of Sticks Gill (West) and Brund Gill meet just below White Side's Brown Crag. As Fisherplace Gill they descend a further thousand feet to the valley, and originally turned north to join St John's Beck. All of this changed as part of the Thirlmere reservoir scheme in 1894, when a water race was constructed to carry most of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the lake. To the east the fell is also squeezed out at height by its neighbours, failing to reach the shore of Ullswater. Raise has a short eastern ridge, Stang, descending between Sticks Gill (East) and Glenridding Beck, but these streams combine above the site of the old Greenside Mine to leave Sheffield Pike and Birkhouse Moor overlooking Glenridding.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of taking}} the waters from the carrs in the north to a new outlet near Marfleet on the Humber was {{suggested}} by Mr Snow in 1671. He was a Commissioner of Sewers, and proposed a new drain from Forthdike to Marfleet, passing {{to the east of}} Sutton, whose inhabitants had resisted previous attempts at a solution. Snow offered to cut the drain in return for use of the drained land for a period of 21 years, but he failed to obtain the consent of the landowners or an Act of Parliament to authorise it. Sir Joseph Ashe made some improvements to his Wawne estate, which included cutting the Engine Drain, {{at the end of which}} he built two windmills to raise <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the Hull. Others followed suit, and there were around a dozen drainage windmills in the area by the early eighteenth century.|$|E
