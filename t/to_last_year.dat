25|$|On 14 February 2013, the 2013 tournament {{was officially}} announced. It {{featured}} {{exactly the same}} 32 teams from last year, marking {{the first time in}} Nordic/European Trophy history that the teams remained the same from last year. The 32 teams were also divided into exactly the same divisions, and the regulation round schedule (before the playoffs) was similar <b>to</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> the only difference being that the home–away team assignings for each game were switched. Due to the 2014 Winter Olympics, the regulation round ended in September 2013 instead of a spread-out schedule ending in November.|$|E
25|$|The 32 {{teams in}} the tournament were, partly based on {{geographical}} location, divided into four divisions: the West Division, the North Division, the South Division, and the East Division. Each division consisted of 8 teams who played a round-robin in their division, with an extra game against a local rival in their division, giving a total of 8 games per team. Each team was assigned four home games as well as four road games. The match-ups were nearly identical <b>to</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> the only difference being that the home–away team assignings were switched for each game. Six teams qualified for the playoffs: Eisbären Berlin (as host), the winner of each division, and the best 2nd-placed team of all four divisions.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991–92 college {{basketball}} season, Troy State was playing its next <b>to</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> as an NCAA Division II school before transitioning to Division I. They {{were led by}} head coach Don Maestri, whose unconventional offense-oriented system led to incredibly high-scoring games; that season, Troy State led all of DivisionII with a 121.0 points per game scoring average (while also giving up 107.8 per game). They shot an NCAA-record 1,303 three-pointers in 1991–92 and connected on 444 of them. Maestri's philosophy was to unapologetically attempt steals on an opponent's every possession, and if they missed the steal, they allowed the opponent to score {{as long as they}} scored quickly. He substituted players regularly and knew that his track-meet-style of pressure would eventually wear out the other team. Once tired, his Troy State squads would continue to relentlessly pursue opponents on the defensive end; on offense, no shot was considered a bad shot and the quicker the attempt, the better. The high octane offense used by Troy State was modeled after Paul Westhead's Loyola Marymount teams of the era; Maestri even had Westhead mail him Loyola Marymount game tapes to study the plays and methods used by the successful DivisionI school.|$|E
