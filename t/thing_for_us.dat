However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "pussy," [...] among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: [...] "It's a rare <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," [...] ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because [...] "o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given {{that we would be}} running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said." ...|$|E

Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous.

500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

[...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke."

500|$|For Wasting Light, Grohl {{stated that}} they {{would go back to}} a rawer and heavier sound after [...] "exploring new musical ground" [...] on the {{previous}} records, adding that [...] "with the last album we were too concerned with being musical, now it's time for us to be a rock band again". To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49. It's my last chance." [...] While the demos that prompted Grohl to say the album would be their heaviest yet were not used on the album, Vig took the declarations to heart, following three criteria while recording: [...] "It's got to be hooky, heavy, and we're going analog all the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to be on top of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E

2500|$|During that interval, Nae Ionescu and his Cuvântul {{were moving}} to the far right, {{aligning}} themselves with the fascist Iron Guard.

In a December 1933 issue of Credința, he reacted: [...] "We say that democracy is not the good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> yet we have never even truly implemented it". Writing from a Christian perspective, Tudor accused Romania's revolutionary youth of [...] "monkeying" [...] foreign experiments in totalitarianism, describing Adolf Hitler as the Antichrist, and equating all revolutionary ideologies with the triumph of [...] "animality".

Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks.

At The Center for AIDS, a non-profit organization that tries to prevent HIV infection from becoming HIV disease, it’s our job to keep on top of new developments. In fact, that’s most of what we do. We don’t provide social services, counseling, or financial assistance. Instead, we pour over medical journals, Internet sites, and other sources looking for information that can keep people with HIV alive and healthy.
