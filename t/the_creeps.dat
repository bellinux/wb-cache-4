2500|$|Team Liquid {{defeated}} Newbee {{three straight}} {{times in the}} best-of-five series, {{the first time a}} team had been shut out in the International Grand Finals. PC Gamer described Team Liquid's approach as a [...] "dominating snowball style" [...] strategy. One of Liquid's team members would aggressively attack the Newbee base in a sacrificial manner, harming some of their defenses a little at a time. This allowed the CPU-controlled mobs for Team Liquid, known in-game as [...] "creeps", to easily clear through one of the lanes that were no longer defended and harass the opponent's base, requiring Newbee's players to focus more on defending against <b>the</b> <b>creeps</b> than the attacking heroes. Eventually Newbee were overwhelmed and succumbed to Team Liquid's attack. Newbee attempted to adjust their strategy {{at the start of the}} third match by changing their hero drafting picks, but were unable to recover. The third and final match was won by a coordinated effort by Team Liquid's players, using several powerful hero abilities in synergy, to take out all of Newbee's heroes. They then pressed their advantage to advance towards Newbee's base, unable to be stopped, winning the match and therefore the tournament.|$|E

40|$|In this study, DEM {{simulations}} of triaxial creep tests on dense and loose sand samples {{were carried out}} to examine the micromechanics involved during <b>creep.</b> <b>The</b> simulated <b>creep</b> responses reproduce qualitatively the published experimental results. During <b>the</b> primary <b>creep,</b> <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> stress is gradually borne by the contact normal forces instead of contact tangential forces so that the columnar particle structures can be formed. This process also leads to a continuous decrease in <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> rate. <b>The</b> columnar structures eventually are completely formed and <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> rate reaches a minimum. However, the structures become meta-stable and susceptible to buckling. This explains why a sand packing does not show {{an extended period of}} secondary <b>creep</b> in <b>the</b> experiment. Buckling of the columnar structures also gives rise to maximum dilatancy and a sharp transition of the major fabric orientation of weak forces from horizontal to vertical. The continuous buckling process of columnar structures increases <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> rate and sliding ratios of contacts during <b>the</b> tertiary <b>creep.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> trend of contact tangential forces decreasing and contact normal forces increasing is reversed.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the mechanical properties of uncompacted rockfill and <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> deformation behaviour of rockfill under a load as well as finding a suitable method for estimation of creep deformation behaviour, a full scale embankment loading experiment was performed. The results of this experiment were then evaluated. During {{the course of this}} study it became evident to the author that the deformations which were seen in the collected data from the experiment could be classified as creep deformations due to the linear decrease of the deformation against the logarithm of time and the study therefore came to focus on creep. One constitutive equation and one model for estimation of creep deformations were studied, and parameters were obtained through back analysis of experiment data as well as calculation of soil stresses. <b>The</b> <b>creep</b> model was based on a logarithmic approximation of <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> deformations and <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> equation was based on a power function. <b>The</b> <b>creep</b> model could also be simplified and evaluated as an equation and when a comparison was made between the equations and the measured results this showed that the logarithmic equation resulted in estimates closer to the measured deformations than what the power function did, therefore a logarithmic function is a better approximation to the deformations of the rockfill at Norvik than the power function. When <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> model was evaluated as intended, based on the soil stresses, <b>the</b> resulting <b>creep</b> estimates were less accurate, they was however still within the limits of what can be considered as admissible. The conclusion is that a logarithmic function describes <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> deformation of <b>the</b> rockfill at Norvik better than a power function and that <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> model by Kristensen is suitable for estimating <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> deformations.
