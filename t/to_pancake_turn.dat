40|$|The density {{fluctuations}} {{associated with the}} formation of large-scale cosmic pancake-like and filamentary structures are evaluated using the Zel'dovich approximation for the evolution of nonlinear inhomogeneities in the expanding universe. It is shown that the large-scale nonlinear {{density fluctuations}} in the galaxy distribution due <b>to</b> <b>pancakes</b> modify the standard scale-invariant correlation function xi(r) at scales comparable to the coherence length of adiabatic fluctuations. The typical contribution of <b>pancakes</b> and filaments <b>to</b> the J 3 integral, and more generally to the moments of galaxy counts in a volume of approximately (15 - 40 per h Mpc) exp 3, provides a statistical test for the existence of large scale inhomogeneities. An application to several recent three dimensional data sets shows that despite large observational uncertainties over the relevant scales characteristic features may be present that can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>pancakes</b> in most, but not all, of the various galaxy samples...|$|R

The Jif lemon-shaped packaging aligned Jif with the consumption of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday in consumers' minds, creating a strong link between the product and Shrove Tuesday. Jif and pancakes is a popular combination on Shrove Tuesday. In 2000, over 80,000 Jif lemons were being produced per day to meet consumer demand for Pancake Day, beginning five weeks prior <b>to</b> <b>Pancake</b> Day. This occurred despite fresh lemons having greater availability during this time compared to other time periods.|$|R

40|$|We examine vortex {{dynamics}} and pinning in layered superconductors using three-dimensional molecular dyanmics simulations of magnetically interacting pancake vortices. Our model treats the magnetic interactions of the pancakes exactly, with longe-range logarithmic interactions {{both within and}} between planes. At the matching field the vortices are aligned with the pinning array. As a function of tilt angle for the pinning arrays a series of commensuration effects occur, seen as peaks in the critical current, due <b>to</b> <b>pancakes</b> finding a favorable alignment.
