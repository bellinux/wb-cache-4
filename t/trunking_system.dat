5000|$|In <b>trunked</b> <b>systems</b> {{with many}} channels, a site design may include several {{transmit}} antennas to reduce combining network losses. For example, a six-channel <b>trunked</b> <b>system</b> may have two transmit antennas with three transmitters connected {{to each of}} the two transmit antennas. Because small variations affect every antenna, each antenna will have a slightly different directional pattern. Each antenna will interact with the tower and other nearby antennas differently.

50|$|PDT (short for Professional Digital Trunking or Police Digital Trunking) {{is an open}} {{industry}} standard for trunked radio system in China servicing police wireless communications and professional mobile radio. The standard is being maintained by the Professional Digital <b>Trunking</b> <b>System</b> Industry Association, an association of major vendors of wireless communications equipment in China.

5000|$|At {{the time}} in Strowger exchanges ranks of {{selectors}} were interconnected {{by means of a}} complex <b>trunking</b> <b>system</b> dictated by the method of setting up the calls and by the need to economise in the total number of switching points.

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of Type II, the [...] "System ID" [...] was also introduced. This is a four digit identifier unique to each <b>trunking</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose of the System ID is to allow radios to operate only on that specific system, and to identify each system. The System ID also allows for enhanced security because a radio now requires a System Key, unique to the System ID {{in order to be}} programmed onto any given system. Type I systems do not use unique System IDs, thus the possibility exists for overlapping coverage in busy areas.|$|E
