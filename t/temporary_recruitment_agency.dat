Working for <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies</b> includes constant changes of colleagues and places of work {{and at the same}} time one has two different managers. Who does the individual turn to when problems occur and who do the employed see as his/her manager? Why do people search for work in <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies?</b> How does it feel not having a fixed place of work or colleagues and how do the aspects of this affect the employed psychosocial work environment?

They had to be from different ages, genders and come from different ethnical backgrounds and the time of employment had to vary between them all. As earlier researches we discovered some deficiencies within the <b>recruitment</b> <b>agency</b> and particularly about the social relations. Coming to demands our respondents has not expressed any despair. On the other hand there are suggestions that the demands are higher from the customer and the stationary employees, than from the <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies</b> managers. The employed recons they have control over their working situation, based on their right of saying no to assignments that does not appeal them. Earlier research shows that employees within a <b>recruitment</b> <b>agency</b> are employed for an average of two years and that personal turnover is high in this business. Our respondents has worked in this trade of industry for two weeks up to four years and a number of them has been offered stationary employment at customers. All of them have turned them down with the justification about them being comfortable in the <b>recruitment</b> <b>agency</b> business and that the customer has not been appealing.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to integrate analysis through case studies on how knowledge sharing could be implemented successfully. Furthermore, this study also will clarify a conceptualisation that provides a new understanding of the relationship between unemployed graduates and the human capital concept. This paper used web documentation for the research technique, and an interpretive approach was used as the research paradigm. Two online <b>recruitment</b> <b>agency</b> sites were analysed thoroughly, and a qualitative analysis was made on them. The connections show how knowledge sharing {{can be used as a}} medium to help unemployed graduates to get jobs through online <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies.</b> An online <b>recruitment</b> <b>agency</b> can help fresh graduates to find good jobs because most of the agencies have thousands of corporate clients. High quality candidates must have good soft skills, problem-solving skills and employable value-added skills to get the best jobs. This study will look at how far online <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies</b> can better assist new graduates to get the best job for them. The findings will be expressed as qualitative results from the two online <b>recruitment</b> <b>agencies</b> researched as the case studies for the paper.
