5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
25|$|Whereas wides and no {{balls are}} {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bowler, and are considered negative statistics in a bowler's record, byes {{are considered to}} be <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wicket-keeper, and are considered negatively against the wicket-keeper's record. However, some playing conditions make byes more likely, regardless of a wicket-keeper's ability – wayward fast bowling, or an uneven pitch, or the need for the keeper to stand directly behind the stumps.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest {{aftershock}} derived in {{the present}} study is located at <b>the</b> northern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aftershock area within 24 hours after the main shock. If <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest aftershock is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main shock, the Pacific plate must have moved northwestward during the main shock and southeastward during the largest aftershock. This movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific plate seems quite unnatural. Judging from the focal depth and the focal mechanism solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main shock, <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main shock is about 20 km in <b>the</b> epicentral area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest aftershock, while <b>the</b> focal depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest aftershock determined by JMA is 40 km.

25|$|According to the Government Accountability Office, at a 2009 count, {{there was}} a payment error rate of 4.36% of SNAP {{benefits}} down from 9.86% in 1999.

25|$|During sea trials, the {{submarine}} was often forced back to port because of equipment problems, where the Navy personnel found that ASC engineers would diagnose and repair systems {{using a combination}} of supplier data and diagnostic tools not available to the sailors. Problems with the training were compounded by an attitude from ASC that problems were always <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy operators. However, most were the result of equipment failure, and the problems caused by operator error could be attributed to poor training or a lack of training, both of which were the responsibility of ASC.|$|E
25|$|Raglan {{was blamed}} {{by the press}} and the {{government}} for the sufferings of the British soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter during the Siege of Sevastopol owing to shortages of food and clothing although this, in part, was <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home authorities who failed to provide adequate logistical support. A piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol on 18 June 1855 was a complete failure. The anxieties of the siege began to seriously undermine Raglan's health and he died from a mixture of dysentery and clinical depression on 28 June 1855. His body was brought home and interred at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton.|$|E
25|$|When a No ball is bowled, runs {{are awarded}} to the batting team. Under the Laws of Cricket a one run penalty is awarded. In Test cricket and One Day International cricket the award is also one run; in some {{domestic}} competitions, particularly one-day cricket competitions, the award is two runs. All such penalty runs are scored as extras and {{are added to the}} batting team's total, but are not added to any batsman's total. For scoring, No balls are considered to be <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bowler (even if the infringement was committed by a fielder), and since the early 1980s, are recorded as a negative statistic in a bowler's record.|$|E

25|$|The 100th accident, {{as defined}} by METRO, {{occurred}} on August 10, 2005. In the judgement of METRO police only two of these were <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train operator.

Following the Texas A report METRO implemented four-way red lights at some crossings and other safety measures {{which led to a}} 75% reduction in incidents per train mile even as service ramped up. Critics have also noted the fact that the system is at-grade, while supporters contend that lack of federal funding due to political opposition made construction of a grade separated rail line unfeasible. Sociology and urban studies professor Stephen Klineberg argues that the high rate of crashes in Houston is attributable to the high rate of automobile driving and low rate of walking in Houston.|$|E
