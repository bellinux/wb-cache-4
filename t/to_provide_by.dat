25|$|Texas {{remained}} largely rural until World War II though {{the success of}} the petroleum industry rapidly expanded the economy with heavy industry of many types taking root. The second world war created tremendous demand for petroleum and a variety of products that Texas was in a unique position <b>to</b> <b>provide.</b> <b>By</b> {{the end of the war}} Texas was one of the leading industrial states and the population had become predominantly urban. Additionally the economy had diversified sufficiently that, though petroleum was still the largest sector by the end of the war, the business community in the state was truly diverse.|$|E

500|$|An {{analysis}} in Kirkus Reviews, noting {{the choice of}} title by the author, asserted that Pressman: [...] "makes no pretense to objectivity here." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticized the book, saying [...] "What the author dramatically fails <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>by</b> bearing down on the negative (to the extent that nearly all his informants denounce est and its founder) is any real understanding of est's teachings--and of why they appealed so deeply to so many." [...] Paul S. Boyer, {{professor of history at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, reviewed the book in The Washington Post. Boyer wrote that the book [...] "nicely recounts the bizarre tale" [...] of Werner Erhard, saying [...] "Pressman tells his fascinating story well." [...] However he also commented that the book gives [...] "only the sketchiest historical context" [...] of est and its roots in societal experiences.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{mention of}} a public {{university}} in Texas {{can be traced to}} the 1827 constitution for the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. Although Title 6, Article 217 of the Constitution promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Texas Congress adopted the Constitution of the Republic, which, under Section 5 of its General Provisions, stated [...] "It shall be the duty of Congress, as soon as circumstances will permit, <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>by</b> law, a general system of education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Headwear is an {{important}} component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear will vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution's specifications. [...] For caps, the mortarboard is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown. [...] The exception—velvet—is reserved for the doctor's degree only, seen {{in the form of a}} multiple-sided (4, 6, or 8) [...] tam, but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here. [...] The only colour called for is black, in all cases. [...] The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>by</b> tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress. [...] It has been black, or represented the university's colours, or the colours of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national honour societies or other awards. There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind. [...] For doctoral and masters students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.|$|E

60|$|I {{am happy}} to {{announce}} the passage of an act by the General Cortes of Portugal, proclaimed since the adjournment of Congress, for the abolition of servitude in the Portuguese colonies. It is to be hoped that such legislation may be another step toward the great consummation to be reached, when no man shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, under any guise, excuse, or form of law, to hold his fellow-man in bondage. I am of opinion also {{that it is the}} duty of the United States, as contributing toward that end, and required by the spirit of the age in which we live, <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>by</b> suitable legislation that no citizen of the United States shall hold slaves as property in any other country or be interested therein.|$|E
60|$|The {{power of}} the Bishop of Liege for their defence {{was not to be}} questioned, since his ecclesiastical dignity gave him the means of {{protecting}} the fugitives against all Christian Princes; while, on the other hand, his secular forces, if not numerous, seemed at least sufficient to defend his person, and all under his protection, from any sudden violence. The difficulty was to reach the little Court of the Bishop in safety; but for this Louis promised <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>by</b> spreading a report that the Ladies of Croye had escaped from Tours by night, under fear of being delivered up to the Burgundian Envoy, and had taken their flight towards Bretagne. He also promised them the attendance of a small but faithful retinue, and letters to the commanders of such towns and fortresses as they might pass, with instructions to use every means for protecting and assisting them in their journey.|$|E
60|$|The post-office in the States is also {{burdened}} by another terrible political evil, which {{in itself is}} so heavy that one would at first sight declare it {{to be enough to}} prevent anything like efficiency. The whole of its staff is removable every fourth year--that is to say, on the election of every new President; and a very large proportion of its staff is thus removed periodically to make way for those for whom a new President is bound <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>by</b> reason of their services in sending him to the White House. They have served him, and he thus repays them by this use of his patronage in their favor. At four hundred and thirty-four post-offices in the States-- those being the offices to which the highest salaries are attached-- the President has this power, and exercises it as a matter of course. He has the same power with reference, I believe, to all the appointments held in the post-office at Washington. This practice applies by no means to the post-office only. All the government clerks--clerks employed by the central government at Washington--are subject to the same rule. And the rule has also been adopted in the various States with reference to State offices.|$|E

60|$|In {{spite of}} the nominal {{equality}} of income, A, an annuitant of £1,000 a year, can not so well afford to pay £100 out of it as B, who derives the same annual sum from heritable property; A having usually a demand on his income which B has not, namely, <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>by</b> saving for children or others; to which, {{in the case of}} salaries or professional gains, must generally be added a provision for his own later years; while B may expend his whole income without injury to his old age, and still have it all to bestow on others after his death. If A, in order to meet these exigencies, must lay by £300 of his income, to take £100 from him as income-tax is to take £100 from £700, since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption. Were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves, abating £70 from his consumption and £30 from his annual saving, then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as B’s; but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax. The capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less, and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with income-tax; while B’s heirs would only be charged once.|$|E
60|$|But {{through these}} years, {{throughout}} constant care and unrelaxed activity {{of mind and}} body, his heart was aching for the wife he {{had no time to}} mourn; and the agony thus suppressed led to an utter loathing for all that he thought held him back from perfect likeness to the glorified Saint whom he loved. He took delight in the most spiritual mystical writings he could find,--a Kempis, Madame Guyon, Fenelon, and the like,--and endeavoured to fulfil the Gospel measure of holiness. He gave up his whole patrimony to the American Baptist Mission Board (now separate from England and Serampore), mortified to the very utmost his fastidious delicacy by ministering to the most loathsome diseases; and to crush his love of honour, he burnt a letter of thanks for his services from the Governor-General of India, and other documents of the same kind. He fasted severely, and having by nature a peculiar horror of the decay and mouldering of death, he deemed it pride and self-love, and dug a grave beside which he would sit meditating on the appearance of the body after death. He had a bamboo hermitage on the borders of the jungle, where he would live on rice for weeks together--only holding converse with those who came to him for religious instruction; and once, when worn out with his work of translation, he went far into the depths of the wildest jungle, near a deserted pagoda, and there sat down to read, pray, and meditate. The next day, on returning to the spot, he found a seat of bamboo, and the branches woven together for a shelter. Judson never learnt whose work this was, but it was done by a loving disciple, who had overcome the fear of tigers <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>by</b> night for his comfort, though the place was thought so dangerous that his safety, during the forty days that he haunted it, was viewed by the natives as a miracle. He spent several months in retirement. It was indeed four years after his bereavement, but it is plain that he was taking the needful rest and calm that his whole nature required after the shock that he had undergone, but which he had in a manner deferred until the numbers of workers were so increased that his constant labour could be dispensed with. He came forth from his retirement renovated in spirit, for the second period of his toils.|$|E
