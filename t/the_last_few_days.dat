5|$|The {{event was}} recounted in Dexter Masters' 1955 novel The Accident, a fictional account of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> {{of the life}} of a nuclear {{scientist}} suffering from radiation poisoning. Depictions of the criticality incident include the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, in which John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman based on Slotin, and the Louis Slotin Sonata, a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P.

He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, when Palin and the BBC were {{planning}} {{to make a new}} travel programme, Pole to Pole, they decided {{that it would be a}} good idea to have a full-time stills photographer on the team, and that Pao was a top candidate for the job. Pao accepted, and, except for the very first <b>few</b> <b>days</b> and <b>the</b> very <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> (he missed out on the two poles due to lack of space in the small aircraft used at both ends of the trip) it was exclusively his pictures that were used in the follow-on book that Palin wrote, Pole to Pole with Michael Palin.|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of Poe's life {{comes from his}} attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral {{at the back of}} Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps {{its way to the}} sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the war was of little significance.|$|E
50|$|Masopust and {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> {{of this period}} (fašank, končiny) was an official holiday of feasting {{for people in the}} past. During these days people were supposed to eat one’s fill, therefore, huge dinner parties were held. Then, the forty days long Lent followed and mostly lentils, baked potatoes, eggs, cheese, and boiled semolina were consumed.|$|R
5000|$|From {{captured}} Japanese records <b>the</b> submarines <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> can be pieced together. Heading {{home through}} the East China Sea after attacking convoy Hi-40 on 24 February, Grayback used her last two torpedoes to sink the freighter Ceylon Maru on 27 February. That same day, a Japanese carrier-based plane spotted a submarine {{on the surface}} in the East China Sea and attacked. According to Japanese reports the submarine [...] "exploded and sank immediately," [...] but antisubmarine craft were called in to depth-charge the area, clearly marked by a trail of air bubbles, until at last a heavy oil slick swelled to the surface. Grayback had ended her last patrol, one which cost the enemy some 21,594 tons of shipping.|$|R

5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|In orbit, the Enterprise {{crew and}} Jameson beam {{down into the}} tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was {{anticipated}} and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise, where they discover Jameson was not shot but instead the reverse aging drug is destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} young man is Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after which Jameson reveals a scar on his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> {{had been}} {{monotonous}} and Finucane {{was eager to}} fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E

5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E

Many studies have been the car- ried out in air monitoring in urban areas while the targeted surveys to assess the impact on air quality of snow disper- sion for ski activities are rare. Thanks to the Autonomous Province of Trento it has been possible to sample the snow- pack in some ski areas in Italy and thanks to stratigraphic profiles it has been possible to observe variations of the chemical composition over time. Natural contribution is strictly related to winds and currents movement, for this reason a deep knowledge of these factors can help in the determination of the prevalent trajectories during the year [7, 8]. Dur- ing a penetrometeric and stratigraphic profile on Presena glacier, the main nivo-meteorological features, air temperature and temperature inside the different layers of the snowpack have been measured. Some snow samples has been col- lected and analyzed by SEM-EDS, ICP-MS and IC.
