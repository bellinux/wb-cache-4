Many of these buildings fail to comply with the current building regulations regarding the energy consumption. In this study, the possibility for upgrading a hypothetical apartment building with an oil-based heating system has been investigated employing simulations from the IDA Indoor Climate and Energy software. For the construction of the original building, customs and regulations from the period 1981 - 90 were employed, and the building envelope was upgraded to the requirements of the Norwegian research centre on Zero Emission Buildings. Two <b>alternative</b> <b>heating</b> systems have been investigated: solar thermal collectors (i) alone and (ii) as combined with borehole thermal storage and a ground-source heat pump. For each case, the energy consumption, thermal comfort and indoor climate were studied. The simulations predict a reduction in the total annual heat demand to one third of the original with the upgrading. For <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>heating</b> systems, with solar collectors alone the demand for additional electric heating was still considerable, however in the combined system it was negligible.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} small {{heat shock}} protein IbpA protects client proteins from aggregation. Due to redundancy in the cellular chaperone network, deletion of the ibpA gene often leads to only a mild or no phenotypic defect. In this study, we show that a Pseudomonas putida ibpA deletion mutant has a severe growth defect under heat stress conditions and reduced survival during recovery revealing a critical role of IbpA in heat tolerance. Transcription of the ibpA gene depends on <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>heat</b> shock sigma factor s 32. Production of IbpA protein only at heat shock temperatures suggested additional translational control. We conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 59 untranslated regions of the ibpA genes from P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both contain a ROSE-type RNA thermometer that is substantially shorter and simpler than previously reported ROSE elements. Comprised of two hairpin structures only, they inhibit translation at low temperature and permit translation initiation after a temperature upshift. Both elements regulate reporter gene expression in Escherichia coli and ribosome binding in vitro in a temperature-dependent manner. Structure probing revealed local melting of the second hairpin whereas the first hairpin remained unaffected.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate life cycle impacts of buildings, integrating climate change (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 IPCC scenarios) and evolution of the energy mix on the long term (at 2050). Two methodological approaches were developed following the modelling principles of attributional and consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). The methodology is illustrated using a simple case study: a low-energy single family house located in France. Two design options were evaluated using life cycle assessment: the choice of a heating system and the integration of photovoltaic (PV) modules on the roof. Using an attributional approach and compared to a static LCA considering no prospective parameters, the carbon footprint of the house (total life cycle) varies from + 21 % to + 43 % for <b>the</b> electric <b>heating</b> <b>alternative,</b> − 7 % to + 4 % for <b>the</b> gas boiler <b>alternative,</b> − 6 % to + 15 % for <b>the</b> PV <b>alternative</b> depending on climate change intensity and evolution of the energy mix.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{planning}} of rational heating systems for urban areas. From the sustainability viewpoint, district heating is an important option to supply heat to the users in urban areas. The energy convenience of such option depends on the annual energy request, the population density and the efficiency in <b>heat</b> production. Among <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> technologies, geothermal <b>heat</b> pumps (both open loop and closed loop heat pumps) play a crucial role. This paper aims to propose a procedure to select which users in an urban area should be connected with a district heating network and which ones should be <b>heated</b> through an <b>alternative</b> technology, in order to reach a globally optimal system from the energy viewpoint. The procedure proposes district heating as the initial choice for all the users. The users are then progressively disconnected to the network, according with the primary energy required to supply them <b>heat,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> technology is considered for disconnected users. Here, ground water heat pump is considered as <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> technology. <b>The</b> total primary energy request is assumed as the objective function to be minimized. To reach this result, the exergetic cost of heat supplied through heat pumps system must be evaluated. Such evaluation is not trivial, as it must include proper analysis of both the district <b>heating</b> network and <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> system. In <b>the</b> case of densely populated areas, an additional consideration is necessary: the subsurface thermal degradation caused by heat pump installations may affect the performances of surrounding installations. This impact is calculated through a thermo-fluid dynamic model of the subsurface. The application to an Italian town is considered as a test case. The optimal configuration of the overall urban heating system is obtained. This configuration corresponds to the minimum primary energy request to supply heat to all the users (those connected to the network and those using an <b>alternative</b> <b>heating</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{accurately}} predict heat transfer in aircraft anti-icing systems or in turbomachinery cooling passages is a current topic of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In both applications, the flow structure is highly complex and three-dimensional. The traditional use of correlations {{might be useful}} in describing the average heat transfer behavior, but not the localized effects. Accurate heat transfer predictions are required to design efficient complex cooling or <b>heating</b> <b>schemes</b> and only a full 3 D Navier-Stokes code, coupled with a solid conduction code, is <b>the</b> sole <b>alternative.</b> Conjugate <b>Heat</b> Transfer (CHT) is the commonly used term to identify such coupling of convection and conduction across one or several fluid-solid interfaces.

The algorithm supports 3 D structured, unstructured, and hybrid meshes, with mismatched node connectivity and with non-uniform grid densities between fluid and solid domains at CHT interfaces.

There is no indication on what to expect in the future with regard to electricity tariffs. Many South Africans are searching for ways to save on their monthly electricity bills by seeking out <b>alternative</b> water <b>heating</b> systems. Solar geysers became a popular investment option, but this might not be the best options available on the market. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the most financially viable investment option in order to reduce electricity cost when it comes to water heating systems for use in households. This is done by comparing the capital expenditure and operational cost needed with the financial benefits generated by the investment, taking into consideration the size of the household. Design and method: A literature study was done on <b>the</b> different <b>alternative</b> water <b>heating</b> systems in order to obtain a better understanding of how these systems operate and what savings they can generate. Different investment appraisals were identified and a literature review was performed in order to identify the most appropriate investment appraisals for the purpose of this study. It was found that the net present value, equivalent annual annuity, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, accounting rate of return, discounted payback period and the economic value added were the best investment appraisal methods to use for the purpose of this study. Findings and conclusion: It was found that the five investment options identified in the literature review would all, to some extent, be financially viable to implement within households with high as well as low volume hot water consumption. All the investment appraisals gave positive outcomes. The conclusion was made that a saving will be generated on the monthly electricity bill no matter what <b>alternative</b> water <b>heating</b> system were to be installed in the place of a conventional geyser. Recommendations: It is recommended that a household with low volume hot water consumption should install a time switch as this investment option renders the highest IRR, MIRR, ARR and discounted payback period. The second best investment option for a household with low volume hot water consumption is a heat pump and the third best option is a gas geyser. For a household with high volume hot water consumption, the best investment options is again a time switch, as this renders the best IRR, MIRR, ARR and discounted payback period. The second best investment option is a heat pump, with a gas geyser as the third best investment option. Value of the research: This study focuses on five <b>alternative</b> water <b>heating</b> systems for a household within South Africa in times where electricity charges sharply increase. The financial viability of each of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> is determined through various investment appraisals and the best option can be identified by comparing the outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Furthermore, each individual is able to determine the viability of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> by using <b>the</b> Excel model attached to this study and by inputting his/her own variables, where applicable. Research limitation: Limited literature was available on <b>the</b> different <b>alternative</b> water <b>heating</b> systems. No indication could be found of the maintenance cost of the different water heating systems. Assumptions had to be made with regard to households, although no two households are the same. Areas for further research: The same study could be performed, but with the focus on small businesses and large organisations. Furthermore, a study could be performed to determine the appropriate discount rate for individuals as well as the maintenance cost for water heating systems. Master...|$|R
