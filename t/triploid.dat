50|$|The {{nature of}} the black carp's diet has led to its use in the United States in the control of snails in aquaculture. Snails are obligate {{alternate}} hosts of trematode pests that can cause substantial losses to aquaculture crops. Some state aquaculture laws require the carp to be bred as <b>triploids,</b> to render them sterile, thus minimizing {{the potential for the}} fish to escape and create self-sustaining populations. However, the use of <b>triploids</b> does require the maintenance and use of fertile diploid brood stock at least at some location, for production of the <b>triploids.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background X {{chromosome}} inactivation (XCI) is {{that aspect}} of mammalian dosage compensation that brings about equivalence of X-linked gene expression between females and males by inactivating {{one of the two}} X chromosomes (Xi) in normal female cells, leaving them with a single active X (Xa) as in male cells. In cells with more than two X's, but a diploid autosomal complement, all X's but one, Xa, are inactivated. This phenomenon is commonly thought to suggest 1) that normal development requires a ratio of one Xa per diploid autosomal set, and 2) that an early event in XCI is the marking of one X to be active, with remaining X's becoming inactivated by default. Results <b>Triploids</b> provide a test of these ideas because the ratio of one Xa per diploid autosomal set cannot be achieved, yet this abnormal ratio should not necessarily affect the one-Xa choice mechanism for XCI. Previous studies of XCI patterns in murine <b>triploids</b> support the single-Xa model, but human <b>triploids</b> mostly have two-Xa cells, whether they are XXX or XXY. The XCI patterns we observe in fibroblast cultures from different XXX human <b>triploids</b> suggest that the two-Xa pattern of XCI is selected for, and may have resulted from rare segregation errors or Xi reactivation. Conclusion The initial X inactivation pattern in human <b>triploids,</b> therefore, is likely to resemble the pattern that predominates in murine <b>triploids,</b> i. e., a single Xa, with the remaining X's inactive. Furthermore, our studies of XIST RNA accumulation and promoter methylation suggest that the basic features of XCI are normal in <b>triploids</b> despite the abnormal X:autosome ratio. </p...|$|R
5|$|The <b>triploid</b> {{onion is}} a hybrid species with {{three sets of}} chromosomes, two sets from A. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. Various clones of the <b>triploid</b> onion are grown locally in {{different}} regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' is grown extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a monophyletic origin for this species.|$|E

Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile <b>triploid</b> hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless <b>triploid</b> hybrid. Common dandelion is a <b>triploid</b> that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} ploidy on the {{mortality}} of Crassostrea gigas spat {{caused by the}} ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV- 1) genotype μVar was investigated at five sites along the Atlantic coast in France in 2011. Sibling diploids and <b>triploids</b> were produced using either unselected or selected OsHV- 1 -resistant oysters. No significant interactions {{were found between the}} factors of environment, genotype and ploidy at the endpoint dates. The mean mortality rates at the sites were 62 and 59 % for diploids and <b>triploids,</b> respectively, and the two rates were not significantly different. The mean mortality rates were 33 and 32 % for sibling diploids and <b>triploids,</b> respectively, when OsHV- 1 -resistant parents were used, and 91 and 85 %, respectively, when unselected parents were used. The results were confirmed through other broodstocks tested in 2013. Our study is the first to clearly show that mortality related to OsHV- 1 is similar between diploids and <b>triploids</b> in C. gigas when the same germplasm is used for both ploidy. Furthermore, OsHV- 1 resistance was not substantially altered by triploidization, indicating that the achieved selective breeding of diploid oysters for OsHV- 1 resistance can be translated into improved survival in <b>triploids...</b>|$|R

5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. <b>Triploid</b> bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E

5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), {{with three}} connate (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). There {{is a single}} style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a <b>triploid</b> nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E

40|$|Although {{triploidy}} induction is {{a reliable}} method for producing sterile fish for aquaculture and fisheries management, {{little is known}} about how triploidy influences nutrition and bioenergetics of fish. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether triploidy affects nutrient uptake and body composition in fish, using juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as the test species and varying the levels of dietary phosphorus. Triplicate groups of sibling <b>triploids</b> and diploids (45. g initial weight) were fed isocaloric diets with 0. 76, 0. 99 and 1. 39 % total phosphorus in a 12 -week growth trial, followed by a feed digestibility trial with diets having 0. 67, 0. 93 and 1. 15 % total phosphorus. <b>Triploids</b> had a higher growth rate and lower condition factor than diploids during the growth trial, with no difference in feed conversion ratio. Whole-body lipid and energy levels, as well as nitrogen and energy efficiency ratios, were higher in the <b>triploids,</b> but ash and moisture levels were lower. <b>Triploids</b> initially had lower plasma phosphorus levels than diploids, but on the final sampling day there was no difference between ploidies in levels of plasma phosphorus, bone ash and phosphorus within the bone ash. Apparent digestibility coefficients for phosphorus, ash and dry matter were not significantly different between <b>triploids</b> and diploids.

This paper describes a rapid and simple method for triploidy determination from the larval stage of turbot (Scopthalmus maximus) by flow cytometry.

5|$|The {{allotetraploid}} hybrid species {{derived from}} A.montanum can backcross with A.montanum to form <b>triploid</b> hybrids. The backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum is A.×trudellii, {{as suggested by}} Wherry. He also collected specimens of the backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi). The sterile diploid A.montanum × platyneuron, precursor to A.bradleyi, was collected in 1972 at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia; A.montanum × rhizophyllum, precursor to A.pinnatifidum, has never been found.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D.

He also made chromosome counts of A.×trudellii, which had been classified by some simply as a variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between them would be a <b>triploid,</b> and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that both A.bradleyi and A.pinnatifidum were allotetraploids, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and another Asplenium to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile <b>triploid</b> that reproduces asexually, {{producing}} many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being <b>triploid,</b> are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E

The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (<b>triploid</b> or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
