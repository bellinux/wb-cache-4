In spite of the commonalties, SIT strongly differs from TRIZ in several important respects, having to do mainly with its practical application.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} {{how to use}} innovative techniques to improve the decision-making process in crisis response organizations. The focus was on building situation awareness of a crisis and overcoming pitfalls such as tunnel vision and information bias through using critical thinking. We started by observing typical difficulties in crisis management in a field study. The essential elements of concern were a deficit in sharing and communicating understanding and a patchy overview of the topics communicated, within {{as well as between}} teams. Communication frequently did not entail the reasoning behind a decision that was made. We therefore developed a critical <b>thinking</b> <b>tool</b> that made the reasoning process more explicit {{and at the same time}} more robust by tying it to specific hypotheses. We studied a candidate support tool in a controlled setting and found that people made better judgments, particularly in situations where they would be prone to decision biases. We subsequently extended the critical <b>thinking</b> <b>tool</b> to a team setting. We list a number of requirements that are essential for support systems that intend to limit tunnel vision and alleviate communication and coordination problems in crisis response organiza...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTraditional {{education}} systems {{need to be}} replaced by critical educational systems. A critical education system can be developed using “system thinking” tools. We propose here an “engaged knowledge constellation” framework as a system <b>thinking</b> <b>tool.</b> Evidence is provided from literature on the subject and lessons learned while implementing system thinking during the last decade in the university where the author is affiliated. If such a tool is used as a guide during the “education pathway” of the individual, learning will become a source of enjoyment rather than pain. An appropriate “learning environment” will definitely enhance the educational process...|$|R

The text of the interview is subsequently analyzed and scored to give a series of mathematical indicators.|$|E
5000|$|Person centred {{thinking}} was first {{developed by a}} group of people practicing Essential Lifestyle Planning in the US (now known as 'The Learning Community for Person Centred Practices). These planners realised that while many plans were being written, many of these were not leading to real change in peoples lives. This group decided that person centred planning was something {{a small group of people}} needed to know, but that for planning to work, a much wider group of people need skills around listening for what's important to people and how to best support people. Michael Smull who is a leading figure in this group describes Person centred thinking as [...] "something that virtually everyone who touches a person needs to know" [...] because change was most powerful when all staff were using person centred <b>thinking</b> <b>tools</b> in their roles, rather than relying solely on person centred planning facilitators to create plans. To enable these tools to be shared at scale, Essential Lifestyle Planning was 'deconstructed' into a range of person centred <b>thinking</b> <b>tools,</b> that enable staff to participate with the person in a cycle of listening, learning and action by building up a set of tools recording this process to form a person centred description of the person.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the Japanese notion of koto, focusing especially {{on how it}} can be useful in thinking about education. One meaning of koto is simply “thing”, but there is a deeper nuance with no direct equivalent in English. Koto can simultaneously encompass and relate the concrete world of “objects” to the abstract realm of “thoughts” and “feelings”. We use examples from real life to demonstrate the koto mindset. Two stories in particular will be valuable: one from the silicon spheres being made in Australia for the Avogadro project and another from the history of shawl-making by peasants in Slovakia. These examples will introduce the <b>thinking</b> <b>tool</b> of the “koto wedge”...|$|R
