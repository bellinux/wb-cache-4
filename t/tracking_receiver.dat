40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} {{investigation}} is {{the search for}} new analysis methods of tonal track circuits, the definition of signal waveform at the <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> input. Methodology. The method of frequency characteristics was used for investigation of transient processes. Signal spectrum at the output of track generator was determined using fast Fourier transform. Signal spectrum at the input of <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> was calculated after determining complex frequency characteristic of the tonal track circuit. To carry out such calculations the frequency characteristics of rail line parameters have been obtained resulting interpolation of reference data and the frequency characteristic of <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> impedance has been calculated. To determine the signal time dependence at the input of <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> the inverse fast Fourier transform was applied. Findings. The causes of signal distortion in the tonal track circuits have been clarified. Track filter and input filter of <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> restrict upper and lower sidebands of the signal spectrum, which leads to prolonging {{the rise and fall}} of signal pulses. The rail line, cable lines, and the devices for protection and alignment do not affect the shape of signal pulses, and change only their amplitude. At influence of rise and fall of signal pulses in the connected RLC circuits of receiver arise free oscillations at the resonance frequencies. As a result of the interference of these oscillations occur beats and appears additional pulse. Originality. The method for the analysis of tonal track circuits has been improved that allows determining not only the level but also the time dependence of signal at the <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> for any input action. Practical value. Obtained time dependence of signal at the <b>track</b> <b>receiver</b> input will be useful in the development of the new more perfect methods for determining the state of tonal track circuit. Proposed method of track circuit analysis may be used to search for new more informative form of signal current...|$|R

50|$|A solar bowl {{is a type}} {{of solar}} thermal {{collector}} that operates similarly to a parabolic dish, but instead of using a tracking parabolic mirror with a fixed receiver, it has a fixed spherical mirror with a <b>tracking</b> <b>receiver.</b> This reduces efficiency, but makes it cheaper to build and operate.

The main reason for its development was to eliminate the cost of moving a large mirror to track the sun as with parabolic dish systems.|$|E
5000|$|When flown competitively, {{the usual}} aim is maximum flight duration. In {{the case of}} models flown outdoors, the modeler {{attempts}} to launch the model into rising column of air, a thermal. These outdoor free flight models tend to be designed for two very different flying modes: climbing rapidly under power or tow, and gliding slowly while circling with minimum fall rate. Much of the challenge in designing and flying these models is to maintain aerodynamic stability in both modes {{and to make a}} smooth transition between them. Modern models use mechanical or electronic timers to move control surfaces at preset times. Detecting the thermal into which to launch is vital and can involve several methods, ranging from radio telemetered temperature and windspeed measurements plotted on a chart recorder to Mylar streamers or soap bubbles to visualize the rising air.Because competitions normally involve up to seven rounds during the day, each flown to a maximum flight time hard to achieve without thermal assistance; an automatic on-board timeswitch upsets the trim of the aircraft when the [...] "max" [...] is achieved, to bring the aircraft down safely and quickly. Locating and recovering the aircraft for further flights {{is an important part of}} free-flight. Many aircraft carry radio location beacons, and flyers will use GPS, binoculars, a compass and a directionally sensitive radio <b>tracking</b> <b>receiver</b> to assist them. A day's flying and retrieval may well involve 20 mi or so on foot or on bike, depending on wind strength.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{selection}} of the Intermediate Frequency (IF) bandwidth filter for a data receiver for processing PCM data is based on using a peak deviation of 0. 35 times the bit rate. The optimum IF bandwidth filter {{is equal to the}} bit rate. An IF bandwidth filter of 1. 5 times the bit rate degrades the data by approximately 0. 7 dB. The {{selection of}} the IF bandwidth filter for tracking receivers is based on the narrowest “noise bandwidth” that will yield the best system sensitivity. In some cases the noise bandwidth of the <b>tracking</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is the same as the}} IF bandwidth of the data receiver because it is the same receiver. If this is the case, the PCM bit rate determines the IF bandwidth and establishes the system sensitivity. With increasing bit rates and increased transmitter stability characteristics, the IF bandwidth filter selection criteria for a <b>tracking</b> <b>receiver</b> must include system sensitivity considerations. The <b>tracking</b> <b>receiver</b> IF bandwidth filter selection criteria should also be based on the narrowest IF bandwidth that will not cause the tracking errors to be masked by high bit rates and alter the pedestal dynamic response.
