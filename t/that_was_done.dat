5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by himself.|$|E
5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field survey <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the Saudi Arabian coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E

5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

A special edition VHS and DVD of the film was released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2003. The fourth DVD release and first Blu-ray Disc release (the second Blu-ray in the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series) was released on March 10, 2009. Like the 2008 Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray release, the Pinocchio Blu-ray package featured a new restoration by Lowry Digital in a two-disc Blu-ray set, with a bonus DVD version of the film also included. This set returned to the Disney Vault on April 30, 2011. A Signature Edition was released on Digital HD on January 10, 2017 and was followed by a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on January 31, 2017.|$|E

25|$|The {{wood was}} likely much larger originally, as extracting iron from its ore {{required}} great quantities of charcoal.

The ore also needed to be crushed, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in appropriate mills. Lastly, extracting iron required air to activate the bloomeries and the site is at the top of a hill, well exposed to winds.|$|E

25|$|Al-Muwaffaq {{eventually}} {{departed from}} Tustar {{and proceeded to}} 'Askar Mukram, and from there {{he made his way}} to Suq al-Ahwaz. While there, he discovered that the Zanj had mined a nearby bridge which prevented supplies from reaching the city, so he ordered his men to restore the crossing. Once <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> he remained in the city for several days in order to strengthen his forces. During this time, the Zanj who had deserted 'Ali wrote to him requesting a pardon; al-Muwaffaq granted this, and about one thousand of 'Ali's men were integrated into his army.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculptures of}} the Last Judgement {{were the only}} statues in the Minster to survive the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. The 47 large {{free-standing}} statues are replicas (the originals are in the Bern History Museum), and the 170 smaller figures are all original. The Last Judgement {{was the work of}} one sculptor, Erhard Küng from Stadtlohn, Westphalia, which gives the collection a unity of design. The Justice sculpture is the only one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by another artist. It is signed by Daniel Heintz, who was the master builder after 1571. The rest of the statues were carved some time between 1460 and 1501, most likely between 1460 and 1480.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1541 Cranmer {{revealed}} {{these matters}} {{in a letter}} to the King. The King immediately ordered that the Queen be confined to her apartments, and never saw her again. The Dowager Duchess, hearing reports of what had happened while Catherine had been under her lax guardianship, reasoned that 'If there be none offence sithence the marriage, she cannot die for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> before'. Unfortunately for the Queen and the Dowager Duchess, further investigations by Cranmer and the Council revealed that with the connivance of one of her attendants, Lady Rochford, Catherine had allegedly had an affair with Thomas Culpeper, one of the King's favourite gentlemen of the privy chamber, after her marriage to the King.|$|E
25|$|The Army and Navy had {{distinct}} but not incompatible {{reasons to}} get their forces {{to the east of}} Vicksburg. Grant wanted to get his soldiers onto dry ground with no rivers between him and the Confederate defense. Once <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> he believed that he could flank Pemberton's Confederate army. At the same time, he could divert a part of the expedition up the Yalobusha River to destroy a railroad bridge that was enabling the enemy to threaten his own line of communications. Porter's purpose was to use his armored gunboats to destroy Rebel shipping at Yazoo City. He emphasized that any enemy ironclads must be destroyed, if possible on the stocks. Although the two services had divergent goals, this did not affect the expedition adversely; its ultimate failure is ascribed to other causes.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{establishment}} of the Oregon and California trails and Mormon settlement, Indians native to the Salt Lake Valley and adjacent areas lived by hunting buffalo and other game, but also gathered grass seed from the bountiful grass of the area as well as roots {{such as those of}} the Indian Camas. By the time of settlement, indeed before 1840, the buffalo were gone from the valley, but hunting by settlers and grazing of cattle severely impacted the Indians in the area, and as settlement expanded into nearby river valleys and oases, indigenous tribes experienced increasing difficulty in gathering sufficient food. Brigham Young's counsel was to feed the hungry tribes, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> but it was often not enough. These tensions formed the background to the Bear River massacre committed by California Militia stationed in Salt Lake City during the Civil War. The site of the massacre is just inside Preston, Idaho, but was generally thought to be within Utah at the time.|$|E
25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us. The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Houston got {{the ball}} first and on their opening play, they lost three yards on a screen pass. Once <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> quarterback Warren Moon got them rolling {{all the way to}} the end zone. Despite two fumbled snaps on the drive, he {{completed}} 8/10 passes for 64 yards, including a 24-yarder to Haywood Jeffires, on a 16-play, 80-yard drive that took 9:14 off the clock and ended with his 5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ernest Givins. New York had to punt on their first possession, but {{got the ball}} back with great field position when defensive back Erik McMillan intercepted Moon's pass on the Oilers 39-yard line. The Jets then cashed in on their opportunity with a 9-play drive to score on Ken O'Brien's 10-yard touchdown pass to Al Toon, who made an athletic catch in the back of the end zone while barely managing to keep his feet in bounds. Later on, Houston defensive back Bo Orlando intercepted a long pass from O'Brien on the Oilers 25, and Moon led the team to a touchdown from there, completing passes to Drew Hill and Givins for 20 and 35 yards before Givins' 20-yard touchdown reception made the score 14–7 with 3:56 left in the half. New York ended up punting, but at the 1:10 mark, Houston's Al Del Greco missed a 46-yard field goal wide right. O'Brien then completed a pair of passes to Toon for 36 total yards on a drive to the Oilers 16-yard line where Raul Allegre kicked a 33-yard field goal to cut the score to 14–10 going into halftime.|$|E
