Solomon Meredith enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.|$|E
5|$|Beecher's Handmade Cheese is an artisan cheesemaker {{and retail}} shop with {{locations}} in <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> Place Market, Seattle, Washington and New York City's Flatiron District. The company {{was founded by}} Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003 and opened in <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> Place Market after Dammeier obtained a difficult to obtain storefront lease in the Market. Because Dammeier {{had never been a}} cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|South of <b>the</b> <b>pike,</b> Archer's {{men were}} expecting an easy fight against {{dismounted}} cavalrymen and were astonished {{to recognize the}} black Hardee hats worn by the men facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, {{had a reputation as}} fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of <b>the</b> <b>pike.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pike</b> Place Market store now sells roughly thirty-five {{other local}} artisan cheese brands, in {{addition}} to the various Beecher's products. <b>The</b> <b>Pike</b> Place Market location also offers classes to the public about cheese making, cheese history, and the pairing of wine with cheese. The collection of Pacific Northwest cheeses on sale at the retail store has been described as the best in the entire region by Will O'Donnell in Northwest Magazine. In keeping with Dammeier's idea that his cheese business should encourage the growth of the artisan cheese businesses in the area, the Beecher's retail store makes special efforts to feature and sell cheeses from new and small Northwest cheesemakers. The Flatiron location incorporates the Northwest influence its cheesecase, but carries a significant number of Northeast artisanal cheeses.|$|E

5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting.

5000|$|... ==Origin== <b>The</b> <b>Pikes</b> Peak granite was emplaced {{in three}} major {{intrusive}} {{events in the}} southern Front Range, now exposed in Colorado's Lost Creek Wilderness, Buffalo Peaks Wilderness, and Pikes Peak.

Both the batholith and <b>the</b> <b>Pikes</b> Peak granite are A-type, meaning granites that originate in anorogenic, or non mountain building, tectonic settings, with an alkaline geochemistry and arising from more anhydrous magmas.|$|R
5|$|Lumber {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. The PhiladelphiaErie Pike (present day Pennsylvania Route 504) opened the Black Moshannon area to settlers by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes Tavern along <b>the</b> <b>Pike,</b> trapped fur-bearing animals, and cleared land for farming.|$|E
5|$|Now {{north of}} Windsor Airport, the route crosses over the Canadian Pacific Windsor Subdivision {{just west of}} a partial {{interchange}} with Jefferson Boulevard, which provides westbound access to and eastbound access from the expressway. The route passes south of the Ford Essex Engine Plant before meeting the Lauzon Parkway at an interchange. It crosses Little River before entering an area with a subdivision {{to the north and}} a commercial park to the south. The commercial zoning eventually transitions to agricultural fields, and the E. C. Row Expressway curves northeast and intersects Banwell Road at-grade. East of Banwell Road, the road continues as <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> Creek Bypass, former Highway2.|$|E
5|$|The morning {{infantry}} fighting {{occurred on}} either side of the Chambersburg Pike, mostly on McPherson Ridge. To the north, an unfinished railroad bed opened three shallow cuts in the ridges. To the south, the dominant features were Willoughby Run and Herbst Woods (sometimes called McPherson Woods, but they were the property of John Herbst). Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's Union brigade opposed Davis's brigade; three of Cutler's regiments were north of <b>the</b> <b>Pike,</b> two to the south. To the left of Cutler, Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's Iron Brigade opposed Archer.|$|E

5|$|This {{judgement}} did {{not remove}} {{the potential for}} disputes, as ice could be washed downstream along rivers, resulting in arguments over the ownership of the displaced ice. In some states it was made illegal to damage the uncut ice belonging to another businessman, but arguments could still become nasty. In the winter of 1900‚Äì01, for example, disputes between <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and Cartage Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games {{were held}} in Seattle. News crews at <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> Place Market {{discovered}} the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on Good Morning America, leading to the business and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front {{of as many as}} 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they could get into {{position}} on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped {{the right of}} Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men. Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of <b>the</b> <b>pike.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service, feudal obligations and money contracts of bonds of manrent. In 1513 these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but there is evidence that by the mid-sixteenth century the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign and noblemen became indistinguishable from the majority of troops. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the plaid. Weapons included various forms of axes and pole arms. Highland troops brought bows and two-handed swords (claidheamh m√≥r). The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. <b>The</b> <b>pike</b> began to replace the spear or axe and the bow began to be replaced by gunpowder firearms. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies and the Scots fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the borders. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a gun foundry in 1511. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture from the mid-fifteenth century. In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles.|$|E

In {{preparation}} for utility relocation work on Pine Street, Metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east‚Äìwest streets in February 1987. On April 27, excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of Pine Street, and its offramp to Interstate 5, to automobile traffic between 3rd Avenue and Boren Avenue. Workers finished digging in late August, allowing the project to progress to concrete pouring for the roadway. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the Christmas shopping season beginning November 1 {{at the request of}} downtown merchants, with a temporary surface laid over backfill for automobiles and pedestrians. On January 4, the street was closed to automobile traffic once again, along with the intersection of 5th Avenue and Pine Street and <b>the</b> <b>Pike</b> Street offramp of I-5, to install utility lines and a permanent roadway. Pine Street was fully reopened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the completion of Westlake Park and the Westlake Center shopping mall, a year ahead of schedule.|$|E
