40|$|Massive scale {{plantation}} forestry in Myanmar {{began in}} the early 1980 s as a drastic measure to fulfil the increasing demand for timber and to prevent the conversion of deteriorated forestland to agricultural land. Myanmar Forest Department is recruiting shifting cultivators, establishing plantation villages and applying the <b>taungya</b> <b>method</b> in establishing teak plantations. From the very beginning, there was an argument about whether the project is creating forest protective groups or forest destructive groups. A key determinant to that question from the researcher point of view is the socio-economic situations; knowing the present situation of the plantation villagers can help to understand the forest management practices. Interview surveys were carried out in three villages in Bago Yoma, the main region of the special teak plantation program, to examine the current economic benefits to plantation villagers. Questions were designed mainly to explore the incentives for people participation and the socio-economic situations of the plantation villagers. Principal component analysis was used to analyze the collected data. It was found that local people are willing to participate in the initial establishment of plantations. However, all the incentives relating to the project are temporary, with no long-term consideration for taungya farmers, which jeopardizes the plan to create forest protective groups. It is concluded {{that the time has come}} for the Myanmar Forest Department to change its main aim of earning foreign exchange from establishment of teak plantations through the <b>taungya</b> <b>method</b> to redressing deforestation through people participation based on rural socio-economic development...|$|E

One {{example of this}} is the dominant understanding of the unfolding of Taungya farming in Southern Nigeria in recent decades. An agro-forestry method of afforestation introduced by the colonial Forest Department in the 1920 s and widespread by the 1960 s, it is now perceived as a means of destroying the forest. Indeed, whilst reserve land continues to be allocated for Taungya farming, today, due to the Forest Department's political and economic difficulties, no more trees are planted. But this does not necessarily constitute a political and environmental crisis. Through an ethnographic and historical study of Taungya farming in the Okomu Reserve in Edo State, this article shows not only that there were always problems with <b>Taungya</b> as a <b>method</b> of afforestation, but also that its recent transformation may be seen as quite successful, both socially and environmentally. In this way, the article challenges both the ‘crisis’ perception of Taungya farming today and conventional ideas about what constitutes proper management and mismanagemen...|$|R
