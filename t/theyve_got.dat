5000|$|Dookie was {{released}} to critical acclaim. Bill Lamb at About.com regards {{it as an}} album that only gets better with time, calling it [...] "one of the landmark albums of the 1990s". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Dookie as [...] "a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered". In 1994, Time claimed Dookie as the third best album of the year, and the best rock album of 1994. Jon Pareles from The New York Times, in early 1995, described the sound of Dookie as, [...] "Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate." [...] Rolling Stones Paul Evans described Green Day as [...] "convincing mainly because <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> punks snotty anti-values down cold: blame, self-pity, arrogant self-hatred, humor, narcissism, fun".|$|E

And {{there were other people}} in Guns n Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesnt feel right in any way. I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. Its not an Axl Rose album, even if its what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> into singing and building. Maybe Im helping steer it to what it should be built like." [...] Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to drug addictions and an effort from inside the band to destroy him, stating [...] "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," [...] and that he [...] "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described the dissolution as [...] "a divorce".|$|E
5000|$|Below Stairs {{was one of}} a wave {{of working-class}} memoirs {{beginning}} in the 1950s, and is about class—she writes, [...] "We always called them Them"— but [...] "defiantly individualistic" [...] rather than socialist. Powell is bitter about the injustice of her situation, [...] "very good at dramatising ... mortifying moments", and [...] "throws the last shovel of dirt on the myth of the devoted help and their unfailing love and respect for the stately home". The book [...] "prompted a storm of hurt letters". However, she has no time for politics and instead focusses on beating the odds: [...] "Those people who say the rich should share what <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> are talking a lot of my eye and Betty Martin; its only because they havent got it they think that way ... If I had it Id hang on to it too". The Wall Street Journals reviewer in 2012 called her [...] "admirably feisty" [...] and [...] "wittily scathing of the class-bound cant conditioning Britain {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century".|$|E
5000|$|Slobodan Antonić of Nova srpska politička misao {{summarized}} E-novine in June 2009 as [...] "the Other Serbias tabloid whose online pieces {{have one}} purpose and one purpose only — to stimulate its readers salivary glands {{to the point}} where they can, by repeatedly spitting out their contempt all over the comments section, advance the narrative of Serbia being an evil and fascist country". He then pointed out E-novines 21 June 2009 piece headlined [...] "Čik progovori mađarski u Srbiji" [...] — about two men who allege to have been approached and assaulted in a Novi Sad city transit bus by a random passenger, allegedly just for having spoken Hungarian during the ride — while specifically focusing on the pieces comment section featuring published reader reaction such as: [...] "You dont fight Serbs with words, you fight them with weapons. Shoot first, ask questions later. There will be no peace as long as theres a single Serb walking the Balkans and the world. My deepest sympathies for the brave Hungarian lads, but <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> no one to blame but themselves. From 1992 onward they should have refused the mandatory military service in the Chetnik army; by now they could have had a real guerrilla army that could have been attacking police stations, blowing up bridges, and preparing the liberation of Vojvodina from Serb occupation". All comments as well as the original piece were taken down by E-novine after Antonićs criticism.|$|E
5000|$|October {{began with}} a 2-1 defeat at Cardiff City. Lita neatly touched Elliotts free kick home, but Cardiffs goals came from {{defensive}} errors: Packwood played them onside for the first, and failure {{to deal with a}} corner allowed Mark Hudson to score the winner. New loanee James Hurst made his debut as a second-half substitute. Courtesy of half-price ticket offers, more than 18,000 saw Birmingham lose 1-0 to Huddersfield Town; Žigić was sent off for a high tackle and Mitch Hancox made his competitive debut as substitute for the injured Davies. Clark accused the players of failing to take responsibility, making it clear that he was [...] "not sitting in the dressing room telling them not to tackle, to pussyfoot around, telling them to mis-place passes. They cant just hide behind me all the time, <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> to come out fighting." [...] Butland produced what he described as the best performance of his career and Ravel Morrison, selected {{for the first time since}} August after problems with his attitude to training led Clark to consider terminating his loan, was influential as Birmingham narrowly failed to beat league leaders Leicester City. Away to Millwall, Birmingham went 3-0 down in a seven-minute spell in the first half, two of the three scored by former loanee Chris Wood, before Marlon King scored the first hat-trick of his senior career to secure the draw. On his 40th birthday, Lee Clark selected the same starting eleven away at Leeds United, where Lita scored the only goal of the game from 30 yd.|$|E
5000|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised the Chili Peppers for not overpowering the listener with heavy metal guitar riffs as their previous album had. Rolling Stones Tom Moon credited Rick Rubin {{for the change}} in style; Rubin [...] "gave the Chilis dynamic." [...] He went on to praise the overall sound, which [...] "displayed a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic said the album was [...] "The Red Hot Chili Peppers best album ... John Frusciantes guitar is less overpoweringly noisy, leaving room for differing textures and clearer lines, while the band overall is more focused and less indulgent." [...] He considered Blood Sugar to be [...] "varying ... it expands the groups musical and emotional range." [...] Guitar Player magazine credited Frusciante with the Chili Peppers drastic change in style: [...] "by blending acid-rock, soul-funk, early art-rock, and blues style with a raw, unprocessed Strat-and-Marshall tone, Frusciante hit on an explosive formula {{that has yet to}} be duplicated." [...] Devon Powters of PopMatters said that [...] "in one funked-out, fucked up, diabolical swoop, Blood Sugar Sex Magik reconfigured my relationship to music, to myself, to my culture and identity, to my race and class." [...] In an article published in The Tampa Tribune, editor Philip Booth praised the record as [...] "an ambitious effort that amounts to a culmination and blossoming of the musical forces that have been brewing in the bands sound since Kiedis and Flea birthed the band in 1983." [...] Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his Village Voice consumer guide, naming [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Breaking the Girl" [...] as highlights while writing [...] "theyve grown up, theyve learned to write, <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> a right to be sex mystiks." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Michael Corcoran was more reserved in his praise, deeming the record [...] "great" [...] only on occasion while finding the length of the album excessive. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is considered to be an influential album, throughout the nineties, by establishing itself as a fundamental foundation for alternative rock. It has also been referred to as [...] "the cornerstone album of funk rock" [...] by FasterLouder.|$|E
5000|$|Livingstone had {{no control}} over {{government}} policy regarding immigration, which had resulted in a significant growth in foreign arrivals coming to London during his administration; from 2000 to 2005 Londons population grew by 200,000 to reach 7.5 million. He didnt oppose this, encouraging racial equality and celebrating the citys multiculturalism. Livingstone condemned the UKs involvement in the Iraq War and involved himself in the Stop the War campaign. In November 2003, he made headlines for referring to US President George W. Bush as [...] "the greatest threat to life on this planet," [...] just before Bushs official visit to the UK. Livingstone also organised an alternative [...] "Peace Reception" [...] at City Hall [...] "for everybody who is not George Bush," [...] with anti-war Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic as the guest of honour. [...] Livingstones success with the congestion charge and rejuvenation of Trafalgar Square led the Labour leadership to reconsider their position on him, with Blair re-admitting him to the party and asking that he stand as their Mayoral candidate for the 2004 election. Livingstone eagerly agreed, and Labour Mayoral candidate Nicky Gavron volunteered to take a subordinate position as his deputy. In campaigning for the election, Livingstone highlighted his record: the congestion charge, free bus travel for under 11s, 1000 extra buses, and 5000 extra police officers, whereas his main competitor, the Conservative Steve Norris, campaigned primarily on a policy of abolishing the congestion charge. Livingstone continued to court controversy throughout the campaign; in June 2004 he was quoted on The Guardians website as saying: [...] "I just long for the day I wake up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp-posts and <b>theyve</b> <b>got</b> a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia", for which he was widely criticised. That same month he came under criticism from sectors of the left for urging RMT members to cross picket lines in a proposed Underground strike because the latest offer had been [...] "extremely generous", leading RMT general secretary Bob Crow to step down as a TfL board member. In the London mayoral election, 2004, Livingstone was announced as the winner on 10 June 2004. He won 36% of first preference votes to Norriss 28% and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughess 15%. When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted, Livingstone won with 55% to Norriss 45%.|$|E
40|$|In a {{knowledge}} society, what?s needed {{is an open}} innovation network, argues JOHN HARTLEY THERE has been much comment recently on Kevin Rudd?s proposal to fast-track broadband infrastructure in Australia. Even the government thinks {{this is a good}} idea. The only difference between the parties is whether it should be supported with public as well as private finance. Not much of the debate has been concerned with what Australians might do with their digital capability once <b>they?ve</b> <b>got</b> it. Even less thought seems to have gone into how they ? or rather we ? will acquire the skills and motivations required to benefit fully from this new toy. Political attention is focused on publishers and providers not consumers and users. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were notable for massive and sustained public investment in schools and (later on) universities ? the infrastructure needed to deliver near-universal print-literacy at low cost to the user. Right around the world the cost was justified in order to produce modern citizens and a disciplined, skilled workforce for industrialisation. That effort has not been matched in the digital era. The physical ICT infrastructure that has developed since the 1990 s has not been matched by a concomitant investment in education ? public or private ? to promote creative uptake of digital technologies by entire populations. Usage across different demographics is patchy to say the least, continuing to reproduce the class and demographic divides inherited from the industrial era. The scaling up of digital literacy is left largely to entertainment providers and those who want users for their proprietary software applications. In other words, the market. But what about the intended beneficiaries of party-political competition and education policy; young people especially? If we?re to believe what we read about Generation Y and ?digital natives,? they are already in evolutionary mid-step. Today?s 13 -year-olds ? those who?ll be retiring from work around the year 2060 ? seem almost a different species from modernists reared in the image of industry. Teens evidently don?t see computers as technology. It?s as if they?re born with an innate ability for text-messaging and gaming. And while {{they may not be able}} to spell they can tell you their life story on MySpace, entertain you on YouTube, muse philosophically in the blogosphere, contribute to knowledge on Wikipedia, create cutting-edge art on Flickr. If they?re anything like my daughter they can do most of these things at once, and then submit their efforts to an online ethic of collective intelligence (via msn, SMS) and iterative improvability that is surely scientific in mode. But they learn very little of this in school. For the most part the education system has responded to the digital era by prohibiting school-based access to digital environments, apart from walled gardens under strict teacher control. From this, kids also learn that formal education?s top priority is not to make them digitally literate but to ?protect? them from ?inappropriate? content and online predators. So a good many of them switch off, and devote their energies to daydreaming and making mischief. And there?s the rub. Daydreaming is just another word for identity-formation using individual imagination. Mischief is no more than experimental engagement with peer-groups and places. Teenage daydreaming and mischief have been the wellspring of the entertainment industry from time immemorial, supplying the characters, actions and plots of fantasy fiction from A Midsummer Night?s Dream to I Know What You Did Last Summer. Popular culture has prospered by capturing the attention, mood, time, activities and culture of young people in their leisure moments, just beyond the institutional grasp of family, school or work. So while schools and universities keep their distance, purposeless entertainment has nurtured demand for creative self-expression and communication among the young. Until recently, that demand has been provided on a take-it-or-leave-it basis by experts and corporations with little input (apart from cash) by the consumers themselves. But now, with digital online media, there?s almost infinite scope for DIY (do-it-yourself) creative content produced by and for consumers and users, without the need for institutional filtering or control bureaucracies. The so-called ?long tail? of self-made content is accessible to anyone near a computer terminal. Everyone is a potential publisher. Instead of needing to rely on the expertise of others, young people navigate themselves through this universe of information. Although schools and universities certainly teach ?ICT skills? and even ?creative practice,? so far they have not proven to be adept at enabling demand-driven and distributed learning networks for imaginative rather than instrumental purposes. Here is where creative innovation must be nurtured. But it needn?t stop there. There are already loftier ambitions for scientific, intellectual and public uses of the net, but this time such initiatives can include everyone, not just expert elites, which is why ?everyone? needs to be emancipated into digital citizenship. Recently both business and public-service thinking have stressed the need for organisations, governments and communities to evolve models of innovation that go beyond the closed expert process of the industrial era. In {{a knowledge}} society, what?s needed is an open innovation network. At the same time, the intuitive and imaginative skills of entrepreneurs have been compared with those of artists. The need for creativity in all aspects of economic and political life has been recognised. Creative talent now commands economic as well as symbolic value. But an open innovation network ? and therefore an internationally competitive Australian innovation system ? would benefit from harnessing the creative energies of the whole population, not just those of isolated expert elites. ?
