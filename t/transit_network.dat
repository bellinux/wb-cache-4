5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and <b>transit</b> <b>network.</b> The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient rail <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E
5|$|Bus {{transport}} {{across the}} country is widespread; major companies include National Express, Arriva and Go-Ahead Group. The red double-decker buses in London have {{become a symbol of}} England. There is a rapid <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> in two English cities: the London Underground; and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland. There are several tram networks, such as the Blackpool tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro, and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.|$|E
40|$|Design and {{operation}} of <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> is usually based on a deterministic point of view. All types of input {{are assumed to be}} known exactly and to be constant over time. These are clearly unrealistic assumptions since in reality transit demand and supply vary within time. Variations in the demand and the supply pattern are causes of service performance variations for travellers and operators in <b>transit</b> <b>networks.</b> Given variations and distortions in all layers of <b>transit</b> <b>networks,</b> in this paper we {{take a close look at}} suitable methods at different levels of network planning to mitigate disturbances in <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> and consequently to improve service reliability. The main focus is on methods applicable at strategic and tactical levels of transit planning for enhancing transit system resilience. ...|$|R

5|$|The Forward Thrust plan of {{the late}} 1960s {{proposed}} building a four-line rapid <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> using $385 million in local funding to augment a larger federal contribution. One of the proposed lines, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Lake City, included a station adjacent to Roosevelt High School at Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 65th Street.

5|$|Currently under {{construction}} are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate {{as part of}} the new urban rapid <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus. The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with Downtown Amman at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.|$|E

A large initiative to expand the GO <b>Transit</b> <b>network</b> in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Oslo had a rapid <b>transit</b> <b>network</b> that {{branched}} out north-east and north-west {{from the city}} centre. In 1987, the western and eastern network were connected, and through-trains started operating between the two networks from 1993. Plans to make a second connection through the borough of Nordre Aker were launched by politicians in the 1980s. It was argued that this was cheaper than building roads, with the per-kilometre price being {{about a quarter of}} that for motorways. Some politicians also saw the Ring Line as an opportunity to close all parts of the Oslo Tramway, except the Ekeberg- and Lilleaker Line. Oslo Sporveier, the contemporary operator of the metro, started planning the line during the late 1980s. The plans would take advantage of the Gjøvik Line's right-of-way between Storo and Sinsen, while the section from Storo to Tåsen would have to be built in a tunnel.|$|E

40|$|The Cloud {{infrastructure}} {{has become}} an ideal platform for large-scale applications, such as Video-on-Demand (VoD). As VoD systems migrate to the Cloud, new challenges emerge. The complexity of the Cloud system due to virtualization and resource sharing complicates the Quality of Experience (QoE) management. Operational failures in the Cloud can lead to session crashes. In addition to the Cloud, {{there are many other}} systems involved in the large-scale video streaming. These systems include the Content Delivery <b>Networks</b> (CDNs), multiple <b>transit</b> <b>networks,</b> access networks, and user devices. Anomalies in any of these systems can affect users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Identifying the anomalous system that causes QoE degradation is challenging for VoD providers due to their limited visibility over these systems. We propose to apply end user QoE in the management and control of large-scale VoD systems in the Cloud. We present a QoE-based management and control systems and validate them in production Clouds. QMan, a QoE based Management system for VoD in the Cloud, controls the server selection adaptively based on user QoE. QWatch, a scalable monitoring system, detects and locates anomalies based on the end-user QoE. QRank, a scalable anomaly identification system, identifies the anomalous systems causing QoE anomalies. The proposed systems are developed and evaluated in production Clouds (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service). QMan provides 30 % more users with QoE above the “good” Mean Opinion Score (MOS) than existing server selection systems. QMan discovers operational failures by QoE based server monitoring and prevents streaming session crashes. QWatch effectively detects and locates QoE anomalies in our extensive experiments in production Clouds. We find numerous false positives and false negatives when system metric based anomaly detection methods are used. QRank identifies anomalous systems causing 99. 98 % of all QoE anomalies among <b>transit</b> <b>networks,</b> access networks and user devices. Our extensive experiments in production Clouds show that <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> are the most common bottleneck causing QoE anomalies. Cloud provider should identify bottleneck <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> and determine appropriate peering with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to bypass these bottlenecks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Internetworking {{the mobile}} ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) with the Internet {{has been a}} hot issue for many years. However, most researches have been concentrated {{on the use of}} MANETs as the access networks for the Internet. This paper introduces another use of MANETs: backup or load-balancing <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> for the Internet. Although the MANETs capacity is currently low compared with other backbone technologies, we argue that MANETs is a suitable alternative for backup or load-balancing <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> of the Internet based on its self-organized infrastructure-less multi-hop architecture and its increasing capacity in the near future. To provide the backup or load-balancing transit services for the Internet, a scalable, stable, lowoverhead, QoS-support ad-hoc routing architecture with the address auto-configuration is required.

40|$|In {{the paper}} by Cominetti and Correa (2001) [Common-lines and {{passenger}} assignment in congested <b>transit</b> <b>networks.</b> Transportation Science 35 (3), pp 250 - 267], an extension to the common-lines problem for general multidestination networks under congestion is analyzed. Their transit equilibrium assignment model {{allows for a}} full representation of congestion effects caused by the variation of effective frequencies experienced by passengers at transit stops. This model {{is the first to}} address these characteristics consistently with the concept of strategies. In a subsequent paper by Cepeda et al. (2006) [Cepeda, M., Cominetti, and R. Florian, M. (2006) A frequency-based assignment model for congested <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> with strict capacity constraints: characterization and computation of equilibria. Trans.

In this paper, a reformulation of this congested transit equilibrium assignment model is performed, demonstrating that the problem can be expressed as an equivalent variational inequality. The case of strictly capacitated <b>transit</b> <b>networks</b> is explored under the scope of this new reformulation, and new, broader conditions for the existence of solutions to this congested transit assignment model are determined.
