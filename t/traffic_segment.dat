Thirty participants (male & female) completed a simulated drive that comprised a rural highway which was divided into low and high <b>traffic</b> <b>segments.</b> In the driving scenario, a range of measures including speed maintenance, sign detection and hazard reaction were collected.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we present a}} new object based {{hierarchical}} model for joint probabilistic extraction of vehicles and coherent vehicle groups - called traffic segments - in airborne and terrestrial LIDAR point clouds collected from crowded urban areas. Firstly, the 3 D point set is segmented into terrain, vehicle, roof, vegetation and clutter classes.

In the obtained 2 D class and intensity maps we approximate the top view projections of vehicles by rectangles. Since our tasks are simultaneously the extraction of the rectangle population which describes the position, size and orientation of the vehicles and grouping the vehicles into the traffic segments, we propose a hierarchical, Two-Level Marked Point Process (L 2 MPP) model for the problem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new object based {{hierarchical}} model for joint probabilistic extraction of vehicles and groups of corresponding vehicles - called traffic segments - in airborne Lidar point clouds collected from dense urban areas. Firstly, the 3 -D point set is classified into terrain, vehicle, roof, vegetation and clutter classes. Then the points with the corresponding class labels and echo strength (i. e. intensity) values are projected to the ground. In the obtained 2 -D class and intensity maps we approximate the top view projections of vehicles by rectangles. Since our tasks are simultaneously the extraction of the rectangle population which describes the position, size and orientation of the vehicles and grouping the vehicles into the traffic segments, we propose a hierarchical, Two-Level Marked Point Process (L 2 MPP) model for the problem. The output vehicle and <b>traffic</b> <b>segment</b> configurations are extracted by an iterative stochastic optimization algorithm. We have tested the proposed method with real data of a discrete return Lidar sensor providing up to four range measurements for each laser pulse. Using manually annotated Ground Truth information on a data set containing 1009 vehicles, we provide quantitative evaluation results showing that the L 2 MPP model surpasses two earlier grid-based approaches, a 3 -D point-cloud-based process and a single layer MPP solution.

40|$|Improving the {{knowledge}} of demand evolution over time is a key aspect {{in the evaluation of}} transport policies and in forecasting future investment needs, specially critical for the case of toll roads. However, literature regarding demand elasticity estimates in toll roads is sparse and leaves some important aspects to be analyzed in greater detail. In particular, previous research does not focus on heavy vehicle demand, so that the specific behavioral patterns of this <b>traffic</b> <b>segment</b> are not taken into account. Furthermore, GDP is the main socioeconomic variable most commonly chosen to explain road freight traffic growth over time. This paper seeks to determine the variables that better explain the evolution of heavy vehicle demand in toll roads over time. To that end, we present a dynamic panel data methodology aimed at identifying the key socioeconomic variables that explain the behavior of road freight traffic throughout the years. The results show that, despite the usual practice, GDP may not constitute a suitable explanatory variable for heavy vehicle demand. Rather, considering only the GDP of those sectors with a high impact on transport demand, such as construction or industry, leads to more consistent results. The methodology is applied to Spanish toll roads for the 1990 - 2011 period. This is an interesting case in the international context, as road freight demand has experienced an even greater reduction in Spain than elsewhere, {{since the beginning of the}} economic crisis...|$|E

40|$|Several {{airports}} {{in the world}} are or will be confronted with capacity problems in the near future. As a result of this congestion, many airports will face a selectivity problem: which <b>traffic</b> <b>segments</b> must be accommodated and which segments are less crucial? At hub airports there is generally one (dominant) hub carrier. In case particular operations of a hub carrier will cease to exist, this may have negative effects on other operations in the carrier’s network: operations which are normally fed by the ceased operation will experience a loss of passengers. This phenomenon can be indicated as ‘reduction of hub sustainability’. To quantify the effect of ‘reduction of hub sustainability’, SEO/AAE has developed a model, which determines the revenue loss in a hub carrier’s network in case certain operations of the hub carrier will cease to exist. The model assumes that the hub carrier has three instruments to mitigate the described negative effects and to keep load factors above the critical level: ticket price, flight frequency and aircraft size...|$|R

Centralised processing is not then the right choice in such cases. In this paper we develop a parallelised Gaus-sian Mixture Model filter (GMMF) for traffic networks aimed to: 1) work with high amounts of data and heterogenous data (from different sensor modalities), 2) provide robustness {{in the presence of}} sparse and missing sensor data, 3) able to incorporate dif-ferent models in different <b>traffic</b> <b>segments</b> and represent various traffic regimes, 4) able to cope with multimodalities (e. g., due to multimodal measurement likelihood or mul-timodal state probability density functions). The efficiency of the parallelised GMMF is investigated over traffic flows based on macroscopic modelling and compared with a centralised GMMF. The proposed GMM approach is general, it is applicable to systems where the overall state vector can be partitioned into state components (subsets), corresponding to certain geographical regions, such that most of the interactions take place within the subsets. The performance of the paralellised and centralised GMMFs is investigated and evaluated in terms of accuracy and complexity...|$|R
