5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> more speakers of English who acquire English {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

25|$|Cartan's {{approach}} {{seems at}} first to be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, it is not, and the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames, Cartan connection applications and Einstein–Cartan theory for some examples.|$|E

25|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi {{are most}} frequent in plants growing on mineral soils, and are of extreme importance for plants growing in nutrient-deficient substrates {{such as in}} volcanic soil and sand dune environments. The populations of AM fungi is greatest in plant communities with high diversity such as tropical rainforests and temperate grasslands where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> potential host plants and {{can take advantage of}} their ability to colonize a broad host range. There is a lower incidence of mycorrhizal colonization in very arid or nutrient-rich soils. Mycorrhizas have been observed in aquatic habitats; however, waterlogged soils have been shown to decrease colonization in some species.|$|E
25|$|Crocodile size, morphology, {{behaviour}} {{and ecology}} differ somewhat among species. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> similarities {{in these areas}} as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators, {{are very sensitive to}} cold. They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the wines}} {{produced}} under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable {{amount of the}} area's most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used {{in the production of}} Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers are experimenting with reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from basic nouveau table wines, full-bodied red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling spumante. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their sour cherry flavor. While full-bodied recioto and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15–16%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11%. For wines labeled Valpolicella Superiore the wines must be aged a minimum of one year in wood and reach a minimum alcohol level of 12%.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} {{stages in the}} wasp's colony cycle are labeled and separated by emergence. The pre-emergence stage refers to when {{there are not many}} wasp larvae present in the nest. The post-emergence stage is when a colony grows from an increase in larvae population. There is a higher rate of egg-laying and greater number of pupae developing at this phase. According to Noll (1995), the post-swarming stage is when immature wasps are in the mother nest, after the production of sexed individuals and swarming. A small number of old queens and males may also be present at this time. Colonies produce swarms when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> laying queens; they produce new queens when there is only one queen left in the colony. The number of males produced by queens is lower compared to the number of males produced during swarms. However, colonies that produce swarms also produce males. Swarm queens and swarm workers are produced at different points in the queen cycle, with workers being produced after new queens become reproductive on the parental colony.|$|E
25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and are able to do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} {{live in the}} open water, so unlike {{demersal}} or reef fish, they cannot hide among kelp, or in crevices in coral, or under rocks on the bottom. This leaves them vulnerable to attack by large predatory fish, {{as well as other}} predators, such as marine mammals and seabirds. As a result, small pelagic fish usually aggregate in schools for protection. Schooling fish have evolved sophisticated evasion techniques. When they school, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> eyes, making ambush difficult; and their silvery bodies dazzle, making it difficult for predators to pick out individual fish. They react to movements from a predator with lightning reflexes, rhythmically streaming up and down with rapid direction changes. When a predator approaches, they can split and reform behind the predator. During the final stages of an attack, they can explosively disband in all directions and then just as rapidly reform. Defensive manoeuvres like these appear to be choreographed, though they are not. Within the school itself, there is no centralized intelligence aware of how the school has configured itself. Rather, the schooling behaviour is the emergent consequence of relatively simple rules followed by each individual fish in the school, such as remaining close together, moving in the same direction, and avoiding collisions with each other.|$|E
