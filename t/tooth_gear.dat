5000|$|A gearbox {{designed}} using a worm and worm-wheel {{is considerably}} smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90° to each other.With a single start worm, for each 360° {{turn of the}} worm, the worm-gear advances only one tooth of the gear. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the [...] "size of the worm gear - to - 1".Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm gear reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 <b>tooth</b> <b>gear</b> {{to achieve the same}} 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 <b>tooth</b> <b>gear</b> to that of the 20 <b>tooth</b> <b>gear,</b> the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.|$|E

The original differential had a 28 <b>tooth</b> bevel <b>gear,</b> {{designed to be}} meshed with the 14 <b>tooth</b> bevel <b>gears</b> (replaced by the 12 <b>tooth</b> <b>gears)</b> to give 2:1 reduction.

40|$|Abstract. The {{drive of}} the {{transport}} machine in extreme conditions should provide high reliability and durability. For this purpose the <b>tooth</b> <b>gearing</b> should have constant gearing of cogwheels. In {{a number of}} patents transmission {{in the form of}} the hydraulic converter and not switched <b>tooth</b> <b>gearing</b> is presented. However the hydraulic converter considerably complicates transfer and reduces its reliability. Transmission of extreme transport technique should have a simple design and control and to meet extreme requirements. It is expedient to use not switched adaptive <b>tooth</b> <b>gearing</b> based on a phenomenon of mechanical power adaptation. The present work is devoted working out and a theoretical substantiation of effective adaptive transmission for the transport technique working in extreme conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a complete system of inspection and quality control of manufactured parts requires the coordination {{of a set of}} complex processes allowing data acquisition, their dimensional evaluation and their comparison with a reference model. By definition, the parts inspection is the comparison between measurement results and the theoretical surfaces definition in order to check the conformity after manufacturing phase. The automation of this function is currently based on alignment methods of measured points resulting from an acquisition process and these nominal surfaces, {{in a way that they}} ''fit best''. The distances between nominal surface and measured points (i. e. form defects) calculated after alignment stages are necessary for the correction of the manufacturing parameters (Henke, Summerhays, Baldwin, Cassou, & Brown, 1999).

40|$|Improving the {{availability}} of wind turbines (WT) is critical to minimize the cost of wind energy, especially for offshore installations. As gearbox downtime has {{a significant impact on}} WT availabilities, the development of reliable and cost-effective gearbox condition monitoring systems (CMS) is of great concern to the wind industry. Timely detection and diagnosis of developing gear defects within a gearbox {{is an essential part of}} minimizing unplanned downtime of wind turbines. Monitoring signals from WT gearboxes are highly non-stationary as turbine load and speed vary continuously with time. Time-consuming and costly manual handling of large amounts of monitoring data represent one of the main limitations of most current CMSs, so automated algorithms are required.

40|$|Condition based {{monitoring}} (CBM) is {{a subset}} of structural health monitoring (SHM) that is focused on monitoring vibration signals generated by rotating machines in situ and processing the data by various techniques designed to extract damage-sensitive features {{as a means of}} performing damage (e. g., bearing and gear failure) presence, location, or extent. To date, a wide variety of CBM techniques have been documented in the literature and are well accepted in the CBM community. The literature provides current technical means for extracting damage features and in some cases the trending of features in run-to-failure experiments under constant mechanical parameters such as load and rotational speed, but it lacks any statistical analysis on the effects that varying parameters of the mechanical systems for binary damage states have on detectability. Specifications on data acquisition and choice of algorithm parameters used in extracting the damage-sensitive features remain somewhat vague. This thesis attempts to provide a better global understanding of how variability in the damage detection problem affects the features as a precursor for future work in pattern recognition and optimal detection of damage to rotating machines. This thesis compares the various features under varying conditions and computational parameters in a statistically rigorous way using receiver operating characteristic curves, which compare the probability of detection vs. the probability of false alarms as a means to improve detectability for future use in embedded systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if gear ratio selection would have an effect on peak power and time to peak power production in elite Bicycle Motocross (BMX) cyclists. Eight male elite BMX riders volunteered for the study. Each rider performed three, 10 -s maximal sprints on an Olympic standard indoor BMX track. The riders' bicycles were fitted with a portable SRM power meter. Each rider performed the three sprints using gear ratios of 41 / 16, 43 / 16 and 45 / 16 tooth. The results from the 41 / 16 and 45 / 16 gear ratios were compared to the current standard 43 / 16 gear ratio. Statistically, significant differences were found between the gear ratios for peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 6. 448; p[*]=[*]. 010) and peak torque (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 4. 777; p[*]=[*]. 026), but no significant difference was found for time to peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 0. 200; p[*]=[*]. 821). When comparing gear ratios, the results showed a 45 / 16 gear ratio elicited the highest peak power, 1658 [*]±[*] 221  W, compared to 1436 [*]±[*] 129  W and 1380 [*]±[*] 56  W, for the 43 / 16 and 41 / 16 ratios, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a design tool for geared actuation systems that experience bidirectional exchange of energy with the environment. Despite the asymmetry of efficiency depending on the direction of power transfer in geared systems, typical dynamic models consider a fixed transmission efficiency for all conditions which can result in significant error depending on specific gear selection and the number of stages. This error can cause issues especially in dynamic legged robots and haptic devices when accurate force control is desired. In this paper we present directional impedance, a characteristic of geared transmissions in which the amount of power loss through the transmission differs according to the direction of power flow. Typical robots use electric motors with high gear reduction which introduces larger impedance when power flows from the output back to the motor than when the power flows from motor to output. To investigate the dependence on power flow direction, friction loss from gear teeth sliding in the gear mesh is modeled by a single gear tooth contact model and dynamic models are presented for each power transfer direction. Combinations of 0. 5 mod gears were tested in experiment over a range of sizes between 16 and 120 teeth to characterize the directional effects over multiple gear selections. The experiments confirmed that for a set of differently sized gears, power loss is greater when the larger gear drives the smaller one than in the reverse case, and the asymmetry was up to 17 % in the 16 and 120 <b>tooth</b> <b>gear</b> set. With a multiple stage gearbox, the difference in loss is further amplified. These findings show that directional loss in gears is a non-negligible effect and must be considered in both dynamic modeling and gear selection of robotic actuators. The gear loss model enables the modeling of motor and gearbox as a single package which can then be optimized for desired performance parameters such as peak torque, torque per mass, and mechanical impedance. by Albert Duan Wang.
