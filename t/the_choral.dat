5|$|<b>The</b> <b>choral</b> {{and vocal}} forces consist of two SATB choirs, a children's choir, and eight soloists: three soprano, two alto, tenor, baritone, and bass.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, {{it is neither}} a concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E

5|$|Homophony first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western classical music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. <b>The</b> <b>choral</b> arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western classical music. Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, {{after his}} {{appearance}} on Britain's Got Talent {{but before the}} release of his first album, Johnston embarked {{on a tour of}} Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, <b>The</b> <b>Choral</b> Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|Reger {{structured}} {{the text}} of the psalm in four movements, as a choral symphony, in the typical structure of a symphony: first movement in sonata form (Hauptsatz), slow movement, scherzo and finale. The following table is based on <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> score and shows the movement number, incipit, the verse(s) of the Psalm, voices (SATB chorus, at times divided further), marking, key (beginning and ending in D major) and time, using the symbol for common time.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{is divided}} into 29 {{chapters}} with introduction, notes, and acknowledgments sections. Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama, the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> commentary of the twelve maids. Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea shanty, a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 {{to teach at}} the University of St. Thomas. His {{students}} regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served {{as chair of the}} music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{teaching}} music at Hull House, Smith served as <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> director. She also composed songs and arranged music specifically {{for her students}} to perform. She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry. Under her direction of the music school, the Hull House Boy's Band developed, which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers. Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled {{that one of the}} first jam sessions he ever had occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy's Band. James Petrillo, who would later become the leader of the musician's union, the American Federation of Musicians, was {{also a member of the}} group.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} Anne Frank appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} of artists and social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The Anne Frank Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> music uses texts from the Bible {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> passages.|$|E
50|$|Scottsburg High School {{also has}} a <b>choral</b> {{department}}. Currently, <b>the</b> Scottsburg <b>Choral</b> department sponsors beginning choir and an advanced choir. Owen Egeberg was a longtime director for <b>the</b> Scottsburg <b>Choral</b> Department, leading <b>the</b> choir to win many awards such as ISSMA's Division I Gold and Silver awards. Under Egeberg's direction, the Scottsburg High School Choir has also competed at the Indiana Music Education Association's Circle the State With Song competition, coming 1st place in their division. After Egeberg's retirement after the 2013-2014 school year, <b>the</b> Scottsburg <b>Choral</b> Department was led by Xavier University graduate Erica Phillips from 2014-2016.

5|$|Unlike oratorios or operas, {{which are}} {{generally}} structured dramaturgically into arias, recitatives and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in movements. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, scherzo and finale, or {{as with many}} instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure of movements. The written text in a choral symphony shares equal standing with the music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments. Over time the use of text allowed <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for <b>the</b> <b>choral</b> components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} any aspect of the production, even song selection, as he wanted to be surprised by the result. The style of arrangements followed {{in the tradition of the}} shows preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E
