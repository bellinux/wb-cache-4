5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> {{propelled}} California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to {{a center}} of the global imagination and the destination {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic-mindedness. For example, in the midst of <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush,</b> towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. <b>The</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make <b>The</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush,</b> a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E
5|$|Settlements of <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into {{existence}} and then faded. <b>The</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, {{a legacy of}} Chinese miners who came. While {{there are not many}} Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.|$|E
50|$|In the US <b>the</b> major <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> were <b>the</b> California <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> <b>the</b> Colorado <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> and <b>the</b> Alaska <b>gold</b> <b>rush.</b>|$|R

25|$|In New Zealand <b>the</b> Central Otago <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> from 1861 {{attracted}} prospectors from <b>the</b> California <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> and <b>the</b> Victorian <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> {{and many}} {{moved on to}} <b>the</b> West Coast <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> from 1864.|$|R
5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Lapland <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Ivalo <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush,</b> was a <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> that {{occurred}} in Lapland, Grand Duchy of Finland, during the 1870s. <b>The</b> Lapland <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> started in <b>the</b> valley of the Ivalojoki river in 1870 and lasted for a few years. Although the scale of <b>the</b> Lapland <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> is not comparable to the major 19th century <b>gold</b> <b>rushes,</b> <b>the</b> Lapland <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> has great local significance in Lapland and across Finland.|$|R
50|$|Unlike a {{majority}} of towns in the area, Kyneton predates <b>the</b> Victorian <b>gold</b> <b>rushes,</b> having been established in 1850, whereas <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> started <b>the</b> year after.

The post office opened on 1 July 1843 as Mount Macedon and was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> on the Native {{peoples of the}} region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} from their work as guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th century, {{numerous}} <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> {{in remote}} regions {{around the globe}} caused large migrations of miners, such as <b>the</b> California <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> of 1849, <b>the</b> Victorian <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush,</b> and <b>the</b> Klondike <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush.</b> <b>The</b> discovery of <b>gold</b> in <b>the</b> Witwatersrand led to the Second Boer War and ultimately the founding of South Africa.|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Cariboo <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> is <b>the</b> {{most famous}} of <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> in British Columbia, {{so much so that}} it is {{sometimes}} erroneously cited [...] as the reason for the creation of the Colony of British Columbia. The Colony's creation had been prompted by an influx of American prospectors to <b>the</b> Fraser Canyon <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> three years earlier in 1858, which had its locus in the area from Lillooet to Yale.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic {{material as}} they searched for pure gold, {{and it was}} used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces (370t) of gold were removed {{in the first five}} years of <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> (worth over US$16billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|The prospectors {{came from}} many nations, {{although}} an estimated majority of 60 to 80 percent were Americans or recent immigrants to America. Most {{had no experience}} in the mining industry, being clerks or salesmen. Mass resignations of staff to join <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> became notorious. In Seattle, this included the mayor, twelve policemen, and {{a significant percentage of}} the city's streetcar drivers.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> in <b>the</b> world's history, <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> lasted <b>the</b> longest, {{from the}} 1690s into the 19th century.

Much like other <b>gold</b> <b>rushes</b> around <b>the</b> {{world of the}} era, the natural resources received notable environmental degradation from the mining process. What sets <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> apart is that the consequences from losing environmentally crucial resources did not hinder <b>the</b> mining of <b>gold.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{river is}} known for its once {{prolific}} runs of anadromous fish, notably Chinook salmon and steelhead, which sustained Native American tribes for thousands of years. Due to its remoteness, the Trinity did not feature prominently in the early European colonization of California, but <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> in the mid-1800s brought thousands of gold seekers to the area. The river was named by Major Pierson B. Reading who, upon reaching the river in 1848, mistakenly believed it to flow into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay. During and after <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> the influx of settlers and miners into the Trinity River country led to conflict with indigenous tribes, many of which saw severe depopulation due to fighting and foreign diseases. In the following decades logging and ranching, combined with mining runoff, significantly changed the river's ecology and led to the decline of its fish populations.|$|E
