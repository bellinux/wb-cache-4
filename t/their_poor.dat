Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was plagued}} by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point {{shooting}} percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 {{in both of these}} categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> performance shooting from beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10. The following chart displays player per-game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament.|$|E

5|$|From 1994 to 2006, Kahn {{was part}} of the German {{national}} team, in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas Köpke; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team reached the final. While Germany was several times derided for <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> performance, Kahn's prowess proved to be the deciding factor in several games until the final, where Germany lost 0–2 to Brazil and Kahn made a mistake on Brazil's first goal. Nevertheless, he was named the tournament's best player and received the Golden Ball award.|$|E

They saved the club from being relegated in the 33rd round against Al-Naft where they won 2–1 and also because of Al-Kahraba's loss to Zakho in the last round. Al-Talaba passed the round of 32 of the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup where they were up against Al-Zawra'a, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning 3–1 in the second leg before the tournament was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days were {{coming to an end}} and relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E

5|$|The 1885 {{season was}} an annus horribilis for Somerset County Cricket Club. Captained by Edward Sainsbury, {{who had taken}} over from Stephen Newton, captain for the {{previous}} three seasons, they played six first-class cricket matches. Somerset's only win of the season came in their first match; all the other were lost. Two of the losses, those away against Gloucestershire and Surrey, number among the county's ten heaviest defeats. Somerset were unable to field a full team for their fourth match, which coupled with <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> results and lack of fixtures resulted in the club being stripped of its first-class status {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The Tlaxcalan {{allies of}} the Spanish who {{accompanied}} them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.|$|E

Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E

5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan despite <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> {{relationship}} {{to face a}} common enemy in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and Bryan faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a singles match via countout. Orton and Bryan faced {{each other for the}} third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a Street Fight Match after he was forced to submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1941, {{officials}} in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer {{to be used by}} the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour, as well as <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> performance during the conflict. Consequently, the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced, and none ever saw combat. A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design in light of this decision, including equipping reconnaissance units with them, or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence. One variant on the Mk VIII was designed, the Alecto self-propelled gun which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close-support vehicle by airborne forces; however only a few were ever produced and they were never used in combat.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> {{qualifying}} campaign, Argentina {{were considered}} title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At {{the start of}} the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched. He wore the captain's armband {{for the first time in}} their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners. In the round of 16, they defeated Mexico 3–1, with Messi assisting their first goal, a controversial strike that stood despite being offside.|$|E

The delegation included one middle-distance runner, one short-distance sprinter and two swimmers: José Luis Ebatela Nvo, Mari Paz Mosanga Motanga, Eric Moussambani and Paula Barila Bolopa respectively. All four athletes qualified for the games through wildcard places. Moussambani {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

5|$|Happy Brothers, <b>Their</b> <b>Poor</b> Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E

5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis {{complained to}} the British Archaeological Association that more {{needed to be done}} to protect the ruins, contrasting <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion. The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II.

They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after <b>their</b> <b>poor</b> showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|E

York won the Fourth Division championship with 101 points in 1983–84, becoming the first Football League team to achieve a three-figure points total in a season. In January 1985, York recorded a 1–0 home victory over First Division Arsenal in the fourth round of the 1984–85 FA Cup, courtesy of an 89th-minute penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They proceeded to draw 1–1 at home with European Cup holders Liverpool in February 1985, but lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield; York's record cup defeat. The teams met again in the following season's FA Cup, and after another 1–1 home draw, Liverpool won 3–1 in the replay after extra time at Anfield. Their finish of seventh in the Third Division in 1985–86 marked the fifth consecutive season York had improved their end-of-season league ranking.|$|E
