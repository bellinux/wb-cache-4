5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners.

25|$|Taranaki is geologically young, having {{commenced}} activity approximately 135,000years ago. The {{most recent}} volcanic activity was {{the production of}} a lava dome in the crater and its collapse {{down the side of the}} mountain in the 1850s or 1860s. Between 1755 and 1800, an eruption sent a pyroclastic flow down the mountain's northeast flanks, and a moderate ash eruption occurred about 1755, of the size of Ruapehu's activity in 1995/1996.

25|$|Limited {{evidence}} describes {{conditions in}} Australia. Lake records in Victoria suggest that conditions, {{at least in}} the south of the state, were wet and/or unusually cool. In the north, evidence suggests fairly dry conditions, but coral cores from the Great Barrier Reef show similar rainfall as today but with less variability.

500|$|The {{flammability}} of the crinoline {{was widely}} reported. It is estimated that, {{during the late}} 1850s and late 1860s in England, about 3,000 women were killed in crinoline-related fires. One such incident, {{the death of a}} 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, [...] "distended by a crinoline," [...] ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace to reach some spoons on the mantelpiece, and she {{died as a result of}} extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was [...] "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General," [...] passed a verdict of [...] "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline." [...] A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women's crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde's illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their evening gowns caught fire. Slaveykov reported in 1864 <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 14 years, at least 39,927 women worldwide had died in crinoline-related fires, opining that it was more deadly than the practice of sati or the auto-da-fé.

In 1990, approximately 43 percent of the world’s population was living on less than $1.25 a day and has dropped to about 16 percent in 2008. Maternal deaths have dropped from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. Under-five mortality rates have also dropped, from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011.
