5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E
25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

500|$|Those within TNA held strong {{negative}} feelings toward Hall for missing the event; many felt {{he should have}} at least tried {{to make it to the}} show. Dixie Carter was upset at Joe's comments prior to the main event, believing Joe tried to go [...] "into business for himself."

500|$|Ben Child of The Guardian said, [...] "Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's {{impressive}} collective charisma, Thor: The Dark World is {{far from}} a franchise killer." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said, [...] "Thor: The Dark World delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com said, [...] "There's just enough tension and humor in Thor: The Dark World to make the film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just." [...] Echoing other critics' sentiments, Frank Lovece of Film Journal International wrote, [...] "Is it wrong that the best relationship in Thor: The Dark World is between the titular Norse-god superhero and his adoptive brother Loki? To take nothing away from Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, ... it's the complicated love-hate between Thor and the trickster god Loki that you can't <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> eyes from." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1941, Vasey was {{promoted}} to temporary brigadier and took command of the 6th Division's 19th Infantry Brigade following the departure of Horace Robertson to Australia on medical grounds. He led it in Greece, suffering a defeat at the Battle of Vevi. Vasey's instructions to his men were couched in typical Vasey terms: [...] "Here you bloody well are and here you bloody well stay. And if any bloody German gets between your post and the next, <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> bloody bren around and shoot him up the arse." [...] The 19th Infantry Brigade was evacuated to Crete, where it fought in the Battle of Crete. Vasey was commended {{for his work in}} Crete and was among the last to be evacuated to Egypt, but some 3,000 Australians were taken prisoner. Although it was a bitter defeat, Vasey's performance was considered outstanding; he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), awarded a Bar to his DSO, and later the Greek War Cross.|$|E
500|$|Mustaine has {{elaborated}} on {{the subject}} matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that [...] "Forget to Remember" [...] was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook. [...] "The Blackest Crow" [...] has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar, while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert; however, neither appeared on the song. [...] "Don't <b>Turn</b> <b>Your</b> Back..." [...] was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as [...] "the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help you look for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrison's {{also contributed}} [...] "Been Down So Long", a song {{inspired}} by folk singer Richard Fariña's book Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me and Furry Lewis's tune, [...] "I Will <b>Turn</b> <b>Your</b> Money Green". A conventional blues song reminiscent of earlier Doors performances, the lyrics showed depression, liberation, and sexuality owing to Morrison's potential imprisonment. He also contributed the blues number [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window". Unlike {{most of the}} other tracks, it was composed in the studio. Manzarek recalled that [...] "Jim said it was about living in Venice , in a hot room, with a hot girlfriend, and an open window, and a bad time. It could have been about Pamela Courson". L.A. Woman closes its first side with the title track, the lengthiest song on the album. Thought of as Morrison's final goodbye to Los Angeles, it communicated his mixed feelings of passion and disdain for [...] "the city of night". The lyrics feature an anagram for Morrison: [...] "Mr. Mojo Risin'".|$|E
500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He stuck out his hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> back on your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called <b>Turn</b> <b>Your</b> Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing. I thought it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] and [...] "Man Overboard".|$|E
