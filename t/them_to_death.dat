5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others.

5|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} conflict was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675.

A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
