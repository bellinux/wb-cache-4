5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E
5|$|Five Red Data Book {{invertebrate}} {{species have}} been recorded in the area. These include: the soldier flies Odontomyia ornata and Stratiomys singularior, hover fly Lejops vittata, the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus), and the water beetle Hydrovatus clypealis. Nationally scarce species include the aquatic snail Gyraulus laevis, <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), and the ladybird Coccidula scutellata.|$|E
5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of the}} seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. <b>The</b> <b>hairy</b> seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E

He attempts {{to use it}} and them (and by extension, Jimmy Olsen) to kill <b>the</b> <b>Hairies,</b> an underground, technologically advanced society. <b>The</b> <b>Hairies</b> were literally neighbors of the Project and both were near the Evil Factory, which strove to destroy the others. Assisting the Legion in fighting the Factory was a clone of Scrapper called 'Scrapper Trooper', who was designed for military support of the Project.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} [...] "step-ups" [...] who call {{themselves}} [...] "the Hairies," [...] super hippies who have developed an evolved knowledge-base, and developed transport and defense technology beyond the understanding of modern-day humans. <b>The</b> <b>Hairies</b> live outside <b>the</b> direct control of Cadmus, living inside a mobile [...] "Mountain of Judgement," [...] that constantly keeps them hidden from the affairs of both Cadmus and society in general. Prior to moving to <b>the</b> mountain, <b>the</b> <b>Hairies</b> lived in a forest of living tree-houses called the Habitat, which is right outside some of Cadmus' main facilities.|$|R
5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands {{can be found in the}} surface of <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|The various {{habitats}} provide {{homes to}} numerous species of insects. There are 700 moth species {{recorded in the}} nature reserve, again {{a quarter of the}} national total. At different spots across the site butterflies (including the green hairstreak), damselflies (like the large red), and dragonflies (such as <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> dragonfly) can be observed. According to a 2005 report, the exceedingly rare thirteen-spotted ladybird (Hippodamia 13-punctata) was recently observed at the head, the first sighting in the UK since 1952.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E

5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. <b>The</b> <b>Hairy</b> Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{example of}} a nontrivial tangent bundle {{is that of the}} unit sphere S2: this tangent bundle is nontrivial as a {{consequence}} of <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> ball theorem. Therefore, the sphere is not parallelizable.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} in {{computer}} graphics is {{to generate a}} non-zero vector in R3 that is orthogonal to a given non-zero one. There is no single continuous function that can do this for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector orthogonal to the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent {{to the surface of}} that sphere where it touches the radius. However, <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> ball theorem says there exists no continuous function that can do this for every point on the sphere (i.e. every given vector).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hairy</b> {{parts of}} the body such as the forearm or the leg have two groups of nerve endings: those that end along with the hair follicles, and also with the arborizations of unmyelinated axons which are {{referred}} to as “free” nerve endings because they are served by both myelinated and unmyelinated axons.|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to kill every baldy of the {{opposing}} team, usually <b>the</b> <b>hairies.</b> This is achieved by constructing houses which breed baldies.

25|$|Calliphoridae {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse.

25|$|Flocks are {{sometimes}} formed with <b>the</b> <b>hairy</b> woodpecker (Picoides villosus), downy woodpecker (P. pubescens), northern flicker (Coloptes auratus), Clark's nutcracker, and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for {{a portion of}} the year, but these species are not important for the maintenance of the flock. The benefits of interspecific flocking are probably for protection from predators during feeding and to assist in locating locally abundant but scattered food.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} these {{problems}} that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems do rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism.
