5|$|Cave 25 {{is longer}} than cave 24 with several small and big rooms. <b>These</b> <b>rooms</b> also have seating {{arrangements}} in niches which display irregular excavations denoting poor condition of the rock, which probably stopped further work on this cave.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the study}} are Churchill's bedroom and his ensuite bathroom, with sunken bath. At {{the time of}} the house's opening to the public in 1966, <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill's family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill's {{daughter}} Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans to make them accessible by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> {{is exactly the same}} size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
50|$|Besh-Ba-Gowah {{architecture}} {{consists of}} multi-storied, masonry room block clusters connected by long, narrow corridors or elongated plazas. <b>These</b> <b>room</b> blocks and corridors are situated {{around a large}} communal plaza area measuring 12 meters north/south by 27 meters east/west.|$|R
50|$|When people fail to gain self-verifying {{reactions}} {{through the}} display of identity cue or through choosing self-verifying social environments, they may still acquire such evaluations by systematically evoking confirming reactions. For example, depressed people behave in negative ways toward their room mates, thus causing <b>these</b> <b>room</b> mates to reject them.|$|R
50|$|Arnaud's has 14 {{different}} private dining rooms, Mezzanine, Creole Cottage, Bourbon Suites, Edison Park, 1920, Iberville, Bienville, Toulouse, Dauphine, Lafitte, Bacchus, Gold, Irma, and Count's. Each of <b>these</b> <b>room</b> is {{furnished with}} different antiques, chandeliers, and drapes. The rooms {{are able to}} hold up to 220 people, and can be reserved for any occasion.|$|R
5|$|The {{basement}} {{consists of}} an arcade of cloisters on three sides, surrounding several vaulted rooms including the sacristy, chapter house and warming house. <b>These</b> <b>rooms</b> were situated under the original dormitory. At {{the other end of}} the building, below what was formerly the abbess' chambers and the great hall, are two rooms and the main passage. On the north side, underneath the original refectory, is the undercroft.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police {{headquarters}} {{is situated in}} the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> {{does not lead to}} prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.|$|E
5000|$|Provisions in the Rider specify Hotel Rooms {{based on}} [...] "Room night", which is 1 person, per room, per night. A theatre company can stretch {{the use of}} <b>these</b> <b>room</b> nights by double occupancy, though Union and/or {{contractual}} agreements with the performers may prohibit this practice for {{some or all of}} the touring company.|$|R

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{adventure}} takes place in two locations: the upper level fortress of the hill giants' lair, and the dungeon level beneath it. In the upper level there are halls, barracks and common rooms. <b>These</b> <b>rooms</b> house Chief Nosnra and other hill giants, ogres, and servants. The dungeon level consists of slave quarters, torture chambers, and caverns. These house troglodytes, bugbears, and carrion crawlers. The majority of the treasure can be found by searching the dungeons. The chief's treasure room contains {{a map of the}} glacial rift from Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and a magic chain that automatically transports the party there.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is opulently, but {{by the standards of}} the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the piano nobile, or the first floor, and state rooms. The most impressive of <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} state {{rooms on the}} first floor of the east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, drawing room (great chamber), small drawing room and two bedrooms. All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but are likely to have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in <b>these</b> <b>rooms.</b> All the state rooms contain elaborate plasterwork and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E

For a few occasions, they {{have been used for}} playing table tennis, but were previously the only art classrooms in the school. <b>These</b> <b>room</b> along with most of the other S classrooms, the N corridor, and the C corridor are areas of dire need for either complete demolition or replacement.|$|R
5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting are also in the former board room, which is located in a 'commanding' position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of <b>these</b> <b>rooms,</b> now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to a full basement, the 10,000 square-foot building features two large “lodge rooms” on the second floor, including one measuring 37x60 feet with 20-foot ceilings. Each room also features a loft area (accessible by separate stairways) with small windows that look down over the <b>rooms.</b> <b>These</b> loft <b>rooms</b> serve as a storage area for the Masons.|$|R
50|$|The playfield of Alien Crush {{consists}} of two main screens arranged vertically, {{with a pair of}} flippers at the bottom of each. The play stops momentarily as the ball shifts from one screen to the next. There are also several hidden/bonus <b>rooms.</b> <b>These</b> hidden <b>rooms</b> mainly involve destroying all the aliens (or several waves of aliens) for bonus points.|$|R

5|$|Following a major {{expansion}} in 2003, {{a suite of}} rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, {{was added to the}} museum. The restoration of <b>these</b> <b>rooms,</b> which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The museum, the development of which cost a further £6 million raised from private fundraising, makes extensive use of audiovisual technology. The centrepiece is a 15-metre interactive table that enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The Churchill Museum won the 2006 Council of Europe Museum Prize. During 2009-2011 the museum received over 300,000 visitors a year. In May 2010 the name of the museum was shortened to Churchill War Rooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in <b>these</b> <b>rooms.</b> The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come in waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E

5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. <b>These</b> <b>rooms</b> feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of <b>these</b> <b>rooms</b> is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home for the owners. <b>These</b> <b>rooms</b> above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E
