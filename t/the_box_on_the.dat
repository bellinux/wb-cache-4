2500|$|Simulations {{demonstrate}} that a suitable [...] "nearest neighbour rule" [...] eventually results {{in all the}} particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, {{even though there is}} no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time (see the interactive simulation in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right). SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm. Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales, some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust. It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.|$|E
2500|$|When {{counting}} the number [...] of trials before r failures, the expected {{total number of}} trials of a negative binomial distribution with parameters [...] is r/(1nbsp&−nbsp&p). To see this intuitively, imagine the above experiment is performed many times. That is, a set of trials is performed until [...] failures are obtained, then another set of trials, and then another etc. Write down the number of trials performed in each experiment: [...] and set [...] Now we would expect about [...] failures in total. Say the experiment was performed [...] times. Then there are [...] failures in total. So we would expect , so [...] See that [...] is just {{the average number of}} trials per experiment. That is what we mean by [...] "expectation". The average number of successes per experiment is , which must have expected value equal to [...] This agrees with the mean given in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side of this page.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides {{into the back of the}} box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E
