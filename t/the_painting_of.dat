5|$|The Sistine Chapel {{was built}} by Pope Sixtus IV within the Vatican {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} St. Peter's Basilica and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of Renaissance painters who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and Botticelli. The Chapel was further enhanced under Pope Julius II by <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the ceiling by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 and by <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the Last Judgment, commissioned by Pope Clement VII and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo. The tapestries on the lowest tier, today best known from the Raphael Cartoons (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.|$|E
5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of effort into the painting, {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|In 1607, {{after the}} death of Leonard Fryer, Peake was {{appointed}} serjeant-painter to King James I, sharing the office with John De Critz, who had held the post since 1603. The role entailed <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> original portraits and their reproduction as new versions, to be given as gifts or sent to foreign courts, as well as the copying and restoring of portraits by other painters in the royal collection.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, such as <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s {{work is not}} recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> {{a colored}} substance onto the tongue {{which is then}} transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{alterations}} proved {{successful in}} stabilising {{the tower and}} in serving {{the needs of the}} church, and the church remained little changed for the next 130years; the most notable alterations during this period were the replacement of the glass in the chancel's two leper windows with stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas {{had been asked to}} create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon fresco. Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco but added a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E

50|$|Several vase {{painters}} had specialised in <b>painting</b> Siana cups. <b>The</b> {{most important}} {{among them was}} <b>the</b> C <b>Painter.</b> Others include <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> <b>of</b> Athens 553, <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> <b>of</b> Boston CA, <b>the</b> Kassandra <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sandal <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Civico <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Griffin-Bird <b>Painter.</b> At present, about 1,000 cups and fragments are known; a classification vital for their chronology and stylistic categorisation has been developed by Herman Brijder. A special type are so called Merrythought Cups, with a forked handle.|$|R

5|$|The painted frieze {{above the}} astronomical clock shows five deities from {{classical}} antiquity, each representing both {{a day of}} the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.|$|E
5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back from the Middle East. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E

5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E
5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E
5|$|The early frescoes {{inside the}} cathedral were {{restored}} in the 18th century. Stepanos Lehatsi (Stephen of Poland) illustrated the belfry in 1664. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Armenian painters created frescoes of {{scenes from the}} old testament and Armenian saints. Naghash Hovnatan painted parts of the interior between 1712 and 1721. His paintings on the dome and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the Mother of God under the altar have survived to this day. Other members of the prominent Hovnatanian family (Hakob, Harutyun and Hovnatan) created paintings throughout the 18th century. Their work was continued by the succeeding generations of the same family (Mkrtum and Hakob) in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The first {{staff were}} posted {{to the new}} {{contingent}} headquarters at Holsworthy Barracks in September 1988. At the same time, Major J.J. Hutchings was deployed as liaison officer to UN HQ in New York. In October, the CDF formally tasked the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) to raise, train, equip and support the force for Namibia. By December the two units comprising 1ASC had been raised from more than thirty different units of the Australian Army, and were being trained and prepared for deployment. Equipment, vehicles and weapons were procured, transferred from across the army and prepared at Moorebank; this included <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> all vehicles and major equipment items in UN livery and packing items for transport to Namibia. During the buildup it was recognised that the families required support during the deployment, and Network 17 was established to support the mostly Sydney-based soldiers' and officers' families.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
5|$|Vincent begins {{creating}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> {{the church}} and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy stay back as he enters the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast is blind, the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside {{the church and}} Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E
