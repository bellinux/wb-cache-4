5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women and sent them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, {{but with all the}} sick prisoners being sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of <b>the</b> environment on <b>gas</b> surface density and star formation efficiency of cluster spiral galaxies is investigated. We extend previous work on radial profiles by a pixel-to pixel analysis looking for asymmetries due <b>to</b> environmental interactions. <b>The</b> star formation rate {{is derived from}} GALEX UV and Spitzer total infrared data. As in field galaxies, the star formation rate for most Virgo galaxies is approximately proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molecular <b>gas</b> mass. Except for NGC 4438, the cluster environment {{does not affect the}} star formation efficiency with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molecular <b>gas.</b> Gas truncation is not associated with major changes in <b>the</b> total <b>gas</b> surface density distribution of the inner disk of Virgo spiral galaxies. In three galaxies, possible increases in the molecular fraction and the star formation efficiency with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> total <b>gas,</b> of factors of 1. 5 to 2, are observed on the windward side of the galactic disk. A significant increase of the star formation efficiency with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molecular <b>gas</b> content on <b>the</b> windward side of ram pressure-stripped galaxies is not observed. The ram-pressure stripped extraplanar gas of 3 highly inclined spiral galaxies shows a depressed star formation efficiency with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> total <b>gas,</b> and one of them (NGC 4438) shows a depressed rate even with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molecular <b>gas.</b> <b>The</b> interpretation is that stripped <b>gas</b> loses <b>the</b> gravitational confinement and associated pressure of the galactic disk, and <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> flow is diverging, so <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> density decreases and the star formation rate drops. However, <b>the</b> stripped extraplanar <b>gas</b> in one highly inclined galaxy (NGC 4569) shows a normal star formation efficiency with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> total <b>gas.</b> We propose this galaxy is different because it is observed long after peak pressure, and its extraplanar gas is now in a converging flow as it resettles back into the disk...|$|R

5|$|The {{amount of}} gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires {{may depend on}} when the {{planetary}} embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading {{to the formation of}} a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metalicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.|$|E

5|$|The gas {{chambers}} {{worked to}} their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during {{the massacre of}} Hungary's Jews.

From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, {{at a rate of}} 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period.

5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning.

No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers.
