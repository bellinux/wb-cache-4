5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control <b>training</b> <b>procedure</b> in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

30|$|The above {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} a personal computer using Intel(R) Core(TM) i 7 960 CPU 3.20 GHz with 24.0 Gbytes RAM. The proposed method was implemented by using Matlab. The average computation time for the <b>training</b> <b>procedures</b> in our method is about 4.67 × 103 s for Datasets 1 to 3, respectively. The average computation time for the test procedures is about 6.02 × 102 s for Datasets 1 to 3, i.e., 1.15 × 10 − 2 for each area, respectively. From the obtained results, the computation costs of the <b>training</b> <b>procedures</b> are much larger {{than those of the}} test procedures. In the proposed method, we use an exhaustive search for determining the combination parameters of multiple kernels and the parameter of each kernel. Thus, high computation costs are required. However, the exhaustive search can be simply parallelized for each combination of parameters. Therefore, by introducing a parallel search for the parameters, the above computation time for the <b>training</b> <b>procedures</b> can be reduced to about 8.96 s.|$|R
40|$|Background: US Air Force (USAF) pilot {{selection}} and <b>training</b> <b>procedures</b> have changed substantially {{in the last}} several years. Pilot selection procedures were augmented with the introduction of computer-based testing to assess pilot aptitude. <b>Training</b> <b>procedures</b> have changed in an effort to modernize the training fleet and provide better, more specialized training earlier in the training process. Results: Despite several studies showing the utility of USAF pilot aptitude tests for predicting training performance, results of a recent policy capturing study suggest that this information is often ignored by pilot candidate selection boards. The two largest sources of USAF pilot trainees relied heavily on measures of officership when making selection decisions. Cumulative research findings suggest that USAF pilot selection decisions could be improved by making better use of currently available personnel attribute data. Further improvements could be expected from the addition of a structured selection interview and measures of personality. _________________________________ THE KEYWORD IN DESCRIBING U. S.

5000|$|DBNs can {{be viewed}} as a {{composition}} of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or autoencoders, where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected, generative energy-based model with a [...] "visible" [...] input layer and a hidden layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised <b>training</b> <b>procedure,</b> where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the [...] "lowest" [...] pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set).|$|E
50|$|The output {{targets in}} the {{response}} units (i.e., the examinee attributes) are compared to the pattern associated with each stimulus input or exemplar (i.e., the expected response patterns). The solution produced initially with the stimulus and association connection weights {{is likely to be}} discrepant resulting in a relatively large error. However, this discrepant result can be used to modify the connection weights thereby leading to a more accurate solution and a smaller error term. One popular approach for approximating the weights so the error term is minimized is with a learning algorithm called the generalized delta rule that is incorporated in a <b>training</b> <b>procedure</b> called back propagation of error.|$|E

50|$|As {{research}} became {{integral to}} the hospital system, medical education also claimed {{a larger role in}} the hospital. By 1785, the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris had established a formal <b>training</b> <b>procedure,</b> including both demonstrations and hands-on experience, and was moving away from separate fields of medicine and surgery. The lack of qualified surgeons coupled with the unprecedented scale of casualties in the revolution motivated medical education reform. Medical students routinely assisted their teachers in the hospital to address understaffing, a marked departure from the historically hands-off style of medical teaching. Guidelines set forth by the revolutionary government, defined by Joseph-Ignace Guillotin and Félix Vicq-d'Azyr, formally asserted the importance of hospitals in medical education; by 1794, hospitals were regarded as the principle institution of medical training.|$|E
