The ballots are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the {{assistance}} of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became evident that the soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost. Recutting <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{monument}} was discounted as a solution due to the long term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure: {{the decision was made to}} expand the war memorial instead. A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War, 927 from the Second World War and three from subsequent conflicts. This addition to the Cenotaph was opened on 11 December 2011.|$|E

25|$|As these {{investigations}} continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been {{claimed that the}} Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women. Some have cited Japanese inventory logs and employee sheets on the battlefield as evidence for this claim. For example, one of <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list was of a comfort woman who stated {{she was forced to}} be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.|$|E
2500|$|According to Magness, <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Talpiot ossuaries {{indicate}} that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name.

The results came from Datanomic who had screened the 6.8 million names on the register against a World-Check database of high risk [...] individuals and businesses.

2500|$|In February 2007, {{the term}} [...] "China" [...] was {{replaced}} by the term [...] "Taiwan" [...] on Taiwan postage stamps to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident that began on February 28, 1947 that was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang (KMT). In that same month, the name of the official postal service of Taiwan was changed from the Chunghwa Post Co. to The Taiwan Post Co. The company's name was changed back on 1 August 2008, and <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> postal stamps were reversed in late 2008, soon after the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-Jeou won back presidency and ended 8 years of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rule.|$|E
2500|$|David Mavorah, {{a curator}} of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, points out that <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ossuaries were {{extremely}} common. [...] "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there {{to say this is}} the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely." [...] David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the statistics section above.|$|E
2500|$|... "Spoonman" [...] was {{originally}} {{written for the}} [...] to the 1992 film Singles. At this time, Soundgarden, along with fellow alternative rock band Pearl Jam, {{was working on the}} soundtrack for the film. Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament had been put in charge of creating the name for a fictional band that would appear in the film. Before finally choosing Citizen Dick for its name, Ament had compiled a list of potential names which included the name [...] "Spoonman". The name was inspired by Artis the Spoonman, a street performer from Santa Cruz, California and later Seattle, Washington, who plays music with a set of spoons. Soundgarden vocalist and songwriter Chris Cornell eventually used <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list to create songs for the film. [...] "Spoonman" [...] was among these, and an acoustic version was created from it. This early version of the song can be heard during a scene in the film in which a poster advertising a Citizen Dick show is stapled to a lightpost.|$|E

2500|$|On January 28, 1981, {{a teenage}} victim's body between fifteen and twenty-one was found {{concealed}} by trees in Bellevue, Bossier Parish, Louisiana. She wore jeans, a white, long-sleeved shirt with pink, yellow and blue stripes, a beige sweater with a hood, shoes {{with the names}} [...] "Michael Brisco", [...] "David", [...] "Resha", and [...] "D. Davies", white socks with blue and yellow streaks, white boxer briefs, a white bra and a leather belt with a buckle reading [...] "Buffalo Nickel", with a buffalo design. None of <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clothing amounted to meaningful leads, although they were speculated to have belonged to companions of the Jane Doe. The victim had also painted her fingernails prior to her murder. The shoes were later determined to have been size seven. A knife found in the soil near her remains {{is thought to have}} been the murder weapon, as the victim had been stabbed nine times. Most of the evidence recovered from the scene was destroyed due to a fire in 2005 at the facility in which they were stored.|$|E
2500|$|Moments {{after the}} wiretapped conversation, at 01:00 UTC, a man calling himself [...] "Mr. Singh" [...] made {{reservations}} for two flights on 22 June: one for [...] "Jaswant Singh" [...] to fly from Vancouver to Toronto on Canadian Pacific Air Lines (CP) Flight 086 {{and one for}} [...] "Mohinderbel Singh" [...] to fly from Vancouver to Tokyo on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 and connect to Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok. At 02:20 GMT on the same day, another call changed the reservation {{in the name of}} [...] "Jaswant Singh" [...] from CP 086 to CP 060, also flying from Vancouver to Toronto. The caller further requested to be put on the waiting list for AI 181 from Toronto to Montreal and AI 182 from Montreal to Bombay. The next day, at 19:10 GMT, a man wearing a turban paid for the two tickets with $3,005 in cash at a CP ticket office in Vancouver. <b>The</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reservations were changed: [...] "Jaswant Singh" [...] became [...] "M.

The reservation and purchase of these tickets together would be used as evidence to link the two flights to one plot, despite some claims that it was only a coincidence.|$|E
2500|$|Guy {{also became}} often {{one of the}} {{characters}} most requested {{to be added to the}} Capcom games' characters rosters. On the official Capcom forums, he was most requested Final Fight character to be added to the roster of Street Fighter IV, as well as the second most requested character overall to be added to the game. In 2009, GamesRadar too included him in the list of 12 fighters they would like to see in Super Street Fighter IV.

He also ranked 10th on the list of top 55 most requested Marvel vs. Capcom 3 DLC characters in a poll by Nico Nico Douga in 2010. In the English-language survey by Namco, Guy was less popular than in Japan and was the 23rd most requested Street Fighter side character to be added to the roster of Tekken X Street Fighter.|$|E
