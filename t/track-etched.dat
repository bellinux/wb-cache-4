5000|$|John Quinn’s {{contributions}} to chemical engineering science and its applications pertain {{to a broad}} range of phenomena and processes: The role of the interface in mass transfer: This work, largely conducted at Illinois, aimed at quantifying the magnitude of the mass transfer resistance hypothesized to exist at the nearly-infinitely-thin interface and to influence the rates of mass transport of species to and from bulk phases on either side of it. This very fundamental problem also engaged such contemporaries as Profs. Sherwood at M.I.T., Pigford and his then-student Scriven at Delaware, Danckwerts in the U.K., and Levich in the U.S.S.R. Prof. Quinn and his students distinguished themselves by fashioning a number of elegant experimental systems (e.g., the moving-band absorber) capable of producing the very “young” or fresh interfaces at which it was possible to probe interfacial mass transfer resistances associated with gas-liquid and liquid- liquid transport. [...] These endeavors would ultimately expand to include exploration of the role of insoluble stagnant films at interfaces and of transport-induced convective instabilities arising on either side of them. Transport fundamentals in finely porous membranes: John Quinn’s investigations of transport in nano- and microporous membranes (both synthetic and biological) would be grounded in experiments conducted with <b>track-etched</b> porous mica membranes fabricated by a dozen of his students at both Illinois and Penn. [...] Using this experimental platform to validate their analysis, Quinn and his student John L. Anderson (currently President, Illinois Institute of Technology) developed and solved the fundamental hydrodynamic equations governing hindered diffusion of species (incorporating the effects of both steric exclusion and Brownian motion) in nanometer- and sub-micron pores in a way that avoided the restrictive assumptions necessary in prior (and simpler) treatments of this problem. [...] This body of work would later expand to include analysis of electrodynamic/electrokinetic effects of various microsolutes, macromolecules, and colloids as they diffused across and/or adsorbed to the walls of neutral and electrically charged membrane pores.|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the most applicable {{technology for the}} short-term assessment of domestic radon levels, comparative assessments {{of a number of}} integrating detector types, including <b>track-etch,</b> electret and activated charcoal were undertaken. Thirty-four unremediated dwellings in a high-radon area were monitored using <b>track-etch</b> detectors exposed for one-month and three-month periods. In parallel, one-week measurements were made in the same homes at one-month intervals, using co-located <b>track-etch,</b> charcoal and electret detectors exposed simultaneously, while three of the homes were also monitored by continuous-sampling detectors at hourly intervals over extended periods. Calibration of dose-integrating devices against each other and against continuous-monitoring systems confirmed good responsivity and linearity. Although <b>track-etch,</b> charcoal and electret devices are suitable in principle for one-week measurements, zero-exposure offset and natural radon variability cause many one-week results to be equivocal, necessitating repetition of the measurement. One-week exposures can be reliable indicators in low-radon areas or for new properties, but in high-radon areas, the use of three-month exposures is indicated. This analysis also established confidence limits for short-term measurements...|$|R

40|$|Fundamentals of ion {{transport}} in nanopores were studied through a joint experimental and computational effort. The study evaluated both nanoporous polymer membranes and <b>track-etched</b> nanoporous polycarbonate membranes. The <b>track-etched</b> membranes provide a geometrically well characterized platform, while the polymer membranes are {{more closely related}} to ion exchange systems currently deployed in RO and ED applications. The experimental effort explored transport properties of the different membrane materials. Poly(aniline) membranes showed that flux could be controlled by templating with molecules of defined size. <b>Track-etched</b> polycarbonate membranes were modified using oxygen plasma treatments, UV-ozone exposure, and UV-ozone with thermal grafting, providing an avenue to functionalized membranes, increased wettability, and improved surface characteristic lifetimes. The modeling effort resulted in a novel multiphysics multiscale simulation model for field-driven transport in nanopores. This model was applied to a parametric study of the effects of pore charge and field strength on {{ion transport}} and charge exclusion in a nanopore representative of a <b>track-etched</b> polycarbonate membrane. The goal of this research was to uncover the factors that control the flux of ions through a nanoporous material and to develop tools and capabilities for further studies.

40|$|Polyallyldiglycol carbonate-based <b>track-etched</b> {{detectors}} {{can measure}} {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) spectra of charged particles. Accuracy of the spectra is affected by many factors whose effects are difficult to quantify. Typically, only uncertainty arising from the randomness of particle detection is reported in scientific literature. The aim {{of this paper is}} to classify the sources of uncertainties of an LET spectrum measurement and provide a simple model for the calculation of the combined uncertainty. The model was used for a spectrum measured with the <b>track-etched</b> detector (Harzlas TD- 1) on board of the International Space Station from May-October 2009. For some spectrum bins the largest contribution to the combined uncertainty came from the uncertainty arising from the randomness of particle detection. For other bins it came from the uncertainty of the calibration curve. Contribution from the cross talk between bins was small for most of the bins as the width of the bins was relatively large compared to the intrinsic resolution of the <b>track-etched</b> detector. The analysis showed that sources of uncertainties other than the randomness of particle detection should not, in general, be neglected...|$|E

40|$|<b>Track-etched</b> {{functionalized}} nanoporous β-PVDF membrane electrodes, or functionalized membrane electrodes (FMEs), are electrodes {{made from}} <b>track-etched,</b> poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) functionalized nanoporous β-poly(vinylidene fluoride) (β-PVDF) membranes with thin porous Au films sputtered {{on each side}} as electrodes.
