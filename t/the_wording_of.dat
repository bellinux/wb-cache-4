5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Qur'an is whether their content and meaning were truly a divine revelation or they were revealed to the Prophet from God and then transferred into <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> In this regard, there are two perspectives. First, as all Muslims believe, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an {{are the result of}} a divine revelation, where­as the second viewpoint is that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are written by a human and not God. According to this latter perspective, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are sayings of the Prophet of which only the contents are based on a divine revelation. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an not being a divine revelation has been an abandoned and rejected one throughout the Islamic history. This is the reason it has not been the subject of any pertinent discussions. How can <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an be created by Muhammad or Gabriel even though it is believed that the Qur'an is a miracle? This article first defines the concept of revelation and then analyzes various viewpoints and opinions regarding this topic in order to conclude (with evidence) that the Qur'an is <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet. If he had composed <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an and expressed the meaning of the revelation in his own <b>words,</b> then <b>the</b> Qur'an would not be <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God. In this case, the term 'word of God' indicates that the concept of the 'word' should be considered. Thus, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are divine and they can be referred and attributed to God...|$|R

5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("...

Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent.

6000|$|... 1. [Ground.] Because they do {{not believe}} that they are <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God, but rather suppose them to be the inventions of men, written by some politicians, on purpose to make poor ignorant people to submit to some {{religion}} and government.[44] Though {{they do not}} say this, yet their practices testify the same; as he that when he hears <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curse, yet blesseth himself in his heart, and saith he shall have peace, though God saith he shall have none (Deut 29:18-20). And this must needs be, for did but men believe this, that it is <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God, then they must believe that he that speak it is true, therefore shall every word and tittle be fulfilled. And if they come once to this, unless they be stark mad, they will have a care how they do throw themselves under the lash of eternal vengeance. For the reason why the Thessalonians received <b>the</b> <b>Word,</b> was, because they believed it was <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God, and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> man, which did effectually work in them by their thus believing. 'When ye received <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God which ye heard of us,' saith he, 'ye received it not as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> man, but, as it is in truth, <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe' (1 Thess 2:13). So that did a man but receive it in hearing, or reading, or meditating, as it is <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God, they would be converted. 'But <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> preached did not profit,--not being mixed with faith in them that heard it' (Heb 4:2).|$|R

He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E

An Imperial Conference was held afterwards. In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the Indian Empire along with the traditional banners of the Home Nations.
