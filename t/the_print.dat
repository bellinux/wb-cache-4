5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that <b>the</b> <b>print</b> only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold <b>the</b> <b>print,</b> and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of <b>the</b> <b>print</b> spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate onto <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> substrate. <b>The</b> pad <b>printing</b> is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, on <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> product. <b>The</b> photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, consequently on the reproduction of <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate elements. For this purpose four pad printing plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form printing elements of desired depth...|$|R

40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} {{a printing}} plate elastically deformed during the reproduction process. <b>The</b> <b>printing</b> plate is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the plate enables <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other <b>printing</b> techniques. On <b>the</b> other hand, deformations of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and <b>the</b> substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process, <b>the</b> plate making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate, and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of screen ruling on <b>the</b> formation of <b>printing</b> elements and <b>the</b> adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate making process in order to achieve optimal quality of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in <b>the</b> processes of <b>printing</b> plate curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different screen ruling has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|R

The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it.

A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving.
