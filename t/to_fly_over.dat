5|$|On August 8, 2012, a {{controlled}} blast at 72nd Street caused rocks <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> the station site. Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue Subway station at 72nd Street was done incorrectly, causing a large explosion that sent debris {{into the air}} and broke windows of buildings in the area and damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol conducts {{humanitarian}} service missions, {{usually in}} support of the Red Cross. CAP aircrews transport time-sensitive medical materials, including blood and human tissue, when other means of transportation (such as ambulances) are not practical or possible. Following the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City when all general aviation was grounded, one of the first planes <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> the World Trade Center site was a CAP aircraft taking photographs.|$|E
5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} items and treasures located {{throughout}} the game. Many of these treasures are obtained by defeating enemies and include the following: gold; golden water jugs, necklaces, scales of justice, harps, mirrors, and crowns which increase the player's score; hourglasses which refill the Hourglass Timer; hearts which refill the life meter; gauntlets which temporarily double Wonder Boy's attack power; helmets which temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Wing Boots which allow Wonder Boy <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> obstacles; Revival Potions; and magic mantles which make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items {{hidden in the}} game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell, and the ruby.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

5|$|In March 1945, Miller was {{deployed}} to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk, East Anglia. He {{was assigned to}} 169 Squadron, flying Mosquito fighter-bombers. Miller's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and V-2 production and test launch sites {{on the island of}} Peenemünde in the North Sea. On 19 April, Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at Flensburg in northern Germany. In May, his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash, to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt. One of Miller's bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached. Miller's next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered. His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing. On one flight, Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, this night, Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E
5|$|The Twentieth Air Force's XXI Bomber Command began {{arriving}} in the Mariana Islands during October 1944. The Command was led by Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell, who had also participated in Eighth Air Force operations against Germany. XXIBomber Command B-29s flew six practice missions against targets in the Central Pacific during October and November in preparation for their first attack on Japan. On 1November, an F-13 photo reconnaissance variant of the B-29 from the 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron overflew Tokyo; {{this was the first}} American aircraft <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> the city since the Doolittle Raid. Further F-13 sorties were conducted during early November to gather intelligence on aircraft factories and port facilities in the Tokyo–Yokosuka area. The F-13s were generally able to evade the heavy anti-aircraft fire they attracted and the large numbers of Japanese fighters that were scrambled to intercept them as they flew at both high speed and high altitude.|$|E
50|$|On June 3, 2011 American manned jets (or drones) killed Ali Abdullah Naji al-Harithi, a mid-level al-Qaeda operative, {{and several}} other militant {{suspects}} including Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa'eli in southern Yemen. Four civilians were also reportedly killed in the strike, reportedly coordinated by American special forces and CIA operatives based in Sana. According to the Associated Press, in 2011 the US government began building an air base near (or in) Yemen from which the CIA and the US military planned <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> drones <b>over</b> Yemen. The Washington Post reported that the US previously used a base in Djibouti <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> drones <b>over</b> Yemen.
