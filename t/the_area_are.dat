5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory {{says that it is}} due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E

5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian continental shelf. Volcanoes in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> formed because of oceanic crusts and the movement of the shelf itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words.

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E
5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum in the mine pools in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters {{in the waters}}hed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>are</b> resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E
