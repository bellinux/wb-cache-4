5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{has set a}} record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. <b>The</b> <b>clocks</b> would be accurate within a second for a period comparable {{to the age of}} the universe.|$|E

5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create {{both large and small}} seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
50|$|A <b>clock</b> {{accompanied}} <b>the</b> look, as {{was common}} for the channel in these days. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> {{had a white}} background, with embossed dashes at each position round <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> face. <b>The</b> 'TWO' logo was placed below <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> hands different colours: a red second hand, a green minute hand and a blue hour hand. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> was electronically generated using <b>the</b> previous <b>clock</b> generator system and was often used before some news bulletins and before closedown. On this occasion, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> would always fade to white, before fading to black.|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline for the end of the session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> was {{repaired}} {{following the}} destruction of the nearby cathedral, which took a total of six years to complete. Since that time, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> has never needed any repairs. <b>The</b> <b>clock's</b> mechanism is very accurate; up to within 10 seconds. However, it has been observed that its accuracy depends on the time of the year: in <b>the</b> Winter, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> works somewhat slower than in <b>the</b> Summertime. <b>The</b> <b>clock's</b> mechanism has to be rewound once a week, and <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> bells chime every quarter of the hour.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Controlling <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> {{signal delay}} in the {{presence}} of various noise sources, process parameter variations, and environmental effects represents a fundamental problem in the design of high speed synchronous circuits. A methodology for enhancing the layout of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree to reduce the uncertainty of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> signal is presented in this paper. The primary objective of the proposed methodology is to satisfy the timing constraints of the most critical data paths in a circuit. Two different design approaches are described to reduce the delay uncertainty of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> signal. <b>The</b> first approach determines the size of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> buffers to reduce variations in <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> delay. <b>The</b> second approach exploits the common portion among <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> paths that drive the registers of the most critical data paths. The application of these techniques to a set of benchmark circuits demonstrates some interesting tradeoffs among <b>the</b> aggregate <b>clock</b> buffer size, <b>the</b> total wire length of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree, and <b>the</b> power dissipation.

40|$|Although {{a lot of}} {{research}} efforts {{have been made in the}} minimization of the total power consumption caused by <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree, no attention has been paid to the minimization of the peak current caused by <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree. In this paper, we propose an opposite-phase scheme for peak current reduction. Our basic idea is to divide <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> buffers at each level of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree into two sets: an half of clock buffers operate at the same phase of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> source, and another half of clock buffers operate at the opposite phase of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> source. Consequently, our approach can reduce the peak current of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tree nearly 50 %. Experimental data consistently show that our approach works well in practice...|$|R
5000|$|In American football, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> {{continues}} to run after any tackle in bounds, but stops after an incomplete pass, or a tackle out of bounds.
