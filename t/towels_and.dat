5|$|The {{nurse was}} due to arrive at 9:00 the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|Inmates {{are allowed}} to receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, <b>towels,</b> <b>and</b> condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E

On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, <b>towels,</b> <b>and</b> emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E

25|$|Adenoviruses {{are often}} {{transmitted}} by expectorate, {{but can also}} be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> faucet handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools {{that do not have}} enough chlorine in them. As with many other illnesses, good handwashing is one way to inhibit the spread of adenoviruses from one person to another. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.|$|E

25|$|All Roman cities had {{at least}} one Thermae, a popular {{facility}} for public bathing, exercising and socializing. Exercise might include wrestling and weight-lifting, as well as swimming. Bathing was {{an important part of the}} Roman day, where some hours might be spent, at a very low cost subsidized by the government. Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing <b>towels,</b> <b>and</b> at the end of the session, applying olive oil to their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a strigil, a scraper made of wood or bone. Romans did not wash with soap and water as we do now.|$|E
25|$|Unresponsive to Hartman's harsh discipline, Pyle is {{eventually}} assigned to Joker's squad. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing the recruits {{have failed to}} improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment {{for the rest of}} the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation for Pyle's failures, the platoon hazes him with a blanket party, restraining him in his bunk while beating him with bars of soap wrapped in <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> used like blackjacks. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as him talking to his M14 rifle.|$|E
25|$|The group {{moved over}} to the north end (La Salle side) after talks between Cojuangco and Letran Rector Fr. Regino Cortes. Only then did the Letran bleachers fill up. With the game on the way, Letran was toting a 22–18 lead when they called a {{time-out}} halfway through the first half; then, the south end reserve section (Letran side) erupted with at least five burly men (part of the guests of La Salle's team manager) ganging up on a hapless Letran high school sophomore student for a full minute before police could intervene. But for the mauled student, none was picked up (by the police). Almost simultaneously, the La Salle bench suddenly stood up, the players hunched and protecting their heads with <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> jackets against various missiles pelted on them.|$|E

25|$|Faint bloodstains in {{the main}} hallway of the {{apartment}} indicate {{at least one of}} the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom. The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, <b>towels,</b> <b>and</b> clothing. Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two machetes from the apartment, but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet <b>towels</b> <b>and</b> fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E
