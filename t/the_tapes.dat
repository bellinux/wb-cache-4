5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had the master tapes in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and intended to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to Wurpel and U2.|$|E
5|$|When the {{existence}} of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask Apple for at least £100,000. Williams said he later met with George Harrison and Starr to offer <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> for £5000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time. Williams and Taylor teamed up with Paul Murphy, head of Buk Records, to find an outlet for <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 1992, President Yeltsin {{handed the}} two {{recorder}} containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, but not <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted {{to reopen the}} KAL007 investigation {{in order to take}} the newly released information into account. <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> were handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over at the same time were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military. <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> were transcribed by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Some tapes may {{deteriorate}} {{because of}} a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> or <b>the</b> back coating on the reverse side, if <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was from any of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes the urethane to rise to <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. This problem {{became known as the}} 'sticky-shed syndrome'. One explanation was offered that short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> temporarily restores <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by driving <b>the</b> water molecules from the binder {{so that it can be}} safely copied to another tape or a different format. After baking, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> usually remains in good condition for approximately a month. If <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> re-deteriorates, it may be possible to bake <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads, instead of moving across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at almost 90° to {{the direction of}} motion as in the quadruplex system, move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> transport mechanism, allowing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
50|$|Tape baking is a {{somewhat}} risky procedure, {{since there is}} a risk of damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from <b>the</b> heat. However, there are some important signs that show when a <b>tape</b> needs baking. <b>The</b> typical symptom is squealing when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> passes <b>the</b> playback head or other fixed parts of a <b>tape</b> player. <b>The</b> squealing is audible directly from <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and also transmitted electronically through the output of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> recorder. Continuous use of a squealing tape risks permanently damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> as oxide is sometimes torn off <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This flaking residue can be seen and can feel gummy while still on <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. There is also a risk of damage to the player. Another symptom is <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> sounding dull and distorted. In a video recording, degradation can be represented by audio-visual dropouts.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> were {{originally}} {{described as having}} been recorded {{in the spring of}} 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone. However, song arrangements and dialogue from <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> pointed to late December 1962, and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited. Later researchers have proposed that <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> are from multiple days during the last week of December; Allan Williams (The Beatles' booking agent at the time) recalled that a total of about three hours was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the band}} {{recorded}} a demo tape on Compact Cassette which they sent to record {{companies in the}} hope of getting a recording contract. <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> are considered rarities.|$|E
50|$|Tabletop or desk {{dispensers}} {{are frequently}} {{used to hold}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and allow <b>the</b> operator {{to pull off the}} desired amount, tear <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> off, and take <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to <b>the</b> job.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> drive {{reversed}} <b>the</b> {{direction of}} <b>tape</b> motion, moved <b>the</b> read and write heads slightly vertically across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> and continued to write (or read) more data {{until the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was reached. This process could be repeated many times, laying down several track sets on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> media in a serpentine recording mode. The Storage Tek 9840, 9940 and T10000 drives are all serpentine recording drives.|$|R
50|$|With a reel turning at a {{constant}} rate, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> around <b>the</b> hub has a lower linear velocity than <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> outside of the reel, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers must slip past {{each other as they}} approach <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> was coated with a slippery backing material, usually graphite and patented by Bernard Cousino, to ease the continuous slip between <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers. While <b>the</b> design allowed simple, cheap, and mobile players, unlike a two-reel system, it did not permit rewinding of <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Some players offered fast-forward by speeding up the motor while cutting off the audio; but rewinding was never offered, because it was technically impossible.|$|R
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to the police, that the police had not asked for <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E
5000|$|Stiction {{may also}} {{manifest}} itself on computer tapes (9 track <b>tape</b> etc.). <b>The</b> magnetic surface of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> would be heated against the read head in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> deck, and when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> stopped moving would cool slightly and [...] "glue" [...] onto the read head. This {{could be avoided}} by configuring the software so that <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> could be read continuously.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> {{is totally}} {{enclosed}} {{when not in}} use. Unlike competing formats that have spaces in the cassette for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> loading mechanism to be inserted, thus exposing <b>the</b> delicate magnetic <b>tape</b> surface, VCCs have a retractable sheath that covers such space. The sheath is retracted as a tape is inserted into the machine and only then can <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> cover be raised to fully expose <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{shift left}} and shift right {{operations}} may shift <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> head across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> but when actually building a Turing machine {{it is more}} practical to make <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> slide back and forth under the head instead.|$|R
5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The band did not {{consider}} the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up to mix it. According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album. The band {{did not want the}} album to be released outside Japan and wanted full rights to <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> but it was released worldwide anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> passes across <b>the</b> erase head, which wipes any {{existing}} recording from <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{technique}} used in all transverse-scan video <b>tape</b> recorders, <b>the</b> recording heads are mounted {{in a rapidly}} spinning drum which is pressed against <b>the</b> moving <b>tape,</b> so <b>the</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows use of the entire width of <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> storing much more data per inch of <b>tape,</b> compared to <b>the</b> fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded {{along the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> through <b>the</b> capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel, and a cuing track.|$|R
50|$|Cassette tape {{players can}} cause skips when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> being played is worn {{or in some}} other way damaged. Since <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is rolled into a reel, it depends on how <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> runs across <b>the</b> roll as to how the skip affects playback. Indeed, some early artists such as the Beatles {{deliberately}} rearranged <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reels in order to produce loops used in their recordings.|$|R
5|$|Veronica {{realizes that}} Logan's letter was never found, and {{searches}} Lilly's room during {{a dinner party}} at the Kane's household. Duncan enters the room and they discover several videotapes which show Lilly {{having an affair with}} Logan's father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Veronica believes that Lilly found <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and refused to return them, which angered Aaron and he killed her; Duncan arrived home to find Lilly dead and had an epileptic fit, at which time Jake and Celeste returned home. While an unseen person watches them from a closet, Veronica calls Keith and tells him that she will bring home <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> noting that Aaron is at the party. Before she leaves, Veronica tells Duncan that they are not related. Meanwhile, Logan is drunk and stands on a bridge railing. Weevil and the PCHers arrive and they initiate a fight.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} attempt by The Beatles to block it, the 26-song Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 {{was released by}} Lingasong. The album first appeared in Germany in April 1977 in association with Bellaphon Records, and was released in the UK the following month. For the album's June 1977 US release (in association with Atlantic Records), four songs were removed and replaced with four different songs from <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} auto-reverse mechanism. As <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts pinch rollers. The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> other side of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> path.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> {{made its}} way into the hands of Vedder, who was working as a gas station {{attendant}} in San Diego, California at the time. He listened to <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. Vedder recorded vocals for three of the songs on <b>the</b> demo <b>tape,</b> one of which was [...] "Once", and mailed <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> back to Seattle. Upon hearing <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> band invited Vedder to come to Seattle and he was asked to join the band.|$|R
50|$|Travan uses {{a linear}} track technology, with data written onto {{individual}} tracks over several successive passes. Fully reading or writing a tape to full capacity may require moving <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from reel to reel many times. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is not {{attached to the}} hubs, but is wrapped and held by friction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is prevented from coming off at the ends using small holes punched in <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> which are detected by optical sensors in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive using a 45-degree mirror inside and {{a window on the}} side the cartridge.|$|R
5|$|Between August 2007 to March 2008, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso {{gathered}} interviews from 108 Tibetan individuals {{discussing the}} political situation, {{all of whom}} agreed to have their faces shown on camera. The pair gathered 40 hours of interview footage shot by a single camera. They had completed filming and just smuggled <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, when riots erupted and began to spread through Tibetan-majority areas of China. As {{part of the government}} response that followed, both Jigme Gyatso and Dhondup Wangchen were detained on 28 March in Tong De, Qinghai Province.|$|E
5|$|Dhondup Wangchen (born 17 October 1974) is a Tibetan filmmaker {{imprisoned by}} the Chinese {{government}} in 2008 on charges {{related to his}} documentary Leaving Fear Behind. Made with senior Tibetan monk Jigme Gyatso, the documentary consists of interviews with ordinary Tibetan people discussing the 14th Dalai Lama, the Chinese government, the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and Han Chinese migrants to the region. After smuggling <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> of the interviews out of Tibet, however, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso were detained during the 2008 Tibetan unrest.|$|E
5|$|Following these sessions, Norman went to Kingston, Jamaica {{and spent}} {{more than half a}} year there, working in the studio with Marley and {{composing}} songs. A number of his compositions were recorded by Marley, Peter Tosh, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and Neville Willoughby. Some of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> recorded by Norman during his sessions with Marley have been commercially released as part of the Marley compilation album, Soul Almighty.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all 1/2" [...] tape formats {{today are}} a single hub design, whereby <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is wound onto a single hub, entirely within the {{external}} shell and presents one end for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive to engage and thread into <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive for reading or writing. The mechanical design of this loading mechanism varies between {{different types of}} tape media and is a common source of failures. Usually <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> cartridge incorporates a switch that can be set to permit or forbid writing of data to <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{also uses}} an {{indirect}} tension-band drive system, consisting of an elastic band that presses {{on the exterior}} of both reels, and also over an idler wheel {{on the edge of}} the case. A motor in the drive contacts the idler to move <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Because <b>the</b> reels wind and unwind at unequal speeds there is always some slippage occurring when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is in motion; frequent retensioning of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> (achieved by winding <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> fully forwards and then backwards at high speed) is required to prevent this problem. Old tapes used many times tend to have a visibly marked stripe down the center of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> where <b>the</b> band has pressed into <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording <b>tape</b> through <b>the</b> mechanism of a <b>tape</b> recorder. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is threaded between the capstan {{and one or}} more rubber-covered wheels, called pinch rollers, which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> capstan is always placed downstream (in <b>the</b> direction of <b>tape</b> motion) from <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads. To maintain the required tension against <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads and other part of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> transport, {{a small amount of}} drag is placed on <b>the</b> supply reel. <b>Tape</b> recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no pinch rollers, the line simply being wound around them.|$|R
