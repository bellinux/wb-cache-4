5000|$|Optical spaces {{extend to}} {{infinity}} in all directions. The object space {{does not exist}} only on the [...] "input" [...] side of the system, nor the image space only on the [...] "output" [...] side. All optical spaces thus overlap completely. Typically, the origin and {{at least some of}} the coordinate axes of each space are different. It may not be possible to discern from an illustration to which space a point, ray, or plane belongs unless some convention is adopted. A common convention uses capital letters to label points and lower case letters to indicate distances. Unprimed letters indicate object space and primed letters image space. Intermediate spaces are indicated by additional primes. The same letter is used to indicate a conjugate relationship either between points or distances. The only exception is the use of F and F' <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>respectively</b> object and image space focal points (which are not conjugate). The term [...] "object point" [...] does not necessarily refer to a point on a specific object but rather to a point in object space; similarly for [...] "image point".|$|E

If the node does not have information to send, it will respond with a Null frame. Either way, the CH can detect when a node has finished sending the information it stored in its buffer and stop polling it during the current cycle. The member node can go to sleep at this time to further save energy. If all the member nodes go to sleep {{before the end of the}} activity window, the CH can follow suit. This approach is designed to save energy by avoiding collisions and idle listening as much as possible.|$|R

40|$|Arctic sea ice plays a {{key role}} in the climate system, by acting as the {{interface}} between a warm ocean and a cold atmosphere. Establishing the true pattern of recent behavior of the sea ice in this region is critical to simulating the role of sea ice in future climate. Recently released operational ice charts from the U. S. National Ice Center provide insight into the late twentieth century behavior of Northern Hemisphere sea ice, providing more reliable ice concentrations during summer and freeze-up than those available from the passive microwave record. The major winter and summer modes of ice concentration variability observed from empirical orthogonal function analysis covering the period 1972 – 1994 are shown <b>to</b> <b>indicate,</b> <b>respectively,</b> the 1 -year lagged response of the sea ice to the North Atlantic Oscillation and the winter preconditioning of summer sea ice coverage in the eastern Arctic by the North Atlantic Oscillation. Feedback to the atmosphere is suggested in each case by zero-lag cyclone frequency relationships to these two sea ice modes of variability...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{attention}} {{has been the subject}} of different metaphors including a spotlight (Posner, 1980), a zoom lens (Ericksen and St. James, 1986), and a gradient field (LaBerge, 1995; Downing and Pinker, 1985). This study proposes a novel paradigm to investigate the spatial distribution of visual attention. Simple reaction times (SRTs) to dots presented over the visual field were used to assess attentional allocation in space. We analyzed the data with several geostatistical methods. One of these, stochastic simulation, has been used in various fields, such as petroleum geology, hydrogeology, meteorology, and oceanography and seems to be particularly suitable for our purposes because it emphasizes spatial continuity patterns. Geostatistical stochastic simulation has the advantage of global precision, in other words it reproduces both the spatial variance and the statistical distribution characteristics of the phenomenon under study. As in any geostatistical method the basic tool is the variogram, which is used to predict data at any point within the domain. Simulations provide several different scenarios of equal probability, with the same spatial statistics of the original data. We used 5 different tasks and through SRTs we assessed attention (shorter or longer RTs were taken <b>to</b> <b>indicate,</b> <b>respectively,</b> higher or lower attentional focus). In experiment 1 participants were asked not to attend to any particular region, but rather try to spread their attention as uniformly as possible over the computer screen (diffuse attention). In the remaining experiments, subjects were instructed to direct their visual attention covertly to the center (experiment 2), to the left (experiment 3), to the right (experiment 4) or to both right and left, but not to the center, characterizing a divided attention situation (experiment 5) ...|$|E

30|$|Most of {{the multivariate}} {{statistical}} methods require variables {{to confirm the}} normal distribution, thus the normality {{of the distribution of}} each variable was checked by analyzing kurtosis and skewness statistical tests before multivariate statistical analysis is conducted (Lattin et al. 2003; Satheeshkumar and Khan 2012). The original tuna catch data and environmental data demonstrated values of kurtosis ranging from - 1.96 to 10.36 and skewness values ranging - 1.91 <b>to</b> 4.21 <b>indicating</b> that the data was not normally distributed. Since most of the values of kurtosis and skewness were > 0, the raw data of all variables were transformed in the form x’[*]=[*]log 10 (x).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the efficacy and {{side effects of}} the combined therapy of oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) and {{the survival of the}} patients. METHODS: Sixty-four patients (median age of 63 years) with histological or cytological confirmation of ESCC received oxaliplatin 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice daily on days 1 to 14 in a 21 -d treatment cycle as palliative chemotherapy. Each patient received at least two cycles of treatment. The efficacy, side effects and patient survival were evaluated. RESULTS: The partial response (PR) rate was 43. 8 % (28 / 64). Stable disease (SD) rate was 47. 9 % (26 / 64), and disease progression rate was 15. 6 % (10 / 64). The clinical benefit rate (PR + SD) was 84. 4 %. The main toxicities were leukopenia (50. 0 %), nausea and vomiting (51. 6 %), diarrhea (50. 0 %), stomatitis (39. 1 %), polyneuropathy (37. 5 %) and hand-foot syndrome (37. 5 %). No grade 4 event in the entire cohort was found. The median progression-free survival was 4 mo, median overall survival was 10 mo (95 % CI: 8. 3 - 11. 7 mo), and the 1 - and 2 -year survival rates were 38. 1 % and 8. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in southern Tunisia to determine the effect of irrigation regimes with saline water (3. 25 dS m - 1) on soil salinity, yield and water use efficiency of potato (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. Spunta) grown during autumn, winter and spring seasons. Irrigation treatments consisted in water replacements of accumulated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) at levels of 100 % (100 L) 80 % (80 L) 60 % (60 L) and 40 % (40 L), when the readily available water in the control treatment (100 L) is depleted. A daily irrigation regime at 100 % of ETc (100 D) was also used. Results show that salinity was lowest under emitters and highest midway to the margin of wetted bands. Under emitters it increased gradually between 100 and 40 L from 1. 0 to 2. 3 dS m - 1 in autumn, from 0. 65 to 1. 97 dS m - 1 in winter and from 0. 75 to 2. 55 dS m - 1 in spring. Highest ECe values were found to occur at about 20 and 10 cm from emitters, respectively for 100 and 40 L. Yields were highest under 100 L although no significant differences were observed with 100 D. From values of 30. 4, 22. 7 and 39. 6 t ha - 1, respectively for autumn winter and spring, yields decreased almost linearly when applied water was reduced. However, reduction in quality was significantly important for 60 and 40 L. The analysis outcome of the crop sensitivity <b>to</b> salt <b>indicated,</b> <b>respectively</b> for autumn, winter and spring seasons that thresholds are close to the value calculated from published salt tolerance data (1. 9, 1. 55, 1. 85 vs. 1. 7 dS m - 1) but the slopes are considerably steeper (34, 54, 47 vs. 12 %), apparently because of the combined effect of salinity and water stresses. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) reflected differences between seasons, it varied typically around 8 - 9, 6 - 8 and 11 - 14 kg m - 3, respectively for autumn, winter and spring. Full irrigation with daily application resulted in the lowest WUE values, most likely because of higher evaporative losses...|$|R

The V/Cr ratio in the GM 6 (1.27 – 1.75) and GM 7 (1.24 to 1.98, except one sample with value 2.13) cores are < 2 (Table 4), indicating an oxic condition. In addition, Ni/Co ratio[*]< 5 and[*]> 5 indicate oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively (Jones and Manning 1994). The Ni/Co ratios for the GM 6 and GM 7 cores range from 0.70 to 1.47 and from 0.65 <b>to</b> 1.73, <b>respectively,</b> <b>indicating</b> an oxic condition. Similarly, the Cu/Zn ratio {{is also a good}} paleo-redox indicator, which is always high (> 1) in the redox depositional condition (Goldberg and Humayun 2016). The Cu/Zn ratios in the GM 6 and GM 7 core sediments are < 1 (0.57 [*]±[*] 0.32 and 0.65 [*]±[*] 0.30, <b>respectively),</b> <b>indicating</b> an oxic condition. Wignall and Myers (1988) documented that the authigenic uranium (Uau[*]=[*]Total U – Th/ 3) values between 5 and 12 suggest an oxic depositional condition, whereas values > 12 are indicative of suboxic and anoxic conditions. The authigenic uranium values in GM 6 core range from −[*] 1.38 to 0.620 and for the GM 7 core, they vary from −[*] 1.57 to 0.231, suggesting an oxic depositional condition.|$|R
