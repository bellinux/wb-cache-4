5|$|During construction, which {{occurred}} during World War II, {{there were several}} modifications, delays and accidents during construction <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> trains being finished before the war ended; this was <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> finished trains {{to be able to}} assist the German occupation forces. The first three units were finished in 1945, and delivery was completed the following year. The class was originally numbered 106, but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956, and the class was renumbered to 66. The units consisted of three cars, given the lettering BFM, B and BS. They were numbered 66.01–04, 66.31–34 and 66.61–64, respectively; this numbering system dates from 1970.|$|E
