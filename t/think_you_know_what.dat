500|$|Warner Bros. {{requested}} {{in press}} releases that critics {{not discuss the}} film's ending. Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|By Spring 2014, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that Zhou's spheres of influence [...] the oil sector, Sichuan, the legal system, and his family members [...] were being methodically rounded up for investigation. However, {{in the absence of}} any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, [...] "like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets," [...] he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, [...] "this is really all I can say in response to your question, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean." [...] (...) Afterwards the assembled press gallery burst into laughter.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brand {{remained}} staring; he {{was even}} a little pale, {{as if he had}} been frightened. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are saying!" [...] he exclaimed.|$|E
5000|$|Brennan later {{hinted at}} {{the events that}} would unfold in the seventh season premiere: [...] "You cannot miss the first minute...You'll <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- rating. [...] "At a certain point, you’d think The Vampire Diaries would stop {{being able to}} pull off so many surprises. ... Yet somehow, they all work. If <b>you</b> ever <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> coming next, just accept it: You don’t. This is a very, very good thing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{understand}} what I mean, dearest. I will {{not think it}} dry and cruel, even though sorrow should come upon us, if you-- I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is true. Really, Lily, I {{believe you}} are the most likely person to do some good with her, though I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are in for. But Gillian does!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said. 'You {{must tell}} me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> later. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean? Not sloppy emotionalism. An impersonal union that leaves one free.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's {{the matter}} with her?' {{repeated}} Mrs. Davis. 'Well, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> {{the matter with}} her. You don't suppose she's made of stone, do you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, {{with an air}} of playful reproach, [...] "everybody plays cards nowadays, and I suppose {{one must}} not be too hard on you. Still, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> my views are upon that subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke's {{face was}} decidedly grim. [...] "I {{scarcely}} think I could. Rather more was said by {{both of us}} than could be very well rubbed off one's memory. Besides, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> kind of man he is?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's no good {{thinking}} of that now, my dear. What I particularly {{wanted to say to}} you was this: I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> <b>what</b> are the ideas which Lady Lufton entertains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{little girl}} of old days, Dick," [...] she said quietly, [...] "is {{in no way}} changed. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I thought of you, then. I have never for a moment wavered. I gave you all {{the love of my}} heart, and you have had it ever since.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Lufton means," [...] said Mrs. Robarts, [...] "that {{in asking}} you to talk openly to her of your affairs, she wishes you to {{remember}} that-- I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we mean," [...] said Mrs. Robarts, knowing very well herself what she did mean, but not knowing at all how to express herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a {{grievance}} the {{having to take}} to old ones {{has always been to}} him, poor little boy!' said Cherry, very nearly crying, for Bernard was so much her own child that in spite of his having cast her off she was in full instinct of defence; 'and he dislikes Lance's most of all, because of the Cathedral peculiarities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He says so; and I {{believe his}} word {{on such a}} subject sooner than yours. You are likely to quarrel without knowing it, and he is not. He <b>thinks</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> has become of Mountjoy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean," [...] he answered, {{avoiding}} her eyes. [...] "Your villagers {{will certainly}} think it strange {{to see their}} mistress walking with the poor missioner who wasn't allowed to hold his services." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> not. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> my father's {{feelings}} are, and I certainly {{shall not}} go {{out of my way}} to offend them. I have no animosity against Ralph; but I could do no good by opposing my father." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Merrifield caught some of {{the last}} words. 'No, my dear,' she said. 'That is not quite just or kind. It is being unhappy that makes poor Val so ready to cry about her own grievances. Only, Val, come here, and {{remember}} that fretting {{is not the way}} to meet such things. There is a better way, my child, and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean. Now, to help you through the time in an outer way, suppose you each set yourself some one thing to improve in while I am away. Don't tell me what it is, but let me find out when I come home.' With that she obeyed an urgent summons to speak to the gardener.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Clara," [...] he began, {{rising from}} his chair, and {{coming into the}} middle of the room, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> my wishes are." [...] Then he put his hand upon his heart. [...] "And your {{respected}} mother is the same way of thinking. It's that that emboldens me to be so sudden. Not but what my heart has been yours and yours only all along, before the old lady so much as mentioned it." [...] Clara would give him no assistance, not even the aid of a negative, but stood there quite passive, with her hand on the door. [...] "Since I first had the pleasure of seeing you I have always said to myself, 'Augustus Musselboro, that is the woman for you, if you can only win her.' But then there was so much against me,--wasn't there?" [...] She would not even take advantage of this by assuring him that there certainly always had been much against him, but allowed him to go on till he should run out all the length of his tether. [...] "I mean, of course, in the way of money," [...] he continued. [...] "I hadn't much that I could call my own when your respected mamma first allowed me to become acquainted with you. But it's different now; and I think I may say that I'm all right in that respect. Poor Broughton's going in this way will make it a deal smoother to me; and I may say that I and your mamma will be all in all to each other now about money." [...] Then he stopped.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no, Lily, not yet,' said Mr. Mohun, 'I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> quite <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> an intoxicating draught you had {{got hold}} of; I should have cautioned you. Your {{negligence}} {{has not yet}} been a serious fault, though remember, that it becomes so after warning.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times {{praised the}} film as [...] "an {{important}} history lesson that never feels like a lecture. Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take {{a field trip to}} see this movie." [...] Joe Morgenstern, writing for The Wall Street Journal, wrote: [...] "At its best, Ava DuVernay's biographical film honors Dr. King's legacy by dramatizing the racist brutality that spurred him and his colleagues to action." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the acting, directing, writing, and cinematography, and wrote: [...] "Even if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> coming, Selma hums with suspense and surprise. Packed with incident and overflowing with fascinating characters, it is a triumph of efficient, emphatic cinematic storytelling." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps you don't? No, Liz, I should <b>think</b> not. If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was, <b>you</b> {{would give}} me a very {{different}} answer. There; let go; be sensible. I wonder you don't remember that Mr Headstone is looking on.' ...|$|R
