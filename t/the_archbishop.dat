5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> still exists. The pope told <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect the rights of <b>the</b> <b>archbishop.</b> The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree {{that there was a}} deposition of the king supported by <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> at this time.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and <b>the</b> <b>archbishop,</b> urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by <b>the</b> <b>archbishop.</b> Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E
5|$|In the ecclesiastical {{administration}} of the Church of England the entire North is covered by the Province of York, which is represented by <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York – the second-highest figure in the Church after <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury. The unusual situation of having two archbishops {{at the top of}} Church hierarchy suggests that Northern England was seen as a sui generis. Likewise, with the exception of parts of the Diocese of Shrewsbury and Diocese of Nottingham, the North is covered in Roman Catholic Church administration by the Province of Liverpool, represented by <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Liverpool.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>archbishops</b> of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from {{an early}} date, {{certainly}} {{by the time of}} the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop's</b> manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop's</b> staff in <b>the</b> early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224.|$|R

These include <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Westminster, Countess Mountbatten of Burma and Michael Buerk. In 2008 the BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan and Daily Mail columnist Des Kelly both became Patrons of the England Blind Football team.|$|E
5|$|The next year, <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> {{refused to}} crown Eustace and was again exiled by Stephen, who was {{attempting}} to secure the succession for his son by imitating the Capetian dynasty of France, which usually saw the king's heir crowned during his father's lifetime. Although Theobald claimed papal authority for refusal, based on the prohibition by Celestine, it was more probable {{that he and the}} bishops had no desire to prolong the civil war. Stephen demanded in April 1152 that Theobald crown Eustace, but <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> once again refused, and went into exile in Flanders. Theobald claimed that Stephen had gained the throne through perjury, implying that if <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> crowned Eustace, Theobald would be perpetuating this crime. The king and <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> reached a truce in August.|$|E
5000|$|Pius VI {{replied to}} the [...] in 1789. Pius VI refuted all the {{arguments}} of <b>the</b> <b>archbishops</b> against papal nunciatures, argued it was wrong for <b>the</b> <b>archbishops</b> to rebel against papal authority, explained that the pope cannot send representatives to states who {{have no right to}} pass judgment on ecclesiastical affairs, and admonished <b>the</b> <b>archbishops</b> to give up their untenable position towards the Holy See.|$|R

5|$|After {{his victory}} at Hastings, William {{expected}} {{to receive the}} submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, {{with the support of}} Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury, and Ealdred, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of Kent to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark, but being unable to storm London Bridge he sought to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.|$|E

5|$|After {{the bishops}} refused to pass judgment, the barons {{attempted}} to do so, but Becket refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission. Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to Becket and suggested a compromise, which Becket refused. Becket went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in Flanders on 2November 1164. Foliot was sent, along with Roger, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York, Hilary of Chichester, Bartholomew Iscanus, the Bishop of Exeter, Roger of Worcester, the Bishop of Worcester, William d'Aubigny, the Earl of Arundel, {{and a group of}} royal clerks, to Thierry the Count of Flanders, Louis VII the King of France, and Pope Alexander III. Their mission was to prevent <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> from being given refuge, but despite their efforts Louis of France agreed to grant Becket refuge. Foliot's delegation met with more success at the papal court; although they did not succeed in securing a decision in the king's favour, neither did the pope side with <b>the</b> <b>archbishop.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Edward I, the new king, Edward II, asked that Winchelsey be restored, which the pope agreed to on 22 January 1308. Soon after his return to England in early 1308 <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> joined the king's enemies. <b>The</b> <b>archbishop,</b> along with the Earl of Warwick, {{were the only people}} to object to the return of the new king's {{favourite}} Piers Gaveston to England in 1309. Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to excommunication. He was appointed an Ordainer in 1310, and died at Otford on 11 May 1313.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{presided over}} the {{organisation}} of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> quarrelled, but {{the exact nature of}} their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{treatment}} of David I and the Scottish church usually emphasises David's pioneering {{role as the}} instrument of diocesan reorganisation and Norman penetration, beginning with the bishopric of Glasgow while David was Prince of the Cumbrians, and continuing further north after David acceded to the throne of Scotland. Focus too is usually given to {{his role as the}} defender of the Scottish church's independence from claims of overlordship by <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York and <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1170, de Broc was {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} keep Becket from returning to England. Working with de Broc were Roger de Pont L'Évêque– <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York, Gilbert Foliot– the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon– the Bishop of Salisbury, Gervase de Cornhill– the Sheriff of Kent, and Reginald de Warenne. De Broc was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> returned to England. The group, led by Gervase of Cornhill, complained that Becket was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the three excommunicated ecclesiastics, but nothing was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options.|$|E
