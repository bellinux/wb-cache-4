5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> would be struck by another tornado.|$|E

Born in Melbourne, he was a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before joining the Air Force in December 1930. After serving in instructional and general flying roles, he took command of No.3 Squadron in December 1939, leading it into action in the Middle East less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b> Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he returned to Australia in 1942 to command air bases in Canberra and Melbourne. The following year he was posted to the South West Pacific, where he led successively Nos.71 and 73 Wings. Having been promoted to group captain, he took charge of Southern Area Command in 1944, and No.81 Wing in the Dutch East Indies the following year.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Joseph Eric (Joe) Hewitt, CBE (13 April 1901– 1November 1985) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

In 1943, he took command of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E

Some authors claim that this than had all the major {{features}} of a sattra (central kirtanghar, cari-hati etc.), whereas many others assert that these features did not exist during Sankardev's time. This than was abandoned and more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>later</b> {{in the middle of}} the 17th-century, Sankardev's granddaughter-in-law, Kanaklata, established it again.|$|R

5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik {{at the southern end of}} the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b> The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is not clear whether Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
