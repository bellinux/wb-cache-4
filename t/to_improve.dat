40|$|Abstract Background This study’s {{purpose was}} to {{understand}} associations between water, sanitation, and child growth. Methods We estimated stunting (height-for-age Z score[*]<− 2 SD) and thinness (BMI-Z[*]<− 2 SD) risk ratios using data from 7, 715 Ethiopian, Indian, Peruvian, and Vietnamese children from the Young Lives study. Results In unadjusted models, household access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water and toilets was often associated with reduced stunting risk.  After adjusting for child, household, parent, and community variables, access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water was usually not associated with stunting nor thinness except in Ethiopia where access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water was associated with reduced stunting and thinness at 1 y and 5 y. In contrast, in both unadjusted and adjusted models, stunting at 1 y was less common among children with good toilet access than among those without access and this difference persisted when children were 5 y and 8 y. For example, in adjusted estimates, Vietnamese 5 y olds with access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> toilets had relative stunting risk at 8 y 0. 62 - 0. 68 that of 5 y olds with no access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> toilets. Water and toilets were rarely associated with thinness. Conclusions Results from our study indicate that access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> sanitation is more frequently associated with reduced stunting risk than access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water. However, additional studies are needed before drawing definitive conclusions {{about the impact of}} toilets relative to water. This study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate the robust and persistent importance of access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> toilets in infancy, not only during the first year but continuing into childhood. Additional longitudinal investigations are needed to determine concurrent and long-term associations of WASH with stunting and thinness...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{characterize}} household trends in access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water sources and sanitaton in Chi Linh Town, Hai Duong Province, Vietnam, {{and to identify}} factors affecting those trends. Method: Data were extracted from the Chi Linh Health and Demographic Surveillance System (CHILILAB HDSS) database from 2004 – 2014, which included household access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water sources, household access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> sanitation, and household demographic data. Descriptive statistical analysis and multinominal logistic regression were used. The results showed that over a 10 -year period (2004 – 2014), the proportion of households with access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water and improved sanitation increased by 3. 7 % and 28. 3 %, respectively. As such, the 2015 Millennium Development Goal targets for safe drinking water and basic sanitation were met. However, 13. 5 % of households still had unimproved water and sanitation. People who are retired, work in trade or services, or other occupations were 1. 49, 1. 97, and 1. 34 {{times more likely to}} have access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water and sanitation facilities than farming households, respectively (p < 0. 001). Households living in urban areas were 1. 84 times more likely than those living in rural areas to have access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water sources and improved sanitation facilities (OR = 1. 84; 95 % CI = 1. 73 – 1. 96). Non-poor households were 2. 12 {{times more likely to have}} access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water sources and improved sanitation facilities compared to the poor group (OR = 2. 12; 95 % CI = 2. 00 – 2. 25). More efforts are required to increase household access <b>to</b> both <b>improved</b> water and sanitation in Chi Linh Town, focusing on the 13. 5 % of households currently without access. Similar to situations observed elsewhere in Vietnam and other low- and middle- income countries, there is a need to address socio-economic factors that are associated with inadequate access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> water sources and sanitation facilities...|$|R

Background: Access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> drinking-water source and sanitation facilities has been immensely influencing the health and well being of people. Method: This was an observational cross-sectional study. The study population comprised of housewives residing in urban area and attending the outpatient department of Urban Health Training Centre of a Medical College in Pune city. Our study used the definition given by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for "improved" drinking-water source and "improved" sanitation facility. Data was analysed from 369 households in an urban area of Pune. Statistical analysis used: Proportion with confidence interval and chi square test. P value less than 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Result and conclusion: 95. 7 % of the urban study population had access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> drinking water source. 54. 2 % of the urban study population had access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> sanitation facility. The odds of a pucca house with access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> sanitation were found to be more than 2 times as compared to a Kutcha house having access <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> sanitation facility.
