40|$|Objectives: The {{impact of}} {{preoperative}} endoscopic therapy on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy on long-term outcome {{has not been}} determined. This study was undertaken to determine whether preoperative therapy impacts <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy and whether preoperative therapy or <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> myotomy impacts long-term outcomes. Methods: Since 1992, 305 patients, 56 % male, median age 49 years, underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy and were prospectively followed. <b>The</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy was scored by the operating surgeon for the most recent 170 consecutive patients {{on a scale of}} 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult). Patients scored their symptoms before and after myotomy using a Likert scale from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Results: Before myotomy, 66 % of patients underwent endoscopic therapy: 33 % dilation, 11 % Botox, and 22 % both. Preoperative endoscopic therapy did not correlate with <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy (P�NS). Median follow-up was 25 months. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy, dysphagia improved with myotomy (P� 0. 0001). By regression analysis, the frequency and severity of postmyotomy dysphagia correlated with neither preoperative endoscopic therapy nor <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy...|$|R

The model is tested by two experiments, each of which involves estimating <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> puzzles taken from The New York Times. Additionally, we discuss how the notion of information implicit in our model relates to more easily quantifiable types of information that figure into crossword puzzles. ...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to Barsalou's, Damasio's, Glenberg's, Prinz' and others' work, neo-empiricism {{is gaining}} a {{deserved}} {{recognition in the}} psychology and philosophy of concepts. I argue, however, that neo-empiricists have underestimated <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> providing evidence against the amodal approach to concepts and higher cognition. I highlight three key problems: <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> sorting out amodal predictions from neo-empiricist predictions, <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> finding experimental tasks that are not best solved by imagery and <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> generalizing findings concerning a given cognitive process in a given context to other cognitive processes or other contexts. Finally, solutions to these three problems are considered. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver resections are related to both patient and tumour factors, however <b>the</b> available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems only incorporate tumour factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the opinion of laparoscopic liver surgeons regarding the factors that affect <b>the</b> perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver resections. METHOD: Using a Visual Analogue Scale an international survey of laparoscopic liver surgeons was undertaken to assess <b>the</b> perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> 26 factors previously demonstrated to affect <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> a laparoscopic liver resection. RESULTS: 80 surgeons with a combined experience of over 7000 laparoscopic liver resections responded to <b>the</b> survey. <b>The</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver surgery was suggested to be increased by a BMI > 35 by 89 % of respondents; neo-adjuvant chemotherapy by 79 %; repeated liver resection by 99 % and concurrent procedures by 59 % however these factors have not been included in <b>the</b> previous <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems. CONCLUSION: The results suggests that <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver surgery is not fully assessed by <b>the</b> available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems and prompts the development <b>of</b> a new <b>difficulty</b> score that incorporates all factors believed to increase difficulty. </p...|$|R

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E

Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.|$|E

Duncan Garrow has pointed to <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration.

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> {{adequate}} diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as}} the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> a child with the identified gene.|$|E
