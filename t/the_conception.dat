The series' premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> of the title character. The series' executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in Century City.|$|E

5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} {{consciousness of}} effective groups of researchers is characterised by shared understandings {{of their research}} object or territory. In the relatively new field of information technology research, rapid expansion and fragmentation of the territory has led to different perceptions about what constitutes information technology research. This project explores a facet of the collective consciousness of disparate groups of researchers and lays a foundation for constructing shared research objects. Making IT researchers’ ways of seeing explicit may help us {{understand some of the}} complexities associated with inter and intra disciplinary collaboration amongst research groups, and the complexities associated with technology transfer to industry. This report analyses IT research, its objects and territories, as they are constituted by IT researchers associated with the sub-disciplines of information systems, computer science and information security. A phenomenographic approach is used to elicit data from a diverse range of IT researchers in semistructured interviews. This data is analysed to show (1) the variation in meaning associated with the idea of IT research and (2) the awareness structures through which participants experience variation in ways of seeing the object and territories of IT research. An Outcome Space represents the interrelation between different ways of seeing the territory. Eight ways of seeing IT research, its objects and territories, were found: <b>The</b> Technology <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Information <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Information and Technology <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Communication <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Ubiquitous <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Sanctioned <b>Conception,</b> <b>The</b> Dialectic <b>Conception</b> and <b>The</b> Constructed <b>Conception.</b> These are described in detail and illustrated with participants’ quotes.

5|$|Vector spaces {{stem from}} affine {{geometry}} via {{the introduction of}} coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve.

His work was then used in <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> of barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827. In 1828 C. V.
