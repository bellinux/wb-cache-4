Second, integer variables with <b>too</b> a <b>small</b> variation are disregarded in the global step-size update alltogether. This prevents random fluctuations of the step-size...|$|R

To design floating structure {{first step is}} hydrodynamic analysis under wave effect. As the depth of {{structure is}} <b>too</b> <b>smaller</b> than the other dimensions, this structure behaves elastically. Hydroelastic analysis is used to obtain its deformation under wave action. Reduction of the hydroelastic responses may increase serviceability and safety. There {{are many ways to}} reduce the hydroelastic response of VLFS.
