25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} with pieces of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a <b>transparent</b> <b>glass</b> tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar so that it is visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Dyson {{created a}} {{realisation}} of the optical illusions {{depicted in the}} lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task {{after a year of}} work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading {{to the bottom of the}} next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden, was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003. The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the <b>transparent</b> <b>glass</b> ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.|$|E
25|$|A box cooker has a <b>transparent</b> <b>glass</b> {{or plastic}} top, {{and it may}} have {{additional}} reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|E

Kamin was pleased with Piano's South Pavilions, describing them as [...] "minor modernist jewels, almost house-like". He lauded the way their limestone walls complement the <b>transparent</b> <b>glass</b> by way of contrast, and noted that they anticipated Piano's then-forthcoming addition to the Art Institute of Chicago Building.

500|$|Also in 2015, a Mediated Matter team {{developed}} G3DP, {{the first}} 3D printer for optically <b>transparent</b> <b>glass.</b> At the time, sintering 3D printers could print with glass powder, {{but the results}} were brittle and opaque. G3DP was designed in collaboration with MIT's Glass Lab and the Wyss Institute, emulating traditional glass working processes. Molten glass was poured in fine streams and cooled in an annealing chamber, yielding precision suitable for art and consumer products, and glass strength suitable for architectural elements. The process allowed close control of color, transparency, thickness and texture. Changing the height and speed of the nozzle produced uniform loops, turning the printer into a [...] "molden glass sewing machine". A set of glass vessels made with this printer went on exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt and other museums, and a 10-foot tall sculpture of light and printed glass, YET, was designed for the 2017 Milan Design Week.|$|E

500|$|Post-production was {{severely}} delayed when Gilliam {{disagreed with the}} Weinsteins over the final cut privilege. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam {{had enough time to}} shoot another feature film, Tideland. To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that Peerless [...] "ran into a number of major issues with The Brothers Grimm and with the Weinstein Brothers". He continued that [...] "the main problem {{was the fact that the}} number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects." [...] Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit.

500|$|The {{original}} quadraphonic mix, {{created by}} Alan Parsons, {{was commissioned by}} EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD. [...] Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was [...] "possibly a little too true to the original mix", but was generally complimentary. [...] The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000copies. The cover image was created {{by a team of}} designers including Storm Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. <b>Transparent</b> <b>glass,</b> held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the [...] "sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound..."
