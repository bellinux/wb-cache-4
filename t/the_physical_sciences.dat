5|$|Bath has two universities, the University of Bath and Bath Spa University. Established in 1966, the University of Bath {{was named}} University of the Year by The Sunday Times (2011). It offers {{programs}} in politics, languages, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences,</b> engineering, mathematics, architecture, management and technology.|$|E
5|$|An atomic {{line filter}} (ALF) is an {{advanced}} optical band-pass filter used in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences</b> for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision, accuracy, and minimal signal strength loss. Atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic vapors and so {{may also be}} designated an atomic resonance filter (ARF).|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} graduate schools and committees {{are divided into}} five divisions: Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and the Institute for Molecular Engineering. In the autumn quarter of 2015, the university enrolled 3,588 graduate students: 438 in the Biological Sciences Division, 801 in the Humanities Division, 1,102 in <b>the</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> Division, 1,165 in the Social Sciences Division, and 52 in the Institute for Molecular Engineering.|$|E

5|$|From its {{founding}} until through early 1920s, the university grew rapidly. It offered programs in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences</b> and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added {{one of the}} first architecture programs in the U.S. In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree, and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. SU created its first doctoral program in 1911. SU's school of journalism, now the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, was established at Syracuse in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science {{degrees in}} 51 {{academic}} majors and 33 minors. The college's academics {{are divided into}} five divisions: the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, <b>the</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> Collegiate Division, the Social Sciences Collegiate Division, the Humanities Collegiate Division, and the New Collegiate Division. The first four are sections within their corresponding graduate divisions, while the New Collegiate Division administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit {{in one of the}} other four divisions.|$|E
5|$|The Institute is {{traditionally}} {{known for its}} research and education in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences</b> and engineering, but more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. MIT {{is a member of}} the Association of American Universities (AAU). For several years, MIT's School of Engineering has been ranked first in various international and national university rankings, while MIT is also often ranked among the world's top universities overall. The MIT Engineers compete in 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, whereas the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences)</b> to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was {{established}} in 1966. It is known, academically, for <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences,</b> mathematics, architecture, management and technology. Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences. The city contains one further education college, City of Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%. Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical Transactions is {{the oldest}} and longest-running {{scientific}} journal in the world, having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sciences,</b> and B, which deals with the biological sciences. Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts. Biology Letters publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross-disciplinary research at {{the boundary between the}} physical and life sciences, while Interface Focus, publishes themed issue in the same areas. Notes and Records is the Society's journal on the history of science. Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. Open Biology is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level. Royal Society Open Science is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer-review. All the society's journals are peer-reviewed.|$|E
