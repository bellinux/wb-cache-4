5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the run that featured it was <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak about the Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> the banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E

5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, {{turned on his}} brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of the}} country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

However, Cook himself always maintained he had no ambitions at all for sustained success. He assessed happiness by his friendships and his enjoyment of life.

The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or corrective statements, but many are long and elaborate treatises.|$|E
25|$|Included {{category}} (I) diamonds have obvious inclusions {{that are}} clearly visible to a trained grader under 10x magnification. Included diamonds have inclusions {{that are usually}} visible without magnification or have inclusions that threaten the durability of the stone. The I category {{is divided into three}} grades; I1 denotes a higher clarity grade than I2, which in turn is higher than I3. Inclusions in I1 diamonds often are seen by the unaided eye. I2 inclusions are easily seen, while I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> lead crystal {{relies on}} the high {{refractive}} index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.|$|E

25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. <b>The</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> the CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|E
25|$|Keeton {{returned}} to fitness {{in time for}} the 1936 season and if this was not one of his more outstanding seasons, in that his average was in the mid-30s and his highest score was only 115, he still scored more runs than anyone else for Nottinghamshire. He repeated that in 1937 when his average rose to 45 and his aggregate passed 2000 runs for the season again, though for Nottinghamshire he and the other batsmen were overshadowed by <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> Joe Hardstaff junior who averaged 66 runs per innings in county games. Among highlights for Keeton in 1937 was a series of innings in which he scored three centuries, plus other scores of 99 not out and 97, in the course of eight matches. He was not, however, called in for any of the Test matches against the New Zealand side when the England selectors blooded several new players.|$|E

Lester turned the ball into his own net to bring the scores level, but despite <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> Bob Holmes, playing on his own at back after Sandy Tait had gone in goal, Preston could not prevent Small Heath exploiting their numerical advantage. The third goal ended with ball, goalkeeper and all five Small Heath forwards in the net, after which Jones scored twice to make the final score 5–2. Walton, now playing at centre half, drew particular praise for his judgment and the quality of his passing. The two points gained took Small Heath off the bottom of the table for the first time.|$|E
