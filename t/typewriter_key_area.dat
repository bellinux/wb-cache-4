50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of PostScript, printers were designed to print character output given the text - typically in ASCII - as input. There were a number of technologies for this task, but most shared the property that the glyphs were physically difficult to change, as they were stamped onto <b>typewriter</b> <b>keys,</b> bands of metal, or optical plates.|$|R

Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110inches (2.79mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a half-inch thick.|$|R

50|$|Each {{row of keys}} is {{differentiated}} {{from the}} one above and the one below by a different tactile feel: the even rows have round and raised keys and the odd rows have flat and oblong keys.

Plastic keys were also introduced very early on but their rows do not have that tactile difference.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike other {{machines}} of its day, internal data was represented in hexadecimal {{as opposed to}} octal, but being a very inexpensive machine it used the physical <b>typewriter</b> <b>keys</b> that correspond to positions 10 to 15 in the type basket for the six non-decimal characters (as opposed to a - f) to represent those values, resulting in 0 - 9 f g j k q w, which was remembered using the phrase [...] "FiberGlass Javelins Kill Quite Well".|$|R
5000|$|The Electromatic {{typewriter}} patents {{document the}} use of pivoted spiral cams operating against a hard rubber drive roller to drive the print mechanism. [...] This was the foundation of essentially all later electric typewriters. The typewriter could be equipped with a [...] "remote control" [...] mechanism allowing one typewriter to control another or to record and play back typed data through a parallel data connection with one wire per <b>typewriter</b> <b>key.</b> [...] The electromatic tape perforator, used a wide tape, with punch position per key on the keyboard.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{implementing}} an electromechanical keyboard {{that produced}} an ASCII encoding but had conventional <b>typewriter</b> <b>key</b> mappings would require significant complexity due to key-specific shift mechanisms for digits and symbol keys. This {{could be avoided}} by changing the key mappings to correspond to the ASCII table, which was notably done in the Teletype Model 33 (1963). Later keyboards continued to use this mapping, which was formalized in the American Standards Association X4.14-1971 standard, where it {{is referred to as}} logical bit pairing, and contrasted with typewriter pairing. In everyday usage these were referred to as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards.|$|R

5000|$|The {{scientific}} calculator with speech output for blind students. Aitchison's passion {{in his later}} years at Macquarie University was the development of the Speakwriter, a typewriter which enunciated the sounds of <b>typewriter</b> <b>keys</b> as they were pressed. An article written by Tony Healy in Computing Australia (1/9/86) quotes Tim Connell now working for Quantum Technology: “We saw Professor Aitchison on TV with his (talking) typewriter and realised we could do that.” Aitchison developed the talking typewriter originally to help a blind student complete a standard science course. His ideas can now be seen in many of the products available today made for people with vision impairment.|$|R

5000|$|AZERTY [...] is a {{specific}} layout for the characters of the Latin alphabet on <b>typewriter</b> <b>keys</b> and computer keyboards. The layout {{takes its name from}} the first six letters to appear on the first row of alphabetical keys. Like the German QWERTZ layout, it is modelled on the English QWERTY layout. It is used by most French speakers based in Europe, though France and Belgium each have their own national variations on the layout. Luxembourg and Switzerland use the Swiss QWERTZ keyboard. Most of the residents of Quebec, the mainly French-speaking province of Canada, use a QWERTY keyboard that has been adapted to the French language such as the Multilingual Standard keyboard CAN/CSA Z243.200-92 which is stipulated by the government of Quebec and the Government of Canada.|$|R
50|$|A one-bit {{mechanical}} actuator assumes two positions: one when on, another when off. The motion of several one-bit actuators {{can be combined}} and weighted with a whiffletree mechanism to produce finer steps. The IBM Selectric typewriter uses such as system. When a <b>typewriter</b> <b>key</b> is pressed, it moves a metal bar (interposer) down that has several lugs. The lugs are the information bits. When a key is pressed, its interposer is moved by the motor. If a lug is present at one position, it will move the corresponding selector bail (bar); if the lug is not present, the selector bail stays where it is. The discrete motions of the bails are combined by a whiffle tree, and the output controls the rotation and tilt of the Selectric's typeball.|$|R
