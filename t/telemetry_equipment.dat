500|$|Since 1991, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) has {{maintained}} a seismic recording station [...] east of Hualālai's summit to monitor the volcano. During this time, not a single earthquake swarm or harmonic tremor, indicative of activity at the volcano, has occurred. Although Hualālai does experience several magnitude 4 earthquakes per year, these are attributed to a deep source {{off the coast of}} the north-western rift zone and are not related to the movement of magma. The USGS is currently in the process of upgrading its aging monitoring and <b>telemetry</b> <b>equipment,</b> using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. The agency plans to add another seismometer and three more sensors to help monitor activity. In addition, the HVO uses GPS to measure slight changes in tilt and slope of Hualālai, indicative of magmatic movement. A survey has been conducted every two years since 1986, but [...] changes have been recorded.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Megamile {{communications}} {{call for}} the fullest use of advanced modern technology. This paper surveys {{the design of a}} deep-space communication system. The basic constraints and capabilities of a low-noise ground receiving system are covered in detail, including antenna temperature contributions from galactic noise, tropospheric and ionospheric attenuation, and earth radiation through antenna side lobes. Low-noise preamplifiers, large high-gain antennas, and narrow-band phase-lock receivers are also considered. Digital biphase modulation, used in Pioneer V, is compared with more sophisticated bi-orthogonal coding systems. Both types of coding systems are compared with error rate as a parameter, with the ideal error-free Shannon limit. The design of Pioneer V and its record of achievement are described.
