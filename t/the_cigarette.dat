5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. <b>The</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully use the X-Files {{office to}} find <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man's real identity, {{that he is}} Agent Spender's father, C.G.B. Spender. Their {{unauthorized}} entry at the X-Files office is discovered resulting in both agents' immediate suspension from the FBI. Agent Spender reports to <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man demanding the truth. Scully meets with Mulder, telling him that C.G.B. Spender is likely another alias and that the man is linked with Mulder's father, William, who he had worked with on a secret state project. <b>The</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man decides to give Agent Spender more responsibility by having him kill the alien rebel masquerading as a Syndicate elder. Spender fails in his task, but Krycek comes to his aid and finishes. Krycek reveals to Spender {{that his father was}} responsible for Cassandra's abductions and that his role is to protect his father's stake in the project, facts that upset Agent Spender.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cigarettes</b> have a {{smell of}} plums and are purported to have been <b>the</b> {{preferred}} <b>cigarette</b> brand of Mao Zedong. The Chunghwa brand {{can be considered a}} status symbol, and <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are often given as gifts.|$|R
5000|$|Tobacco company Brown & Williamson, former {{makers of}} Kool cigarettes, began {{producing}} Avalon in 1932. Avalon was Brown & Williamson's 'economy' brand, while never actually mentioning that term. Instead, they were promoted as either <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> that [...] "cost you less" [...] or <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> that [...] "give you change back".|$|R

5|$|Alex Krycek {{reports to}} the Syndicate on the rebel's recent attacks. The rebel, {{masquerading}} as the elder he killed, proposes that the Syndicate align themselves with the rebels. <b>The</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man seems {{to recognize that the}} elder has opposed his own previous opinion- that siding with the rebels is suicide.|$|E
5|$|At another crop outpost in Tunisia, <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder {{remains a}} threat, as he {{explains}} what Mulder has {{found out about the}} virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened.|$|E

60|$|It {{was through}} no fault of mine (for I rolled <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> tight and smooth), but the upshot of some whim of his own, that instead of to an Odyssey of the chaparral, I listened to--a {{dissertation}} upon matrimony! This from Buck Caperton! But I maintain that <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were impeccable, and crave absolution for myself.|$|R

5|$|In {{the scene}} in which the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his {{cigarette}} at McManus' face. The scene was originally to have Redfoot flick <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction is genuine.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under scrutiny. News outlets reported that LaBeouf's comic books, Let's Fucking Party and Stale N Mate, had been plagiarized from Benoît Duteurtre's The Little Girl and <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> and Charles Bukowski's Assault.|$|E
5|$|As {{the factory}} bell rings, <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> girls emerge and {{exchange}} banter with {{young men in}} the crowd ("La cloche a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were {{available}} in tins and the original cardboard container was a four sided tray of cigarettes that slid out from a covering like a classic matchbox. The next design had fold in ends so that <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> could be seen or dispensed without sliding out the tray. In the 1950s the packaging moved to the flip top design like most brands.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "Pianissimo" [...] {{refers to}} the musical {{dynamics}} and volumes of sounds or notes. The word pêche is a French term meaning [...] "peach," [...] {{as well as the}} peach taste that <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> contain. Produced and sold almost exclusively in Japan, <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are sold as 20 Cigarettes Per Pack, 10 Packs Per Carton, and 200 Cigarettes Per Carton.|$|R
5|$|Other {{immediate}} {{tax increases}} in the budget included an increase in <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> tax by $0.175 per pack; a 0.4% surcharge on automobile purchases of over $45,000.00 and on vehicles with an average combined city highway miles per gallon 19 or less; a new 6% tax on fur clothing; {{an increase in the}} rental-car tax from $2 to $5 per day; and increases on several business taxes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man reveals {{everything}} to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him. Mulder tells Skinner that Cassandra {{is in danger}} because {{she is the first}} successful alien-human hybrid; Skinner goes to the hospital to check on Cassandra but finds her gone. Cassandra, having escaped from the hospital, arrives at Mulder's apartment and demands that he shoot her because she is the embodiment of fifty years of work by the Syndicate— an alien-human hybrid that will trigger colonization if the aliens learn of her existence.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of Directors {{was founded}} in 1903 and {{received}} a royal charter in 1906. The former branch of the Midland Bank at Nos.69–70 Pall Mall was designed by Edwin Lutyens and constructed between 1922 and 1927. The original plan to redevelop No.70 proved impractical so the two premises were demolished to provide a site for the current premises. <b>The</b> <b>cigarette</b> manufacturer Rothmans have their head office at No65 Pall Mall, in a building designed by Norman Shaw, while P Ferries' main administrative office is at No79.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{possession}} of any cigarettes was relevant {{to whether or}} not she was being truthful, and since she had been caught in the bathroom and taken directly to the office, it was reasonable to assume she had <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in her purse. Thus, the vice-principal had reasonable cause to suspect a school rule had been broken, and more than just a [...] "hunch" [...] to search the purse. When the vice-principal was searching for <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>the</b> drug-related evidence was in plain view. Plain view is an exception to the warrant requirement of the 4th Amendment. Thus, the reasonable search for cigarettes led to some of the drug related material being discovered, which justified a search (including the zippered compartments inside the bag) resulting in the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and other evidence including a small bag of marijuana and cigarette rolling papers.|$|R
5|$|The {{actions of}} Graham and Macdonnell {{continue}} {{to be remembered as}} an iconic moment in the battle of Waterloo. In 1915, cigarette manufacturers W.D. & H.O. Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and even if they include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing of the gate to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E
5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest that it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Chappell {{spent two}} years as a clerk in a sharebroker's office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a {{promotions}} representative for Nestlé and, later, <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann. In recent years, Chappell has been a high-profile activist for better treatment of asylum seekers by the Australian government, in particular its policy of mandatory detention. He supports Australia cutting ties with the United Kingdom and becoming a republic, being {{a founding member of}} the Australian Republican Movement.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> flavour.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} FBI {{headquarters}} and types out a resignation letter that he hands into Skinner. Skinner visits his office as Mulder is packing his things, and relates an out-of-body experience {{he had in}} Vietnam. Skinner refuses to accept Mulder's resignation and Mulder realizes {{that he was the}} one who provided him with <b>the</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man's location. Heading to the parking garage, Mulder is met by X, telling him that he'll have a chance for revenge that night when men, believing him to have information on Scully, will search his apartment at a specific time. Mulder is waiting with his gun at his apartment when Melissa arrives. Although he initially refuses to leave, Melissa is able to convince Mulder to see Scully. While being with Scully, Mulder holds Scully's left hand and talks to her. Returning home to find his apartment trashed, Mulder sits on the floor and cries.|$|E
