500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you {{to say nothing of}} your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>yourself</b> a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>yourself</b> healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
