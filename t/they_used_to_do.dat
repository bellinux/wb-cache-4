Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Duncan and Meg (Alona Tal) {{approach}} Veronica, and {{she tells}} Meg the general overview of a case where someone has been evading capture and all the tactics <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so before Duncan suddenly leaves. Wallace gives Veronica the student file {{on one of the}} two students, but his high school records are clean after bullying in junior high. The other student doesn't have a file. Veronica talks to Duncan, who says he knows about her investigation. Duncan scoffs at her findings before he realizes that she suspects him in the murder, reacting with extreme rage before dashing out of the room. Ben and Norris talk about guns and bombs, leading Veronica to track Ben, eventually seeing him buying fertilizer and taking out a rifle. Ben gets into the car and orders her to drive to the Camelot motel. There, Logan appears and beats him up before it is revealed that the [...] "suspect" [...] is actually an ATF agent. Ben says that he is investigating Norris, but needs her help: Norris has a crush on Veronica, and Ben asks her to get close to him. As she leaves the motel, Veronica and Logan kiss unexpectedly.|$|E

2500|$|Vaikundar died on 3 June 1851. According to Ayyavazhi followers, {{he is said}} to have {{attained}} Vaikundam. However, this date is disputed, as Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848. As he attained Vaikundam his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was later built. His devotees continued to visit this site [...] and performed the rituals as <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when Vaikundar was bodily present.

50|$|In baseball, batting is the act {{of facing}} the {{opposing}} pitcher and trying to produce offense for one's team. A batter or hitter is a person whose turn it is to face the pitcher. The three main goals of batters are to become a baserunner, drive runners home, or advance runners along the bases for others to drive home, but the techniques and strategies <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so vary. Hitting uses a motion that is virtually unique to baseball, one that is rarely used in other sports. Hitting is unique because unlike most sports movements in the vertical plane of movement hitting involves rotating in the horizontal plane.|$|R
