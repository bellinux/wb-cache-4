5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{on leaving}} the Army, Hutchison pitched into <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> as Conservative {{candidate}} in Glasgow Central. The previous election {{had seen a}} relatively narrow Conservative majority of 3,521, and was regarded as close {{enough to be a}} test of opinion among the Glasgow business community. Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill (who was somewhat late arriving) addressed a mass meeting at Blythswood Square in the division and received a warm reception from a large crowd. In the circumstances of the election (where the Conservatives lost 180 seats), Hutchison did well to win by 1,516 although the swing in Glasgow was much less than elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{continued}} his campaign against any further {{transfer of power}} to Indian natives. He continued to predict conflict in India and mass unemployment at home. His speeches often quoted nineteenth-century politicians and his own policy was to maintain the existing Raj. In pursuing this campaign Churchill cut himself off from the mainstream of Conservative politics as much as {{from the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> Younger Conservatives such as Duff Cooper, who later described Churchill's campaign as the most unfortunate event that occurred between the two wars, and Harold Macmillan saw Churchill as a reactionary, someone who was completely out of touch and at base, undemocratic - leaning towards the totalitarian regimes. Churchill's public comments often seemed that way.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 Lowe {{moved to}} London {{to read for}} the Bar, but his {{eyesight}} showed signs of serious weakness, and, acting on medical advice, sailed to Sydney in the colony of New South Wales, where he set {{to work in the}} law courts. On 7 November 1843 he was nominated by Sir George Gipps, the Governor of New South Wales, to a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council; owing to a difference with Gipps he resigned his seat on 9 September 1844, but was elected in April 1845 for Counties of St Vincent and Auckland. Lowe held that seat until 20 June 1848 and was elected for City of Sydney in July 1848, a seat he held until November 1849. Lowe soon made his mark in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> by his clever speeches, particularly on finance and education; and besides obtaining a large legal practice, he was involved with the founding {{and was one of the}} principal writers for the Atlas newspaper.|$|E

25|$|In January 1932, Rundstedt was {{appointed}} commander of Wehrkreis III, based in Berlin, and also given {{command of the}} 3rd Infantry Division. This brought him, at 57, into the highest ranks of the German Army, reflected in his promotion to Lieutenant General (Generalleutnant). It also inevitably brought him into close contact with <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world,</b> which was in a disturbed state due to the Great Depression and subsequent rise of Hitler's Nazi Party. The Defence Minister, General Kurt von Schleicher, was intriguing to bring the Nazis into the government, and the Chancellor, Franz von Papen, was planning to overthrow the Social Democrat government of Prussia, Germany's largest state. Despite his dislike of politics, Rundstedt could not remain uninvolved in these matters. In July 1932 Papen used his emergency powers to dismiss the Prussian Government. Martial law was briefly declared in Berlin and Rundstedt was made martial law plenipotentiary. He protested to Papen about this and martial law was lifted after a few days. In October Rundstedt was promoted to full General and given command of Gruppenkommando 1, covering the whole of eastern Germany.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Logan {{immediately}} identified her {{interests with}} those {{of her husband and}} in many ways she contributed to his many successes in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> She accompanied him on all his professional journeys, an undertaking in those days of wildernesses and no roads, often requiring great endurance and privation. A son, John Cunningham Logan, was born in 1856 but died the following year. Also in 1856, Mrs. Logan saw her husband elected a member of the Legislature, and in the Douglas and Lincoln Senatorial contest, he was elected as a Douglas Democrat to Congress. In all the political campaigns, the wife went with her husband, assisting in much of his Work of correspondence and copying, and frequently receiving his friends and conferring with them on the details of the campaign. When Mr. Logan came to Congress as a Representative, Mrs. Logan came with him. She remained with him in Washington until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he resigned his seat in Congress to return to Illinois to go into the service of his country.|$|E
25|$|An {{international}} {{court had}} long been proposed; Pierre Dubois suggested it in 1305 and Émeric Crucé in 1623. An idea of an international court of justice arose in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, where it was declared that arbitration between states was the easiest solution to disputes, providing a temporary panel of judges to arbitrate in such cases, the Permanent Court of Arbitration. At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, a draft convention for a permanent Court of Arbitral Justice was written although disputes and other pressing business at the Conference meant that such a body was never established, owing to difficulties agreeing on a procedure to select the judges. The outbreak of the First World War, and, in particular, its conclusion {{made it clear to}} many academics that some kind of world court was needed, and it was widely expected that one would be established. Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, created after the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the League to investigate setting up an international court. In June 1920, an Advisory Committee of jurists appointed by the League of Nations finally established a working guideline for the appointment of judges, and the Committee was then authorised to draft a constitution for a permanent court not of arbitration but of justice. The Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice was accepted in Geneva on December 13, 1920.|$|E

The article argues that <b>the</b> post-Westphalian <b>world</b> <b>political</b> system will witness the clashes between victory rules and participation rules and their eventual coexistence since {{the very nature of the}} victory rules hinders its institutionalization, consolidation and legitimation. The article suggests that the new system of state relations regardless of the name will be not less Westphalian than the preceding one thus new participation rules will have to be formulated and codified. </p...|$|R

500|$|As Jon Mee, {{a scholar}} of British radicalism, writes: [...] "Paine {{believed}} [...] [...] [...] a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution." [...] Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, [...] "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions." [...] It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's [...] "secular millennialism" [...] and it appears {{in all of his}} works—he ends the Rights of Man, for example, with the statement: [...] "From what we now see, nothing of reform in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which everything may be looked for." [...] Paine [...] "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," [...] emphasizing the possibilities of [...] "progress" [...] and [...] "human perfectibility" [...] that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.|$|E
500|$|George Martin says Verdi was [...] "the {{greatest}} artist" [...] of the Risorgimento. [...] "Throughout {{his work}} its values, its issues recur constantly, and he expressed them with great power". [...] Franco DellaPeruta {{agrees that the}} operas and the Risorgimento are linked, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links {{to the values of}} the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour, and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi's main works of 1842–49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including 'Nabucco' (1842), 'I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata' (1843), 'Ernani' (1844), 'Attila' (1846), 'Macbeth' (1847), and 'La Battaglia di Legnano' (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship by the absolutist regime in power. Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>world</b> of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861. Likewise, Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815, music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo claims that Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles.|$|E
