40|$|Treatment {{advocacy}} (TA) {{programs have}} been implemented by AIDS service organizations (ASOs) and primary care clinics across the USA to help engage clients with HIV into care and support their adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). TA aims to empower people with HIV through education and client-centered counseling regarding HIV, ART, and other health issues; advocate on behalf of patients with providers; and make referrals to healthcare services and clinical trials. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the impact TA has on clients' healthcare experiences. The present study's objectives included exploring how <b>TA</b> <b>services</b> help clients engage in HIV care, initiate ART, and adhere to HIV medications. We conducted 25 semi-structured qualitative open-ended interviews with clients living with HIV/AIDS recruited from AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA); four HIV medical providers; and two TA staff at APLA. Of the 25 clients interviewed, 92 % were male and 8 % were female. The average age was 43 years (SD= 9). About 60 % were African-American, 20 % were White, 12 % were other or multiracial, 4 % were Latino, and 4 % were Asian/Pacific Islander. Five interconnected themes consistently emerged across clients, TAs, and providers. TAs helped clients understand treatments and supported adherence within a holistic context. Further, TAs acted as a bridge to providers and helped clients build self-advocacy skills. Our data show that <b>TA</b> <b>services</b> go beyond traditional areas of education and treatment adherence. <b>TA</b> <b>services</b> within an ASO also provide a safe place to discuss initial HIV diagnoses and other health issues in a more comprehensive manner. <b>TA</b> <b>services</b> complemented medical and other social services by preparing clients with HIV to be better consumers of healthcare services. Future quantitative research examining the effectiveness of TA on improving clients' engagement in care and adherence is a critical next step.

40|$|Abstract — Trust {{authority}} (TA) {{services are}} both important infrastructure services for layered protocols requiring {{the availability of}} an identification and authentication mechanism such as access control mechanisms and confidentiality services, and can also be viewed as exemplars for the secure and efficient distribution of computations in general. While such general problems have been studied extensively, tactical MANET environments impose a number of requirements and constraints such as RF range and cost, battery limitations, and computational capabilities which call for more specific approaches. In this paper we report the analysis of algorithms for <b>TA</b> <b>service</b> distribution based on cluster head algorithms and improvements on the basic algorithms based on the specific requirements as identified {{in the course of}} simulations of tactical scenarios and realizing appreciable increases in efficiency over the general case in the process.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{presents the results of}} a research that examines technology appropriation (TA) awareness and identification in digital services start-up companies. Technology appropriation refers to the unexpected ways in which people adopt and adapt technology to make it serve their personal needs and motives. The research questions(Chapter 1) are: (1) How to identify TA within the development of digital services in the context of start-ups? (2) How aware are service providers of the phenomenon of TA? (3) What are the enablers for the appropriation of services by users? To address these questions, the thesis presents in chapter 2 a literature review that illustrates the context of the research, and explains its key concepts: digital services, user involvement in the development of digital services, technology appropriation, and levels of user engagement. Specific research methodological choices as well as specially designed research data collection and analysis tools are subsequently explained in chapter 3. An exploratory study is then introduced in chapter 4 to demonstrate how users can be involved in the development of digital services, evidencing the need for further research in TA. This initial work is concluded in chapter 5 by the introduction of a theoretical framework for TA (TF TA). Chapter 6 outlines the design and planning of the main study consisting of five case studies which provide empirical data for the core findings of this research. A first set of findings deriving from a comparison of TA examples found in the case studies based on the TA three levels proposed framework (TF TA) is presented in chapter 7. A second set of findings presented in chapter 8 helps to respond to the questions: (1) how aware are service providers of the phenomenon of TA, and (2) what are the enablers for the appropriation of services by users? These findings establish the level of TA awareness of each case study, outline the taxonomy of <b>TA</b> <b>service</b> types, and introduce emerging themes resulting from a thematic analysis, which also serves to propose enablers for TA within digital start-ups. Chapter 9 and 10 identifies and presents a third set of findings and contributions to knowledge. Main contributions are: a new tested and revised TA Level Framework created by examining the empirical findings against the TA Theoretical Framework (TA TF). And a new TA Identification Method within the development of digital services in the context of start-ups, underpinned by the tools previously developed in the research. Minor contributions explained in chapter 10 are: A taxonomy of TA services (pro-active / re-active / inactive), an account of the Key Aspects of TA Awareness, a Typology of TA Outcomes (Soft TA, Hard TA, and Hard & Soft), and a revised classification of TA Impact and TA levels. It also comprises an explanation of the relationship of TA Levels & TA Impact, a revised model of the user involvement approach, a new categorisation of TA User Actions (Expected/ Engage/ TA savvy), and an identification of TA Enablers (User Lead & Service Control). This research has found that the Key Aspects of TA Awareness are TA Concept, Systematic Programme of User Involvement, Mode of User Involvement, Identifying TA Actions, and the TA Enablers (User Lead & Service Control). The research has also found that the users actions and outcomes related to the adoption and adaption the technology, can be classified in High (when the users lead parts of the service), Medium (when the users customised and personalised the service) and Low levels (when the users used the service as intended, but give feedback to the service providers about its used). Additionally, this work has determined that the services and service providers TA Level Awareness is determined by how much they understand and know about TA. This awareness can be classified as proactive (when the service provider understands, identifies, and knowingly foster TA within the service), reactive (when the service provider understands TA in other services but cannot identify TA and reacts to users feedback and TA) and inactive (when the service provider does not recognised and cannot identify TA within the service). This investigation also has established that the aspects of the TA Level Framework can be integrated and employed as a method for TA identification within the services. This study has recognised that TA impact, the extent to which services are employed in the process of appropriation, can be classified as high, medium and low depending on how the service providers change and further develop their service because of their understanding and identification of TA. The enquiry also found that the level of TA impact is different from the TA Level, that the knowledge and awareness of TA impact are underpinned by the user actions and outcomes, as well as by their change and development. Another finding of this research is that the users TA outcomes (this is the tangible consequence of the user adoption and adaptation of technology) can be classified as Soft TA, Hard TA and Soft & Hard TA. Soft TA corresponds to the changes made by users related to the social practices evolution of the service, Hard TA refers to the changes made by the users in the API of the service. Soft & Hard TA relates to the combination of user changes in social aspects and the manipulation of the service s API. The study found that the service providers main approaches to user involvement are: listening to and collaborating, testing and experimenting and active observation. Last, this investigation determined that users actions concerning TA can be expected (users do nothing else other than the expected use of the service), engaged (where users are involved {{in the development of the}} service for personal motives) and TA savvy (where users are involved in in the development of the service for personal motives, but they have software and programming skills). The conclusions section summarises the research and explains its limitations. It also presents a personal reflection and indicates avenues for future research.

40|$|Therapeutic Abortion (TA) is the medically-necessary {{termination}} of pregnancy due to maternal or fetal health complications. As a “wicked problem”, TA involves multiple stakeholders with competing biomedical and political ideologies. This research paper synthesizes evidence-based biomedical and health policy literature relating to TA, thereby advancing {{the aims of}} reproductive justice by supporting women in making informed health decisions. Firstly, a biomedical literature investigation was conducted to identify international evidence-based abortion standards, according to pregnancy trimester. Secondly, a policy analysis utilizing the “ 3 -I” framework was conducted to determine the ideas, interests, and institutions involved in accessing safe and equitable TA in Canada. The biomedical literature investigation indicates the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is the “gold standard” for the medical {{termination of}} pregnancy in first trimester; dilation and evacuation is the preferred method for second trimester surgical abortion; and mifepristone followed by misoprostol can induce third trimester labour and delivery of a stillborn. Moreover, polarized discourses regarding fetal personhood (ideas), anti-abortion lobbying efforts (interests), and the policy legacy of Canadian federalism (institutions) negatively affect access to safe and equitable abortions in Canada, by deterring the use of evidence-based abortion guidelines. As {{a result of the}} political context surrounding TA in Canada, the availability of internationally recognized, evidence-based abortion practices does not guarantee safe and equitable TA access. Consequently, inter-sectoral collaboration between biomedical and health policy professionals is recommended in order to establish and implement broadly accessible <b>TA</b> <b>services</b> in Canada...|$|R

50|$|The Ta 152 {{score at}} the end of the war was likely seven {{victories}} and four losses in air combat, although a degree of uncertainty about those numbers exists.

The Ta 152 was delivered to JG 301 on 27 February 1945 and the first Ta 152 combat action against American bombers happened on 2 March 1945, so his victory against a B-17 on 20 February 1945 could not have been achieved flying that type of fighter. Alternatively, this results from an incorrect reading of published sources such as Lowe because JG 301 had the <b>Ta</b> 152 in <b>service</b> from late January 1945 and individual missions such as Keil's could well have been flown.

40|$|Under {{the wider}} policy {{framework}} as framed primarily (amongst other documents and acts) by the Every Child Matters agenda (DFES, 2004), the Removing Barriers to Achievement (2004) document, the Disability and Discrimination Act (DFES, 2005), Aiming High for disabled Children (2007) and the Lamb Enquiry (2009) {{that lead to}} further publications on parental confidence and involvement, the reasonable adjustments duty has become even more prominent for schools and settings in England. The reasonable adjustments duty has become statutory since 2007 and plethora of supportive material has been available to support settings on the implementation {{of what could be}} seen as a far more social orientated model of disability. This poster will communicate the findings of a qualitative, small-scale project under the umbrella of ICCIP (Institute for Child Centred Interprofessional Practice, Kingston University) that investigates those processes in action by exploring discourses and practices relating to ‘reasonable adjustments’ as used and understood by different stakeholders, front line workers (teachers, <b>TAs),</b> multi-agency <b>service</b> providers, school management teams, parents and the children themselves -for whom the adjustments have taken place. Shared values, beliefs and preparedness for inclusion verse exclusion will be explored through the above stakeholders’ voices. Method The study is in line with a qualitative interpretative research paradigm and aims a) to identify issues that will frame the research agenda, b) to explore in-depth the experiences of different stakeholders of reasonable adjustments in an inter-professional context, c) {{to gain a better understanding}} of the personal/social outcomes of these adjustments through the voice of the child. In the context of this project three primary school children from one-form entry inner-city primary school in London were selected. Each of the selected children has been part of the school’s inclusion register for an identified additional educational need or disability and their inclusion has required some kind of reasonable adjustment. One important aspect of the methodology of this project is the focus on service-user involvement and participation. Not only is one of the researchers also a service-user, but participants are invited to influence the direction of research in this and future projects, in line with the many advantages of this process outlined in the recent INVOLVE report (2009). Expected Outcomes The voices and experiences of stakeholders will inform a discussion about the need perhaps for a response along the lines of a ‘social pedagogy’ found in large parts of Western Europe and Scandinavia were education would be something much more than schools. It is based on a fundamentally holistic concept of children and adults in which the teachers concentrate on teaching but not in isolation (Whitney, 2007). Following this project, there is also scope for creating a network of stakeholders from different settings/boroughs on issues of inter-professional practice to promote positive and innovative examples of successful reasonable adjustments and their sustainability within a social model of disability. Possibilities for parent participation and possible parent forums will be explored, in line with recent government guidelines (Davies, 2010) ...|$|R
