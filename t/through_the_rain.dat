The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and okapi, which, {{in the case of the}} latter,zoo is famous for in both its breeding and research.

25|$|Steele was now desperately {{short of}} supplies, outnumbered and {{in danger of}} being {{surrounded}} at Camden. After his senior officers agreed with him that he had no other reasonable choice, Steele ordered a night withdrawal toward Little Rock on April 26 and the early morning of April 27, 1864. The Confederates did not detect Steele's movement until later in the day. Steele's forces used a pontoon bridge which they had carried on the campaign to cross the Ouachita River. Steele thus gained a head start on the Confederates who pursued the federal force as soon as they realized that Steele had withdrawn from Camden. First, the Confederates had to get across the swollen, and bridgeless, Ouachita River on the morning of April 28 by constructing a raft bridge. This delay allowed Steele to get a further head start, although rain soon slowed him down. The Confederates struggled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> as well, but they did not have as many wagons or as much equipment to slow down their pursuit.|$|E

500|$|Fantasia told Us Weekly {{that the}} lyrics revolve around [...] "how I don't let {{people talk about}} me {{like they used to}} [...] I control how I feel". She said the song deals with her {{attempted}} suicide and demanding relationships with her family, and how she wanted to bless people through her personal story and music. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the song's message: [...] "I wanted people to know that I've been <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> I 've been broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times people would say, 'That's it for her,' but that didn't happen." [...] Christian Todays Czarina Ong referred to [...] "I Made It" [...] as Fantasia's [...] "victory song" [...] and [...] "her song of success". According to Rito P.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.3 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He thought that the finale did not resolve every plot line {{by the end of}} the episode. However, he did not blame the writers, because they were not planning for the episode to be a series finale. He enjoyed the final scene between Logan, Veronica, and Piz because of the variety of different ways in which it could be interpreted. While he expressed some frustration over Keith's criminal charges and the ambiguity regarding the outcome of the sheriff's election, he opined that one could still take away important messages from the show because of Keith's actions in the episode. The reviewer also lauded the final scene, writing that [...] "the melancholy feeling of the final scene – with Veronica walking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> having cast a vote for her dad that is probably meaningless – felt right for the series".|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E
