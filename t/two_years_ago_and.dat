He has been trying to get a {{foothold}} in pictures for eight years but received no encouragement although he tried every angle known to town—extra work, bit parts, stock contracts, dramatic schools, assault of the casting offices.

500|$|In 1965, Clancy {{switched}} to end {{and became the}} first Michigan Wolverine with 50receptions in a season, and set Michigan single-season records with 52receptions and 762yards. [...] In his first game at the end position, Clancy made what was described as [...] "a circus catch" [...] in the endzone on a pass from quarterback Dick Vidmer. [...] Clancy set the Big Ten receiving record in against Wisconsin, catching a 52-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Wally Gabler on Michigan's first offensive play. [...] At the time, the Associated Press reported: [...] "What makes Clancy's record so much more impressive {{is the fact that he}} came to Michigan as a quarterback, {{switched to}} halfback and won a spot there <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> then turned to end this season. [...] And with Michigan's reputation for always having talented ends—Benny Oosterbaan, Lowell Perry, Ron Kramer and John Henderson among them—Clancy's feat takes on even more brilliance." [...] At the end of the season, Clancy's teammates chose him as captain for the 1966 season. [...] He was also named a second-team All-Big Ten player by the United Press International (UPI).|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, perhaps, is all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet. Michigan's Charlie Fonville, the athlete with the bad back, was the world's best shot putter <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> still holds the official mark of [...]" [...] Though Fonville won the 1950 Drake relays, his winning throw of [...] was described as [...] "comparatively puny" [...] compared to the [...] throws of Jim Fuchs that year. In 1952, Michigan track coach (and future athletic director) Don Canham dedicated his book Field Techniques Illustrated to Fonville as follows: [...] "Dedicated to Charlie Fonville a world record holder who accepted disappointment as graciously as he did fame and success." ...|$|E
