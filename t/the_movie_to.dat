5|$|Skywalker Sound {{supplied}} the development team with sound directly from The Phantom Menace {{for use in}} Battle for Naboo. Because its music is fully interactive and in real-time, the game required new material to be composed and pieces from <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> be rewritten. Factor 5 again used its own sound drivers called MusyX to handle the game's sound, as it did with Rogue Squadron (then called MOsys FX Surround). The game includes voice work from voice actors Jeff Coopwood, Roger L. Jackson, Doug Boyd and Terence McGovern.|$|E

5|$|The Romanian premiere {{took place}} on June 4, 2006 at the Transylvania International Film Festival, in Cluj-Napoca. In Bucharest, a first display of the movie was {{organized}} on September 8, 2006, in a square established for this purpose on Calea Rahovei Street. The public, {{as well as the}} critics from the country, received the movie very well, but the difficulty caused by the movie's unusual duration only allowed for <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> be on display on a few other occasions. The same problem was encountered when the movie was sent to film festivals outside Romania, being either rejected due to the impossibly of being included in any of the standard categories or included as a short fiction (for example, at Brooklyn).|$|E

25|$|Twentieth Century Fox {{changed the}} title from The Man on the Ledge to Fourteen Hours {{at the request}} of Warde's mother, so the picture would not be as closely {{identified}} with her son. Studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck considered changing the setting of <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> another city for the same reason. But it was ultimately filmed in New York.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of the film is}} accompanied by incidental music. For this material, the original score was composed by Arthur Honegger in 1927 in France. A separate score was written by Werner Heymann in Germany, also in 1927. In pace with Brownlow's efforts to restore <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> something close to its 1927 incarnation, two scores were prepared in 1979–1980; one by Carl Davis in the UK and one by Carmine Coppola in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} at 2007's Screamfest Horror Film Festival, where it impressed {{an assistant at}} the Creative Artists Agency, Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> as {{many people in the}} industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by Miramax Films Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the Sundance Film Festival, but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed DreamWorks executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally Steven Spielberg, who cut a deal with Blum and Peli.|$|E

25|$|Paramount {{production}} chief Robert Evans, who {{had given}} Puzo an advance to write The Godfather so that Paramount would own the movie rights, hired Coppola after many major directors had turned the movie down because he wanted an Italian-American director who could provide the movie with cultural authenticity. Coppola also came cheap. Evans was conscious {{of the fact that}} Paramount's last Mafia movie, The Brotherhood (1968) had been a box office bomb, and he believed it was partly {{due to the fact that}} the director, Martin Ritt, and the star, Kirk Douglas, were Jews and the film lacked an authentic Italian flavor. The studio originally intended <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> be a low-budget production set in contemporary times without any major actors, but the phenomenal success of the novel gave Evans the clout to turn The Godfather into a prestige picture.|$|E
25|$|Impressed with McG's music videos, Drew Barrymore {{approached}} him about directing a Charlie's Angels film. He accepted, {{wanting to take}} on bigger projects, and pitched <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> the studio executives, who were initially reluctant but later approved the project after much persistence. The film, {{for which he was}} paid $350,000, was released in 2000 and went on to gross over $250 million worldwide with mixed critical reception from critics and fans alike. However, he won the Hollywood Breakthrough Award at the 6th Annual Hollywood Film Festival held in 2002. Proving himself to be quite bankable, Sony paid him $2.5 million to helm Dreadnought for Red Wagon Entertainment, a military action-drama following the captain of a small ship as he attempts to save the survivors of a shot-down commercial airliner and evade the captain of the Dreadnought, a technologically advanced and heavily armed ship, that tries to cover up the incident. He was also set to develop a sequel to Charlie's Angels and present his film producing debut with Airshow, the latter of which has yet to be made.|$|E
25|$|Director Robert Zemeckis drew {{inspiration}} for the visual effects of Beowulf from experience with The Polar Express, which used motion capture technology to create three-dimensional images of characters. Appointing Jerome Chen, whom Zemeckis worked with on The Polar Express, the two decided to chart realism as their foremost goal. Over 450 graphic designers were chosen for the project, the largest team ever assembled for an Imageworks-produced movie as of 2007. Designers at Imageworks generated new animation tools for facial, body, and cloth design especially for the movie, and elements of keyframe animation were incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> capture the facial expressions of the actors and actresses. The mead hall battle scene {{near the beginning of}} the film, among others, required numerous props that served as additional markers; these markers allowed for a more accurate manifestation of a battlefield setting as the battle progressed. However, the data being collected by the markers slowed down the studios' computer equipment, and five months were spent developing a new save/load system that would increase the efficiency of the studios' resources. To aid in the process of rendering the massive quantities of information, the development team used cached data. In the cases that using cached data was not possible, the scenes were rendered using foreground occlusion, which involves the blurring of different overlays of a single scene in an attempt to generate a single scene film.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} co-produced by Daniels's company, Lee Daniels Entertainment, and the Sarah Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness-owned Smokewood Entertainment Group. The two {{production}} companies had previously collaborated with Daniels on Tennessee (2008). Precious had, in total, thirteen producers: Daniels, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Heller, Tyler Perry, Lisa Cortes, Gary Magness, Valerie Hoffman, Asger Hussain, Mark G. Mathis, Andrew Sforzini, Bergen Swason, Simone Sheffield and Sarah Siegel-Magness. Initially, Daniels {{did not expect}} <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> generate much buzz, expecting <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> go straight to video, stating [...] "That it {{made it to the}} big screen says there was an angel looking after me." [...] Principal photography (filming) for the film took place on location in various parts of New York City. Despite the dark subject matter, Sidibe has stated that the mood on the set was lighthearted, that [...] "Every day was a party" [...] and that the cast would frequently sing and tell jokes to [...] "lighten the atmosphere." [...] The production budget was $10million.|$|E

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> feel timeless and for <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements.

500|$|Hughes {{intended}} <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> be {{more focused}} on the characters rather than the plot. [...] "I know how the movie begins, I know how it ends", said Hughes.

Therefore, I make them as full and real as I can. This time around, I {{wanted to create a}} character who could handle everyone and everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Fighting Tommy Riley {{received}} generally positive reviews, with Eddie Jones frequently {{singled out}} for his performance. Variety gave the film an overall favorable review, citing Jones in particular for [...] "personally push <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> a higher emotional plane." [...] Davis and Tayler are also praised, the former for [...] "grow into [...] role" [...] and the latter for her [...] "pro job at playing counterpoint" [...] to Jones.
