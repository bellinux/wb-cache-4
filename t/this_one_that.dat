Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
25|$|By {{its nature}} Vulgar Latin varied greatly by region and by time period. A few major {{divisions}} can be seen, however. Vulgar Latin dialects began to significantly diverge from Classical Latin during the 3rd century during the classical {{period of the}} Roman Empire. Nevertheless up to the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the most widely spoken dialects were still similar to and mostly mutually intelligible with Classical Latin. With {{the collapse of the}} Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Gothic and Frankish rulers of western Europe created a substantially different Germanic-influenced language, a language that was substantially different from Classical Latin; indeed it is <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is most often known as Proto-Romance. Similarly in the Eastern Roman Empire as Latin faded as the court language, the Vulgar Latin spoken there became heavily influenced by Greek and Slavic and also became radically different from Classical Latin and from the proto-Romance of Western Europe.|$|E

500|$|Wolf 359 {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of [...] motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>that</b> are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.|$|E
500|$|PETA made further remarks criticizing Discovery Channel's {{decision}} {{to go on with}} the special despite its earlier objections, arguing that [...] "study after study has shown that entertainment features such as <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> show humans interfering with and handling wild animals are detrimental to species conservation. Rosolie knows this. Discovery knows this. Yet they chose to contrive and air this shameful stunt for ratings anyway." [...] In a statement following the broadcast, Discovery Channel re-affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority, and that he [...] "created this challenge to get maximum attention {{for one of the most}} beautiful and threatened parts of the world, the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife. He went to great lengths to send this message and it was his absolute intention to be eaten alive." ...|$|E

I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{far north}} as Fairbanks, Alaska, a {{reviewer}} wrote that, if the film had been shown {{to the people of}} Europe before the war started {{there would have been no}} war:"'Civilization' is worth $1.50 today, tomorrow, or at any time.

After seeing 'Civilization' one can truthfully say that had Henry Ford produced a film like <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Ince directed, and sent it broadcast throughout the civilized world as an argument against war, he would have accomplished more for universal peace than did his famous 'peace expedition.' He would have reached the great mass of people who have but a faint recollection of the horrors of war, and would have showed them the pain and the suffering and the sorrow that war brings with it. Had such a picture as 'Civilization' been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Five {{years after}} the Munich study was published, Jim T. Enright, a {{professor}} of physiology who emphasised correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study's results are merely consistent with statistical fluctuations and not significant. He believed the experiments provided [...] "the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim", stating that the data analysis was [...] "special, unconventional and customized". Replacing it with [...] "more ordinary analyses", {{he noted that the}} best dowser was on average [...] out of [...] closer to a mid-line guess, an advantage of 0.04%, and that the five other [...] "good" [...] dowsers were on average farther than a mid-line guess. Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; if they only afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method. He further pointed out that the six [...] "good" [...] dowsers did not perform any better than chance in separate tests. Another study published in Pathophysiology hypothesized that such experiments as <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> were carried out in the 20th century could have been interfered with by man-made radio frequency radiation, as test subjects' bodies absorbed the radio waves and unconscious hand movement reactions took place following the standing waves or intensity variations.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hunter" [...] {{garnered}} acclaim {{from music}} critics, who complimented its elaborate production, its haunting melody and cryptic lyrics. Marvin Lin from Tiny Mix Tapes called it [...] "painfully beautiful". Jack Dickey of Deadspin considered [...] "Hunter" [...] {{one of the}} only two songs in the album where [...] "the instruments win out" [...] and wrote it [...] "is like Peter and the Wolf if, instead of a merciful hunter, Artemis were chasing the wolf." [...] In a review for the single release, Keir Langley of AllMusic praised the rhythm and intensity of the track as a showcase of her collaboration with Mark Bell. The Wires Louise Gray thought it was an [...] "extraordinary, mesmeric song." [...] Evelyn McDonnell wrote [...] "I myself had used the prevalent critical category for Björk uncategorizable amalgalm of styles: 'quirky.' There was nothing quirky about 'Hunter.'" [...] She also praised the song's originality and appeal to various types of listeners. Phil Freeman included [...] "Hunter" [...] in his list of songs which [...] "say something important about the state of music since 1979—how venerable forms have changed;" [...] inspired by Greil Marcus' attempt to define rock and roll in Stranded (1978). He wrote [...] "her voice is protean and capable of astonishingly raw, forceful outbursts, but it's when she holds it in, on tracks like <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>that</b> her real power emerges." [...] Authors Shirley R. Steinberg and Donaldo Pereira Macedo identified elements of Donna Haraway's A Cyborg Manifesto in [...] "Hunter". They state that, by assuming the position of authority in relation to the masculine other, Björk challenges the traditional notions of femininity; and that by [...] " [...] to be the hunter," [...] she [...] "disrupts the nature/culture binary of which Haraway speaks." ...|$|E
