5|$|Lamason's {{leadership}} {{boosted the}} airmen's spirits {{and gave them}} hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing. One of the first assignments Lamason gave was <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp. During their incarceration, Lamason insisted the airmen march, parade and act as a military unit.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig Borga {{dominated}} {{the majority of}} a squash match against Marty Jannetty. He attacked Jannetty immediately {{with a series of}} punches and knees. Jannetty managed a couple of brief comebacks but was unable <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> serious offense. Borga used his strength to control the match and won the match by submission with a backbreaker.|$|E

5|$|With the {{internal}} weaknesses of fusionism now exposed, the Colorados moved to oust its supporters from the government. Their leader, Brigadier General Venancio Flores, a caudillo {{and an early}} proponent of fusionism, found himself without sufficient military resources <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> sustained revolt and resorted to asking for intervention by Argentina.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> combined offensive {{between the}} Franks and Mongols were too little and too late. In May 1291, {{the city of}} Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly {{needed time to}} regroup and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E

5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{pay-per-view}} began, Shane Douglas defeated Buddy Rose {{in a dark}} match. Hercules attacked Shawn Michaels {{prior to}} the first televised bout, hitting him in the knee with a chain. Although his partner was unable to compete, Jannetty controlled {{the beginning of the}} match, using hip tosses to throw Roma and Hercules. Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down and got the victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by a diving splash from Roma.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{came into}} this game after losses the {{previous}} week. Iowa State dropped to 3–3 (0–2 Big12) with a 28–14 loss to Nebraska in Ames. There were three Cyclone touchdowns negated by the officials in that game (one called caught out of bounds, two on offensive penalties). Oklahoma lost to Texas {{for the second straight}} year in the Red River Rivalry in Dallas and was unable <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> successful offensive drive for the entire second half. The Sooners also committed 11penalties (a full third of their season total at the time) and five turnovers in that game. After equally disappointing weeks, both teams were looking to rebound.|$|E

5|$|Brown put {{the odds}} for the {{existence}} of Planet Nine at about 90%. Greg Laughlin, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this paper, gives an estimate of 68.3%.

Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> search for a new planet.|$|E
5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> counter-offensive. He left Constantinople {{the day after}} celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. His young son, Heraclius Constantine, was left behind as regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks {{along the}} Italian coast {{prompted}} Dubourdieu <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> second invasion of Lissa. Taking {{advantage of the}} temporary absence of Montagu, Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga. The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot. Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based aircraft carriers, and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti-aircraft guns to protect themselves and other ships (principally the US aircraft carriers) from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|He was {{expected}} by some <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, {{which was the}} club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, {{elements}} of XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Drava at Gyékényes and attacked towards Koprivnica. Available {{troops of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska took up defensive positions to stop this German penetration and Petrović ordered Nedeljković <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> counter-attack against the bridgehead. By nightfall the counter-attack had not materialised, the defenders had withdrawn to Koprivnica, and Petrović had ordered Nedeljković to counter-attack on the following morning. Also on 7 April, the few remaining reconnaissance aircraft of the 4th Army mounted attacks on a bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. On 8 April, the XLVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand its bridgehead at Gyékényes.|$|E
