500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it really is/ I can only <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before rehearsals {{began in}} January 1951, Rodgers {{had the first}} Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, {{including}} Lawrence's own songs. [...] Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} scheduled to feature Dan Nelson on vocals. However, following the events later that year, {{he was no}} longer a member of the band. When asked {{what would happen to the}} completed studio album featuring Nelson's vocals, Ian said: [...] "Until we have a new singer, I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> will happen to the record. We'll probably change a few things on it, including the vocals." [...] Ian also indicated that the album's release could be delayed until 2010. It was assumed that John Bush was going to record new vocals for the album after his reunion with the band. However, this did not happen. In an interview at the time, Bush said he was trying to re-record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> we ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E
500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be [...] "scary" [...] and that [...] "children [...] want to see that." [...] Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: [...] "We mention that she exists but we don't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> happened to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed {{to go into the}} subject." [...] Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word [...] "dead" [...] was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes [...] "Real or Robots?" [...] (1991), [...] "Chuckie vs. the Potty" [...] (1992), and [...] "My Friend Barney" [...] (1993).|$|E

And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...
