25|$|Herbivores such as {{cows and}} sheep consume <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> matter (grass) which {{contains}} β-sitosterol {{as the principal}} sterol. β-sitosterol is the 24-ethyl derivative of cholesterol {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> matter (see section). In the gut of these animals, bacteria biohydrogenate the double bond in the 5 position to create 24-ethyl coprostanol and so this compound {{can be used as a}} biomarker for faecal matter from herbivores. Typical values in different source materials can be seen in the table after Gilpin.|$|E

25|$|As a {{postdoctoral}} researcher at Florida State University, US (1971–1973), Truswell {{participated in the}} first Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) voyages to Antarctica, which still holds {{the record for the}} furthest south of such drilling. This voyage contributed to a new understanding of the age of the Antarctic ice sheet and the development of an early version of the Antarctic Convergence. Subsequent work on Ocean Drilling Program material led her, along with M.K. Macphail, to decipher an unparalleled pollen record from Prydz Bay, revealing the composition of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> communities during the earliest stages of ice-cap formation during the Late Eocene preglacial-glacial transition.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometric}} series rank-abundance diagram is linear with a slope of –k, and reflects a rapid decrease in species abundances by rank (Figure 4). The {{geometric series}} does not explicitly assume that species colonize an area sequentially, however, the model fits {{the concept of}} niche preemption, where species sequentially colonize a region and the first species to arrive receives the majority of resources. The geometric series model fits observed species abundances in highly uneven communities with low diversity. This is expected to occur in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> communities (as these assemblages often show strong dominance) as well as communities at early successional stages and those in harsh or isolated environments (Figure 5).|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} {{are subject to}} similarly adverse impacts from eutrophication. Increased nitrates in soil are frequently undesirable for plants. Many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> species are endangered {{as a result of}} soil eutrophication, such as the majority of orchid species in Europe. Meadows, forests, and bogs are characterized by low nutrient content and slowly growing species adapted to those levels, so they can be overgrown by faster growing and more competitive species. In meadows, tall grasses that can take advantage of higher nitrogen levels may change the area so that natural species may be lost. Species-rich fens can be overtaken by reed or reedgrass species. Forest undergrowth affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a nettle and bramble thicket.|$|E

500|$|Two [...] thick tephra {{deposits}} {{are situated}} between sand, silt, mud and gravel in the Dease Lake and Finlay River areas. They both range in composition from phonolitic to trachytic and {{are high in}} iron(II) oxide, indicating that the tephras were likely extruded from a single volcano. Radiocarbon dating of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> macrofossils directly overlying the youngest tephra deposit suggests an early Holocene age for this volcanic material. Because Level Mountain has received little scientific study and it is debated {{on whether or not}} Holocene volcanic rocks are present, the volcano is a possible source for these tephra deposits along with Hoodoo Mountain, Heart Peaks and the Mount Edziza complex.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Water {{relation}} {{properties of}} two ecological forms of Alisma plantago-aquatica L. grown along river beds with partial submergence {{and on the}} riverside were examined to determine the possible mechanisms involved in plant response to moderate water deficit. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> in comparison with aerial-aquatic ones are considerably smaller and lower in the entire biomass becoming dwarfs and reaching about 0. 5 - 0. 7 m above river. Plant water relations were evaluated by measuring absolute and relative water content, water and osmotic potentials, {{and the state of}} water in leaves. The lower water content in the riverside soil led to a higher water deficit and reduction of the absolute and relative water content in the leaves of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> in comparison with aerial-aquatic ones. The absolute and relative water content correlated positively with leaf water potentials. It was revealed that osmotic regulation of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> was realized to a greater degree by the mineral constituent. The adaptive mechanism of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> was also accompanied with redistribution of water fractional composition, reducing the free and increasing the bound water quantity. The responses of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> are discussed in terms of the adaptive mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the water balance under water-stress conditions...|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, the United States Navy {{contracted}} a vegetation {{survey that}} identified about 280 species of terrestrial vascular plants on Diego Garcia. None {{of these was}} endemic, and another survey in 2005 identified just 36 species as [...] "native", meaning arriving without the assistance of humans, and found elsewhere in the world. No <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> species are of any conservation-related concern at present.|$|E
2500|$|Fourteen {{distinct}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> communities {{occur on}} the island, which is mostly clothed in various forms of eucalypt forest. [...] Natural and historical clearings provide grazing for many animals, such as bare-nosed wombats and Tasmanian pademelons. [...] Nearly all the island's animals are native to Tasmania although some, including eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies and Cape Barren geese, were introduced during the late 1960s and early 1970s. [...] Feral cats are descendants of domestic pets brought to the island since the 19th century. Fallow deer were also introduced to the island and were present primarily in the French's Farm area, but sometimes wandered {{as far north as}} the small marsh behind Hopground Beach. [...] Sheep were present until around 1981, escapes from prior sheep farming operations. [...] Other animals include common brushtail and ringtail possums, short-beaked echidnas and three species of snake.|$|E
2500|$|A very {{troublesome}} {{marine species}} in southern Europe is the seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia. Caulerpa was first {{observed in the}} Mediterranean Sea in 1984, {{off the coast of}} Monaco. By 1997, it had covered some 50km². It has a strong potential to overgrow natural biotopes, and represents a major risk for sublittoral ecosystems. The origin of the alga in the Mediterranean was thought to be either as a migration through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea, or as an accidental introduction from an aquarium. [...] Another troublesome plant species is the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> Phyla canescens, which was intentionally introduced into many countries in North America, Europe, and Africa as an ornamental plant. [...] This species has become invasive in Australia, where it threatens native rare plants and causes erosion and soil slumping around river banks. It has also become invasive in France where it has been listed as an invasive plant species of concern in the Mediterranean region, where it can form monocultures that threaten critical conservation habitats.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a single {{publication}} stating that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> emit methane has sparked a discussion in several scientific journals, but an independent test {{has not yet been}} performed. Here it is shown, {{with the use of the}} stable isotope C- 13 and a laser-based measuring technique, that there is no evidence for substantial aerobic methane emission by <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants,</b> maximally 0. 3 % (0. 4 ng g(- 1) h(- 1)) of the previously published values. Data presented here indicate that the contribution of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> to global methane emission is very small at best. Therefore, a revision of carbon sequestration accounting practices based on the earlier reported contribution of methane from terrestrial vegetation is redundant...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{publication}} of Keppler et al.’s (2006) findings, there was a substantial response from the scientific community. Many questioned the findings, pointing to flaws in Keppler et al.’s methodology. In particular, their up-scaling method for calculating global estimates for methane emissions by <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> was criticized. A number of follow-up publications presented conflicting data, generating significant uncertainty {{in the role of}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plants</b> to the global methane budget.|$|R

2500|$|Studies have {{determined}} that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, have the capability of reducing [...] emissions by up to 80%. [...] An algae-based system could capture approximately 80% of the [...] emitted from a power plant when sunlight is available. [...] Although this [...] will later be released into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned, this [...] would have entered the atmosphere regardless. [...] The possibility of reducing total [...] emissions therefore lies {{in the prevention of}} the release of [...] from fossil fuels. [...] Furthermore, compared to fuels like diesel and petroleum, and even compared to other sources of biofuels, the production and combustion of algal biofuel does not produce any sulfur oxides or nitrous oxides, and produces a reduced amount of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and reduced emission of other harmful pollutants. Since <b>terrestrial</b> <b>plant</b> sources of biofuel production simply do not have the production capacity to meet current energy requirements, microalgae {{may be one of the}} only options to approach complete replacement of fossil fuels.|$|E
