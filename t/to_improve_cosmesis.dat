40|$|AbstractPurposeIn thyroid surgery, {{minimally}} invasive procedures are thought <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>cosmesis</b> and patient's satisfaction. However, studies using standardized tools are scarce, and results are controversial. Moreover, {{minimally invasive}} techniques {{raise the question}} of material costs in a context of health spending cuts. The aim of the present study is to test a cost-effective surgical workflow <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>cosmesis</b> in conventional open thyroid surgery. MethodsOur study ran between January 2009 and November 2010, and was based on a prospectively maintained thyroid surgery register. Patients operated for benign thyroid diseases were included. Since January 2010, a standardized surgical workflow was used in addition to the reference open procedure to improve the outcome. Two groups were created: (1) G 1 group (patients operated with the reference technique), (2) G 2 group (patients operated with our workflow in addition to reference technique). Patients were investigated for postoperative outcomes, self-evaluated body image, cosmetic and self-confidence scores. Results 820 patients were included in the present study. The overall body image and cosmetic scores were significantly better in the G 2 group (P <  0. 05). No significant difference was noted in terms of surgical outcomes, scar length, and self-confidence. ConclusionsOur surgical workflow in conjunction with the reference technique is safe and shows significant better results in terms of body image and cosmesis than do the reference technique alone. Thus, we recommend its implementation in order to improve outcomes in a cost-effective way. The limitations of the present study should be kept in mind in the elaboration of future studies...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of natural {{orifices}} translumena endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port/single-incision laparoscopy (SPL/SLS), minimally invasive surgery recently underwent to an impressive evolution, mainly <b>improving</b> the <b>cosmesis</b> and reducing the abdominal wall trauma. A new concept to be less invasive in minimally invasive surgery started to be popular and named reduced port laparoscopic surgery (RPLS). A reduced number of trocars associated to a reduced size of each trocar and instrument chracterizes this new technique. During conventional multiport laparoscopic colorectal surgery, the specimen has to be retrieved, hence an enlargement of the trocar or a new opening of the abdominal wall is necessary. With NOTES, surgeons started to consider the natural orifices to remove the specimen from the abdomen (vagina/rectum), and with SPL/SLS to minimize the abdominal trauma and <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the <b>cosmesis.</b> In this chapter a right colectomy is described using the suprapubic scar as the main access to perform RPLS and also to remove the specimen from the abdomen at the end. This access remains under the bikini line, hence cosmetically acceptable. The procedure is performed using three reusable trocars inserted close each others in the same suprapubic incision, and curved reusable instruments. Each step is represented by specific drawings showing the internal triangulation, which characterizes the conventional multiport laparoscopy, and the external surgeon's ergonomy.

40|$|Background: The latest attempt <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the <b>cosmesis</b> of {{laparoscopic surgery}} is laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). We present our initial {{experience}} {{with an alternative}} procedure with similar cosmetic benefit but without technical limitations. Methods: Small strategic laparoscopic incision placement (SLIP) nephrectomy is performed transperitoneally, generally using three 5 -mm ports (one in the umbilicus) and one 12 -mm port placed below the pubic hairline, such that only two 5 -mm scars are visible without close inspection. We assessed our first 21 procedures, which included all but five of the standard transperitoneal nephrectomies by a single surgeon from June 2008 through July 2009. These were matched 1 : 2 (exactly by gender and American Society of Anesthesiology score, and then closest in age and body mass index) from 96 patients undergoing similar standard transperitoneal laparoscopic procedures from 2005 through 2008. Results: The SLIP and control groups were well matched, with mean age and body mass index differing by only 3. 6 years and 1. 1, respectively. Of the SLIP patients, 34 % were obese or morbidly obese, and a trainee was the primary surgeon in 81 % of cases. Mean operative time was 23 minutes longer in the SLIP cases. There {{was no difference between}} groups in estimated blood loss, complication rate, or convalescence. Conclusions: Like LESS, SLIP nephrectomy provides <b>improved</b> <b>cosmesis.</b> Unlike LESS, it is only slightly more difficult to perform than standard laparoscopic nephrectomy and can be performed in technically challenging cases (obesity, large specimen, etc).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Minimally {{invasive}} thyroidectomy (MIT) {{has gained}} {{popularity in the}} surgical management of benign and malignant pathology of the thyroid. One of the main benefits of utilizing this technique {{is the use of}} smaller incisions resulting in increased cosmetic satisfaction. Unfortunately, the retraction required for adequate exposure during MIT may lead to skin damage, impaired wound healing and poor cosmetic outcomes. Some have proposed that excising incision edges prior <b>to</b> closure may <b>improve</b> <b>cosmesis.</b> A review of the literature does not reveal any histologic evidence to support this technique. MATERIAL/METHODS: In this prospective observational study, nine subjects undergoing MIT were identified. Both the superior and inferior skin edges were excised and labeled for orientation. Specimens were sent for hematoxylin and eosin staining and histologic analysis by a staff pathologist. RESULTS: All specimens showed no significant findings such as damage to the architecture of the dermis, acute inflammation, edema or evidence of hemorrhage. Focal blood vessel ectasia within the dermis was identified in three of nine subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not yield a histological basis supporting the routine trimming of incisions during MIT. Although no significant findings were noted histologically, further studies are warranted to investigate the long-term cosmetic outcome of MIT incisions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Single-access {{laparoscopy}} has garnered {{growing interest}} {{in recent years in}} an attempt <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>cosmesis,</b> reduce postoperative pain, and minimize abdominal wall trauma. Case Description: A female patient suffering from a symptomatic giant biliary cyst of the liver segments 4 - 7 - 8 was admitted for transumbilical single-access laparoscopic cyst unroofing. The procedure was performed using a standard 11 -mm reusable trocar for a 10 -mm, 30 °- angled, rigid scope and curved reusable instruments inserted transumbilically without trocars. Operative time was 90 minutes, and the final incision length was 14 mm. The use of minimal pain medication permitted discharge on the third postoperative day, and after 25 months, the patient remains asymptomatic with a no visible umbilical scar. Conclusions: Giant biliary cysts can be removed by single-access laparoscopy. Because of this technique, surgeons work in ergonomic positions, and the cost of the procedure remains {{similar to that of the}} multitrocar technique. The incision length and the use of pain medication are kept minimal as well. © 2012 by JSLS. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background:. We {{report a}} {{technique}} of immediate nipple-areolar complex (NAC) reconstruction for patients undergoing skin-sparing mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstruction or therapeutic mammoplasty with central excision. Methods:. Immediate nipple reconstruction {{is performed using}} a modified C-V flap planned {{along the edge of}} the incision. The areola is reconstructed using a full-thickness skin graft taken from skin usually discarded during the procedure. Immediate NAC reconstruction using this technique was performed on 32 breasts in 21 patients. This included 19 risk-reducing mastectomies, 9 therapeutic mastectomies, and 2 major revisions to existing implant reconstruction. Reconstruction was direct to implant in 29 breasts and by expander in 1 breast. The device was placed in a pre- or post-pectoral plane utilizing dermal sling and/or acellular dermal matrix as determined on a case-by-case basis. Immediate NAC reconstruction was also performed on 2 patients undergoing therapeutic mammoplasty with central excision. Results:. Mean follow-up is 12 months (5 – 27 months), and cosmetic results have been good. There have been no significant complications, and no revisional surgery has been required. Conclusion:. The application of simple techniques for NAC reconstruction in the primary procedure allows reconstruction of the whole breast in a single stage.

40|$|Introduction: Surgery for bladder exstrophy {{has been}} {{evolving}} {{over the last}} four to five decades. Because survival has become almost universal, the focus has changed in the exstrophy-epispadias complex to improving quality of life. The most prevalent problem in the long-term function of exstrophy patients is the sexual activity of the adolescent and adult males. The penis in exstrophy patients appears short because of marked congenital deficiency of anterior corporal tissue. Many patients approach for genital reconstruction <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>cosmesis</b> as well as to correct chordee. We report our series of male patients seeking genital reconstruction following exstrophy repair in the past. Materials and Methods: Fourteen adolescent/adult male patients attended urology services during the period January 2000 -December 2009 seeking genital reconstruction following exstrophy repair in the past. Results: Three patients underwent epispadias repair, four patients had chordee correction with cosmetic excision of skin tags and seven patients underwent chordee correction with penile lengthening. All patients reported satisfaction in the answered questionnaire. Patients undergoing penile lengthening by partial corporal dissection achieved a mean increase in length of 1. 614 ± 0. 279 cm dorsally and 1. 543 ± 0. 230 cm ventrally. The satisfactory rate assessed by the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) showed that irrespective of the different genital reconstructive procedures done, the patients were satisfied with cosmetic and functional outcome. Conclusions: Surgical procedures have transformed the management in these patients with bladder exstrophy. Bladders can be safely placed within the pelvis, with most patients achieving urinary continence and cosmetically acceptable external genitalia. Genital reconstruction in the form of correction of chordee, excision of ugly skin tags and lengthening of penis can be performed to give the patients a satisfactory cosmetic and functional system...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{appendicectomy}} though widely practiced has not gained universal approval. Laparoscopic appendicectomy in India {{is relatively}} new and the literature is scant. This study was aimed to compare laparoscopic with open appendicectomy and ascertain the therapeutic benefit, if any, in the overall management of acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of two hundred and seventy nine patients suffering from acute appendicitis. One hundred patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) and one hundred seventy nine patients underwent open appendecectomy (OA). Comparison was based on length of hospital stay, operating time, postoperative morbidity, duration of convalescence and operative cost {{in terms of their}} medians. The Mann-Whitney statistics (T) were calculated and because of large samples, the normal deviate test (Z) was used. RESULTS: Of the hundred patients, six patients (6 &#x 0025;) had the procedure converted to open surgery. The rate of infections and overall complications (LA: 15 &#x 0025;, OA: 31. 8 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 001) were significantly lower in patients undergoing LA. The median length of stay was significantly shorter after LA (3 days after LA, 5 days after OA, P < 0. 0001) than after OA. The operating time was shorter {OA: 25 min (median), LA: 28 min (median), 0. 01 < P < 0. 05 } in patients undergoing open appendicectomy compared to laparoscopic appendicectomy.
