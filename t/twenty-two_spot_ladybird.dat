50|$|Harmonia conformis (the large <b>spotted</b> <b>{{ladybird}})</b> is {{a species}} of ladybird (the family Coccinellidae). It has a light reddish appearance and its colouration includes 20 large black spots, 18 of which are found on the elytra (wing covers). They are quite large for ladybirds, being about 6-7 mm long. It is a predator of other insects, eating aphids as both a larva and imago (adult). It is found in Australia, and has been introduced to New Zealand, where it is common in northern regions. Another member of the same genus, Harmonia antipoda, also occurs in New Zealand. This species, however, is a native and is much smaller and harder to find.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPredation has {{immediate}} {{consequences for}} prey fitness and early assessment of predation risk may be advantageous for prey. We investigated {{the ability of}} the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), to detect one of its important predators, seven <b>spot</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Coccinella septempunctata L., via chemicals in the predator’s walking track. Ladybird tracks left on leaves elicited avoidance and reduced host plant settling in aphids via contact and olfactory cues or a combination of both. Aphid avoidance behavior was dependent on ladybird sex and number of individuals, with the odor of a single ladybird eliciting attraction and the odor of several ladybirds causing avoidance. This suggests that aphids may be able to assess the risk of predation via the extent of the chemical tracks and adjust their behavioral response accordingly. Aphid responses to ladybird tracks decreased with the age of the track, potentially preventing aphids from avoiding plants on which predators have not been recently active. This avoidance mechanism may {{play an important role in}} the biological control exerted by predatory ladybirds on aphid populations...|$|R
25|$|The atlas Ladybirds (Coccinellidae) of Britain and Ireland {{published}} in 2011 showed {{a decline of}} more than 20% in native species due to environmental changes and competition from foreign invaders.

The most commonly recorded species was the 7-spot, closely followed by the Asian harlequin— an invader that arrived from continental Europe in 2003 after being introduced to control pests. An 'explosion' in the number of orange ladybirds, which feed on mildew, is thought to have been due to the warmer, damper conditions that now prevail in parts of England.|$|R
40|$|Many studies {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} density of aphids below which ladybirds are unlikely to lay eggs. This is adaptive as theory indicates that a certain minimum population density of aphids is required if hatchling larvae are to survive.

Proportionally more of the ladybirds on plants with 50 aphids or that were previously infested with the same number of aphids for 48 hours laid eggs and larger clusters of eggs, and were less active than those on plants that were infested with or had previously been infested with five aphids.

40|$|Secondary plant {{metabolites}} (allelochemicals) play a {{major role}} in plant-insect interactions. Glucosinolates (GLS) and their degradation products from Brassica species are attractants and feeding stimulants for Brassicaceae specialist insects but are generally repellent and toxic for generalist herbivores. The impact of these compounds on crucifer specialist insects are well known but their effect on generalist predators is still not well documented. Prey host plant influence on reproduction of an aphidophagous beneficial, the two <b>spot</b> <b>ladybird,</b> was determined using the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae reared on a crucifer plant, namely Brassica napus containing low GLS levels. As ladybird developmental and reproductive parameters were already shown to be strongly affected by the allelochemical presence in its preys, the unsuitable aphid and host plant combination was only momentary used to feed the A. bipunctata adults. A strong impact of the diet was observed on the beetle fecundity and the emerging offspring. Changing B. brassicae aphid to a suitable prey slowly improved the temporary negative effect of the former diet. These results enhance the food environmental effect and the importance of tritrophic relations in pest management strategies by predators. Indeed, more than the choice of the beneficial species, the prey host plant has a major influence on the potential efficacy of biological agent to control herbivore species such as aphids.

40|$|This {{study used}} 2 DE to {{investigate}} how Arabidopsis thaliana modulates protein levels {{in response to}} freezing stress after sub-lethal exposure at - 10 °C, both in cold-acclimated and in non-acclimated plants. A map was implemented in which 62 spots, corresponding to 44 proteins, were identified. <b>Twenty-two</b> <b>spots</b> were modulated upon treatments, and the corresponding proteins proved {{to be related to}} photosynthesis, energy metabolism, and stress response. Proteins demonstrated differences between control and acclimation conditions. Most of the acclimation-responsive proteins were either not further modulated or they were down-modulated by freezing treatment, indicating that the levels reached during acclimation were sufficient to deal with freezing. Anabolic metabolism appeared to be down-regulated in favor of catabolic metabolism. Acclimated plants and plants submitted to freezing after acclimation showed greater reciprocal similarity in protein profiles than either showed when compared both to control plants and to plants frozen without acclimation. The response of non-acclimated plants was aimed at re-modulating photosynthetic apparatus activity, and at increasing the levels of proteins with antioxidant-, molecular chaperone-, or post-transcriptional regulative functions. These changes, even less effective than the acclimation strategy, might allow the injured plastids to minimize the production of non-useful metabolites and might counteract photosynthetic apparatus injuries. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Insects {{can detect}} cues {{related to the}} risk of attack by their natural enemies. Pathogens are among the natural enemies of insects and entomopathogenic fungi attack a wide array of host species. Evidence {{documents}} that social insects in particular have adapted behavioural mechanisms to avoid infection by fungal pathogens. These mechanisms are referred to as 'behavioural resistance'. However, there is little evidence for similar adaptations in non-social insects. We have conducted experiments to assess the potential of common insect predators to detect and avoid their entomopathogenic fungal natural enemy Beauveria bassiana. The predatory bug Anthocoris nemorum was able to detect and avoid nettle leaves that were treated with B. bassiana. Females laid fewer eggs on leaf halves contaminated with the pathogen. Similarly, females were very reluctant to contact nettle leaves contaminated with the fungus compared to uncontaminated control leaves in ‘no-choice’ experiments. Adult seven <b>spot</b> <b>ladybirds,</b> Coccinella septempunctata, overwinter in the litter layer often in groups. Adult C. septempunctata modified their overwintering behaviour in relation to the presence of B. bassiana conidia in soil and sporulating conspecifics by moving away from sources of infection. Furthermore active (non-overwintering) adult C. septempunctata were also able to detect and avoid B. bassiana conidia on different substrates; bean leaves, soil and sporulating on dead conspecifics. Our studies show that insect predators have evolved mechanisms to detect and avoid pathogens that they are susceptible to. Fungal pathogens may be significant mortality factors among populations of insect predators, especially long-lived species that must diapause before reproduction. Likewise, actively foraging species are more likely to come in contact with pathogens than predators that sit and wait for prey. These particular groups of insects will benefit from adaptations to avoid pathogens. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is the commonest {{cause of}} vision loss {{in people with}} diabetes. Laser {{photocoagulation}} can be effective {{in the treatment of}} DMO; however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. A better understanding of these mechanisms may allow the development of therapeutic approaches that could avoid the deleterious adverse events associated with photocoagulation. Methods: We have used proteomic techniques to identify the protein changes induced by threshold intensity retinal laser treatment in a rodent model of diabetic retinopathy. Retinae were obtained from diabetic Dark Agouti rats 8 weeks following laser treatment. Extracted proteins from lasered and non-lasered diabetic retinae were separated and compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Results: Image analysis revealed 24 protein spots with decreased expression after laser treatment and 9 spots with increased expression. On lasered retinal gels, four spots were uniquely expressed, with eight unique spots on non-lasered gels. <b>Twenty-two</b> protein <b>spots</b> of interest were identified using matrix-assisted desorption ionization-mass spectrometry with database matching. Following laser, Wnt- 5 beta, LEK- 1, GADPH, claudin- 12 and calretinin were significantly down-regulated in expression. Conclusions: The present study provides a proteomic insight into the underlying biological basis for the therapeutic effects of laser for DMO. We provide further evidence of the involvement of Wnt pathway signalling in the neural retina in DMO, and for up to 2 months following laser treatment. Changes in LEK- 1 and claudin- 12 may have effector roles, and changes in glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and calretinin may reflect the altered retinal microenvironment resulting from laser treatment. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www 3. interscience. wiley. comEpithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading {{cause of cancer death}} among women. Due to the asymptomatic nature and poor survival characteristic of the disease, screening for specific biomarkers for ovarian cancer is a major health priority. Differentially expressed proteins in the serum of ovarian cancer patients have the potential to be used as cancer-specific biomarkers. In this study, proteomic methods were used to screen 24 serum samples from women with high-grade ovarian cancer and compared to a control group of 11 healthy women. Affigel-Blue treated serum samples were processed either by linear (pH 4 - 7) or narrow range (pH 5. 5 - 6. 7) IEF strips for the first dimension. Proteins separated in first dimension were resolved by 8 - 16 % gradient SDS-PAGE. Protein spots were visualized by SYPRO Ruby staining, imaged by FX-imager and compared and analyzed by PDQuest software. <b>Twenty-two</b> protein <b>spots</b> were consistently differentially expressed between normal and ovarian cancer patients by resolving proteins in a linear pH strip of 4 - 7 for the first dimension. Six of the protein spots, significantly up-regulated in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients (p < 0. 05), were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and Western blotting as the isoforms of haptoglobin precursor. When serum proteins were resolved on narrow pH range strips (5. 5 - 6. 7), 23 spots were consistently differentially expressed between normal and grade 3 ovarian cancer patients. Of these, 4 protein spots significantly down regulated in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients (p < 0. 05) were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and Western blotting, as isoforms of transferrin precursor. Increased expression of serum haptoglobin and transferrin was also identified in peritoneal tumor fluid obtained from women diagnosed with grade 2 / 3 ovarian cancer (n = 7). Changes in the expression of haptoglobin and transferrin in the serum of women with different pathological grades of ovarian cancer was examined by one-dimensional Western blotting method. Serum samples collected from women suffering from benign, borderline, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 cancer (n = 4 for haptoglobin and n = 5 for transferrin in each group) were analyzed and compared to the serum of normal healthy women. The mean serum haptoglobin expression in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients was fourfold higher than in the control subjects (p < 0. 05). On the other hand, transferrin expression in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients was decreased by twofold than in normal healthy women (p < 0. 05). Haptoglobin expression in the serum of cancer patients (n = 7) decreased following chemotherapy (six cycles of taxol/carboplatin). Concomitant with the decrease of haptoglobin, transferrin expression remained constant in four patients, but increased in three out of seven patients included in the study. Changes in serum expression of haptoglobin correlated with the change of CA 125 levels before and after chemotherapy. In conclusion, proteomic profiling of differentially expressed proteins in the sera of normal women compared to women with ovarian cancer can greatly facilitate the discovery of a panel of biomarkers that may aid in the detection of ovarian cancer with greater specificity.

40|$|Ladybird beetles {{produce a}} range of {{alkaloid}} compounds which are found a high concentration in the haemolymph and released in response to perceived threat. These alkaloids are thought to function as agents of chemical defence and a small number {{have been shown to}} antagonise the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. As intraguild predators, the chemical defence may be under selective pressure from other predatory insects, the alkaloids may therefore have evolved to target insects predominantly. To discover if other ladybird alkaloids show activity at nAChRs and investigate mode of action, alkaloids were extracted from 7 -spot, 10 -spot, 14 -spot, cream spot, pine, orange and harlequin ladybird beetles and purified with acid-base separation. These species are each known to produce a different subset of alkaloids. Their action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was investigated by constructing concentration-inhibition plots by co-applying alkaloid extracts with acetylcholine to human embryonic muscle-type of TE 671 cells and locust neuronal nAChRs. Peak current, net-charge and late (1 s) current were measured with whole-cell patch-clamp at VH = - 75 mV. All alkaloid extracts antagonised the ACh responses of both cell types but potency and selectivity varied. The late current was the most strongly affected current parameter and the most potent antagonists of locust 1 s currents were alkaloids produced by 10 -spot, 7 -spot, pine and harlequin ladybird with IC 50 s ranging from 0. 29 – 0. 76 μg/mL. The 14 -spot, cream <b>spot</b> and orange <b>ladybird</b> alkaloids had higher IC 50 s, ranging from 1. 6 - 4. 9 μg/mL. The IC 50 values calculated for all species with, the exception of harlequin and orange ladybirds were significantly lower for locust than human nAChRs and these ranged from 1. 3 – 47. 8 μg/mL. The alkaloid extract that showed the highest selectivity for locust nAChRs was that of the 7 -spot ladybird, with an IC 50 value 58. 4 fold lower. The alkaloids of the 10 -spot, 14 -spot, cream <b>spot</b> and pine <b>ladybird</b> also showed significantly higher potency for locust nAChRs over human nAChRs with IC 50 s 10. 3 – 35 fold lower. Orange and harlequin ladybird alkaloids did not show higher potency for locust nAChRs. Harlequin ladybird alkaloids were highly potent to the nAChRs of both cell types whereas orange ladybird alkaloids showed low activity. The differences in potency correspond with differences in ecology, with the species that showed highest insect potency often found in close association with other predatory ladybird species. Those that showed low insect potency are arboreal specialists that are less likely to encounter insect predators. To investigate mode of action, ACh concentration-response curves in the presence and absence of harlequin ladybird alkaloid extract were constructed using TE 671 cells. Increasing ACh concentrations were unable to overcome the inhibition caused by this alkaloid extract, indicating non-competitive action. Fitting the Woodhull equation to IC 50 values calculated at holding potentials of 50, - 50, - 75, - 100 and - 120 mV revealed that the antagonism caused by this alkaloid extract was voltagedependent (P = 0. 012), with late current IC 50 s of 23. 1, 15. 5 and 6 μg/mL at holding potentials of + 50, - 50 and - 120 mV respectively. These data indicate that the active alkaloid(s) within this extract bind at an allosteric site and the strong voltagedependence of inhibition suggests mode of action is open-channel block rather than enhancement of desensitisation. The alkaloid harmonine was separated from other components of the alkaloid extract by thin-layer chromatography and the inhibitory activity tested against both human and locust nAChRs at VH = - 75 mV. Both fractions were found to be active and displayed similar inhibitory activity towards human nAChRs with IC 50 s of 1. 68 μg/mL for harmonine and 4. 77 μg/mL for other alkaloid compounds. Harmonine was found to be significantly more potent towards locust nAChRs with an IC 50 of 0. 072 μg/mL as opposed to 3. 23 μg/mL. This could indicate that harlequin ladybirds produce several alkaloids with different functions; harmonine may act as a chemical defence compound targeted towards insect predators. The alkaloid extract of the 10 -spot ladybird was found to show significantly higher potency towards locust nAChRs than human. One of two alkaloids produced by this species is (-) -adaline. Synthetic (-) -adaline displayed identical inhibitory activity towards both cell types as the alkaloid extract of the 10 -spot ladybird. Potency was significantly higher towards locust nAChRs than human, with IC 50 s of 10. 26 – 45. 83 μM against human and 0. 55 – 2. 97 μM against locust nAChRs. ACh concentration-response curves showed that (-) -adaline acts non-competitively and IC 50 values at different holding potentials reveal that it is strongly voltage-dependent (P = 0. 003 in human and P = 0. 007 in locust nAChRs) and inactive at positive holding potentials. As with the alkaloid extract of the harlequin ladybird, this alkaloid acts as a non-competitive negative allosteric modulator which shows higher potency for locust over human nAChRs and strong voltage-dependence of inhibition, consistent with open-channel block. A structurally diverse range of ladybird alkaloids displayed inhibitory activity towards both human and insect nAChRs. This inhibition was non-competitive and voltage-dependent for both harlequin ladybird alkaloid extract and adaline, indicating that these alkaloids act as negative allosteric modulators, possibly open-channel blockers. The majority of ladybird alkaloid extracts tested were significantly more potent towards insect than human nAChRs. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the activity of these compounds is restricted to the nAChRs, or whether they act as non-selective pore blockers. Ladybird alkaloids appear to represent a library of novel nAChR antagonists, some of which could be further investigated as potential insecticide leads...|$|R
