25|$|Sometime around 1873, British swimmer John Arthur Trudgen {{learned the}} front crawl from native South Americans {{during a trip}} to Argentina. However, Trudgen applied the more common sidestroke (scissor) kick instead of the flutter kick used by the Native Americans. This hybrid stroke was called the <b>Trudgen</b> <b>stroke.</b> Because of its speed, this stroke quickly became popular.|$|E
2500|$|This {{style was}} further {{improved}} by the Australian champion swimmer, Richmond [...] "Dick" [...] Cavill (the son of swimming instructor Professor Richard [...] "Frederick" [...] Cavill) {{who developed the}} stroke with his brother [...] "Tums". They were later inspired by Alick Wickham, a young Solomon Islander living in Sydney who swam {{a version of the}} crawl stroke that was popular in his home island at Roviana lagoon. [...] The Cavills then modified their swimming stroke using this as inspiration and this modified <b>Trudgen</b> <b>stroke</b> became known as the [...] "Australian crawl".|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Trudgen</b> <b>stroke</b> was {{improved}} by Australian-born Richmond Cavill. Cavill, whose father Frederick Cavill narrowly failed to swim the English Channel, {{is credited with}} developing the stroke after observing a young boy from the Solomon Islands. Cavill and his brothers spread the Australian crawl to England, New Zealand and America. Richmond used this stroke in 1902 at an International Championships in England to set a new world record by out swimming all Trudgen swimmers over the 100 yd in 0:58.4 ...|$|E

50|$|George Hodgson, Canada's only Olympic {{gold medal}} winner in {{swimming}} until 1984, did not stay in competition very long. He won two gold medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, with times of 5:24.4s in the 400-metre and 22:00.0s in the 1500-metre freestyle. He had already set {{a world record}} of 22:23.0 {{in the first round}} of the race. He was eighteen at the time and retired immediately after one of the great races of all time. His unprecedented success was widely attributed to his innovation of the <b>trudgen</b> <b>stroke,</b> a hybrid between the front crawl and sidestroke.|$|E
5000|$|Charlton {{first came}} to public {{attention}} in 1921 when he won a 440 yd freestyle race in the open division at a New South Wales Swimming Association competition in 5 min 45 s. It was his youth {{that led to his}} nickname [...] "Boy". In 1922 Bill Harris, the bronze medallist in the 100m freestyle at the 1920 Summer Olympics, came to Australia from Honolulu to compete against the likes of Frank Beaurepaire and Moss Christie. Charlton defeated Harris at the New South Wales Championships, winning the 440 yd in 5 min 22.4 s. He then set a world record of 11m 5.4s in the 880yd event, as well as winning the one mile race in 23 min 43.2 s. Charlton used a <b>trudgen</b> <b>stroke</b> which embodied characteristics of the modern crawl stroke, which was at the time in its infancy.|$|E
50|$|The son of George Matson and {{his wife}} Emma (née Duffield), Matson was educated at state school in Adelaide before moving to Western Australia as a youth. There, {{he worked as a}} navvies' water-boy and began {{swimming}} competitively in 1902 and playing Australian football. During his swimming career, he held Western Australian freestyle titles from 100 yards (91 m) to a mile (1.6 km) using the now-obsolete <b>trudgen</b> <b>stroke.</b> He won the 220-yard breaststroke at the Australasian championships in the three years between 1905 and 1907, and eventually set a world record time for the event of three minutes and fourteen seconds. However, playing professional football at the same time precluded him from considering the Olympic Games, so he turned professional for a £20 stake in 1909. Matson married his cousin Gertrude Ethel Jean Pope in 1907 at Boulder, Western Australia, but they later separated.|$|E
