40|$|Background: Distal radius {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common fractures seen in the hospital emergency department. Of these, over 40 % are considered unstable and require some form of fixation. In recent years with the advent of low profile plating, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using volar plates has become the surgical treatment of choice in many hospitals. However, it is currently unknown which plating system has the lowest complication rate and/or superior clinical and radiological outcomes following surgery. Few studies have compared different types of plates, which may have various features, different plate and screw designs or may be manufactured from different materials (for example, stainless steel or titanium). This study will specifically investigate and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes and complication rates of two commonly used volar plating systems for fixation of distal radius fractures: one made from stainless steel (<b>Trimed</b> (TM) Volar Plate, <b>Trimed</b> (TM), California, USA) and the other made from titanium (Medartis (R) Aptus Volar Plate, Medartis (R), Basel, Switzerland).

40|$|Neutron scattering, capacitance, {{and time}} domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) methods of soil water content measurement were compared {{in a wide variety}} of soils and environments. Comparisons aimed to establish the accuracy and precision of each method and particular device, the need for and amenability of the device to soil-specific calibration, the volume of measurement, and conditions of successful use. Measurements were made in a soil in Australia, three soils in Austria, five soils in France, two soils in Tunisia, and three soils in the United States. Except for conventional TDR, the devices were used in access tubes. Several experiments included gravimetric sampling. Devices tested included the soil moisture neutron probe (SMNP), Sentek EnviroSCAN and Diviner 2000 capacitance probes, the IMKO <b>Trime</b> tube probe, and conventional TDR systems from Soil Moisture Inc., Tektronix, Inc. and Dynamax, Inc. The Sentek, IMKO, Delta-T and SMNP devices all required soil-specific calibration. The conventional TDR systems were reasonably accurate without calibration. Due to their small measurement volume, installation of access tubes without soil disturbance outside of the tube was critical for success with the Sentek, IMKO, and Delta-T devices, but not for the SMNP. Successful tube installation was difficult with the smaller diameter devices (< 30 mm), and was difficult in some soils for all devices except the SMNP. Access tubes available from the manufacturers for the Sentek, IMKO, and Delta-T devices were expensive compared with access tubes for the SMNP. Preliminary calibration vs. gravimetric sampling resulted in coefficients of determination (r) values of 0. 42 and 0. 53 in two Austrian soils for the Diviner.
