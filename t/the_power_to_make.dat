5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{execution}} of a commission for the Hospital de Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on 7 April 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed that his son should have <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament (El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.|$|E

Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became {{more interested in the}} topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E

5|$|The ADF's legal {{standing}} {{draws on the}} executive government sections of the Australian Constitution.

5|$|At the 1911 Imperial Conference Australia {{expressed}} concern about Japan's growing naval power and {{it was agreed that}} the British government would consult Australia when negotiating renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It was also decided that the Royal Navy would continue to support the RAN and provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and that if there was war the ships of the RAN would be transferred to British Admiralty control. Under the Naval Defence Act (1912) <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the transfer was conferred in the Governor-General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the British Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training.|$|E

Khánh's contended that only a full sitting of the Armed Forces Council, him included, had <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a leadership change. Khánh told Cao of his intention to resist what he saw as an illegal seizure of power. Having concluded that Khánh would fight to the bitter end, Cao went and saw Westmoreland in an open request for help. Westmoreland sent Rowland to meet with the eight available members of the AFCKỳ, Thi, Cao, Thiệu, Minh, Khang, Có and Phạm Văn Đồngto devise a plan to thwart Khánh’s attempts to reestablish himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
5|$|Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if {{written law}} confers power on a {{minister}} {{to give a}} direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered {{to exercise a power}} or perform a duty to, {{in the absence of any}} statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the power or perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice); may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the Government Gazette. The minister remains capable of exercising the power or performing the duty personally. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.|$|E
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E

5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E
