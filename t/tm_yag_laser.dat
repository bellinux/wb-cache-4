40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} (1) {{the scalp}} topography of ultralate laser evoked potentials (LEPs) related to C-fibre activation, which can directly {{be obtained by}} thulium YAG (<b>Tm</b> <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> stimulation of tiny skin surface areas (about 0. 23 mm(2)) and (2) {{the influence of the}} performance of a motor task on ultralate LEPs. METHODS: Laser stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the left hand. LEPs were recorded with 58 scalp electrodes from 9 healthy subjects in two different conditions, with and without a reaction time (RT) task (press a button upon detection). RESULTS: On high resolution electroenchephalogram recordings, ultralate LEPs were characterized by a broad positive component (peak latency: 1133 +/- 91 ms) with maximum amplitude about the vertex. Moreover, the performance of a RT task had no influence on latency, amplitude and topographical patterns of two maps chosen at the positive peak latency in ultralate LEPs. Nevertheless, a negative inflexion (latency 1300 ms) appeared after the positive component in the task condition possibly reflecting movement-related potentials. CONCLUSION: <b>Tm</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> stimulation of tiny skin surface areas allows recording the dynamic scalp topography of ultralate (C-fibres) LEPs, with or without the performance of a RT task...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{ablation}} {{of dental}} hard tissues {{by means of}} the erbium:yttrium-aluminum garnet (Er: <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> has been reported recently, and its application to caries removal and cavity preparation has been expected. However, few studies have investigated the morphological changes in hard dental tissues after Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> caries treatment. In the present study the morphological changes in hard dental tissues after Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> caries ablation in vitro was compared with that of conventional mechanical treatment. Thirty extracted human teeth with caries were used. Ten tooth was treated with the Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser,</b> and the other was treated with a conventional steel and diamond burs. Laser treatment was performed by means of a non-contact irradiation modes with cooling water spray, with a new Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> (LiteTouch). Conventional bur treatment was conducted by means of a low-speed micromotor and air turbine with water cooling. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were performed for each treatment. The Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> ablated carious dentin effectively with minimal thermal damage to the surrounding intact dentin, and removed infected and softened carious dentin to the same degree as the burtreatment. In addition, a lower degree of vibration was noted with the Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treatment. The SEM examination revealed characteristic micro-irregularities of the lased dentin and enamel surfaces with potential benefits for adhesive restorations.

Study design. Forty maxillary central incisors were instrumented and obturated. The roots were divided into 4 groups according to the root resection method (Zekrya bur or Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> - 1. 8 W, 450 mJ, 4 Hz, 113 J/cm(2)) and further surface treatment (none or Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> - 2. 0 W, 100 mJ, 20 Hz, 124 J/cm(2)). The teeth were prepared for SEM analysis. Scores ranging from 1 to 4 were attributed to cut quality and morphological changes. The data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and by Dunn`s test. Results. SEM images showed irregular surfaces on the apical portions resected with Zekrya burs, with smear layer and grooves in the resected dentine and slight gutta-percha displacement and plasticization. On the other hand, apicectomies carried out with Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> showed morphological changes compatible with ablated dentine, with rough surfaces and craters. In spite {{of the presence of}} plasticized gutta-percha, with the presence of bubbles, an irregular adaptation of the filling material to the root walls was also observed. Direct Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation of the apical and buccal surfaces of the resected roots resulted in areas of resolidification and fusion in the dentine and cementum, with a vitrified aspect; indirect Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation of the palatal surfaces yielded a lower number of changes in the cementum, with irregular resolidification areas.

40|$|Background: Striae distensae or {{stretch marks}} are atrophic linear dermal scars with {{epidermal}} atrophy. There are many therapeutic options for management, but no consistently effective modality is available yet. Objective: We compared {{the efficacy of}} 1064 nm long pulse (LP) Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and 2940 nm variable square pulse (VSP) erbium: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> {{in the treatment of}} striae distensae. Methods: Twenty female volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin types II-V) aged between 20 and 40 years with striae (3 patients with the rubra type and 17 with the alba type) were enrolled in the study. The duration of striae ranged from 4 months to 12 years. Lesions were located on the abdomen in all patients except one patient who had striae on the arms and two patients with striae in the lumbar region. Treatments were randomly allocated to both sides of the body in each patient, one side being treated with VSP erbium: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and the opposite side with LP Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser.</b> All subjects were treated monthly for a total of three treatments. Two 3 -mm punch biopsies were obtained from six subjects, both of the same striae, one before the first treatment and one 4 weeks after the last session. Results: Response was evaluated clinically by photographic comparison and was found to be poor in 17 subjects, both on the LP Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treated side and VSP erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treated side.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Granular cell tumor (GCT) {{is a rare}} lesion. Approximately 4 % to 6 % {{of these}} tumors occur in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, one-third of them affecting the esophagus. Almost all GCTs are benign lesions. Approximately 1 % to 3 % are malignant. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a diagnostic support. The best treatment for esophageal GCT is not yet clear, whether surgical excision, periodic observation, endoscopic excision, or yttrium-aluminum-garnet (<b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> therapy. METHODS: From November 1992 to December 2000, four patients with GCTs of the esophagus were observed. All the patients underwent EUS evaluation and endoscopic <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy of the esophageal neoplasm. At each session, a biopsy at the tumor site was obtained. The treatment was continued until endoscopic and histologic evidence of the tumor disappeared.

40|$|High power yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (<b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> {{was employed}} for the effective surface modification of metals and composites. SiC whisker, reinforced aluminum composite {{was treated with}} a continuous wave <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. No Al 4 C 3, which was detrimental to the corrosion resistance of Al-SiC composites, was formed during laser treatment. This was attributed to the high thermal stability of SiC whiskers that was inherited from their essentially perfect single-crystal structures and the fast cooling condition in laser processing.

40|$|Background: Acne scar is a {{complication}} of inflammatory acne {{due to the}} damage of skin. Various therapeutic modalities {{have been used for}} the treatment of acne scars. Among these treatments, minimal ablative fractional Er: <b>YAG</b> (Erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet) <b>laser</b> is a popular treatment modality for the improvement of acne scars. In this study, we restrospectively analysed efficiency and tolerability of minimal ablative fractional Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy in the treatment of acne scars. Materials and Methods: Seventy one patients with acne scars treated with minimal ablative fractional Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> in our clinic between November 2011 and April 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Treatment parameters, demographic features and before and after pictures of the lesions were investigated from patients’ records in order to evaluate efficency of Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy. Patients’ photographs before and after treatment were compared. Clinical response was graded according to the percentage improvement. Side effects observed during treatment and in follow-up visits were evaluated from patients’ records. Results: Acne scar types included in the study were icepick (n= 32, 45. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of nevus sebaceous to undergo malignant change has prompted many physicians to undertake surgical excision of these lesions. Debulking surgery would leave an ugly scar, cosmetically not acceptable. Our {{aim was to}} find the therapeutic outcome and the final cosmetic appearance with Erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>Laser</b> ablation. A 19 year old boy with histologically proven Nevus Sebaceous over the forehead was taken up for ablation using Erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>Laser.</b> We also analyzed the post-operative results in another 6 patients who underwent Laser ablation of Nevus Sebaceous. All 7 patients did well, with no signs of recurrence. Also, {{all of them had}} a scar over the ablated area, which was cosmetically acceptable to them. Surgical excision with or without flap rotation, electro fulguration and Cryotherapy are other modalities to treat these lesions. However, they are either too expensive or leave a telltale scar. Erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>Laser</b> ablation is safe, effective and cosmetically acceptable in the treatment of Nevus Sebaceous...|$|R
40|$|Background: According to {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of myopia in Taiwan, we analyze the adopted cataract extractions, identify predicting factors for postoperative vision, and to assess the incidence of retinal complications after Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> capsulotomy in high myopic eyes. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five eyes, which the axial lengths were longer than 26 mm, following cataract extraction were enrolled. Surgeries adopted included phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation, extracapsu-lar cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, phacoemulsifica-tion, and extracapsular cataract extraction. Logistic regression was utilized to assess predictive factors for postoperative vision. Results: Postoperative vision of 41 eyes (32. 8 %) of the 125 high myopic eyes improved at least 4 lines of Snellen acuity. Thirty-two eyes (25. 6 %) achieved good postoperative vision (BCVA≥ 20 / 40), and 26 eyes (20. 8 %) demonstrated poor postoperative vision (BCVA< 20 / 200). Younger age and shorter axial length were appreciated for better visual outcome (p < 0. 05). Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> capsulotomy is required for posterior capsular opacity. Three in 125 eyes (2. 4 %) developed retinal complications and 2 of them had retinal detachment subsequently within one month after Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> capsuloto-my. Conclusion: Most high myopic patients achieved visual improvement after cataract surg-eries. Age and axial length are the predictive factors in high myopic patients. It is crucial to examine retina prior to Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> capsulotomy to prevent retinal complication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Syringoma is {{a benign}} adnexal tumor of the skin, {{predominantly}} involving the periorbital areas {{which can cause}} significant cosmetic concerns for affected individuals. An ideal treatment of syringoma is selective destruction with little damage to the normal tissue which literally impossible for the conventional treatment modalities. The fractional erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (erbium <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> utilized {{in this study is}} unique that it has adjustable depth and coagulation parameters. The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the efficacy and safety of fractional erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> for treating periorbital syringomas. Ten patients with biopsy-proven periorbital syringomas were treated with 3 sessions of fractional erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> at 6 -week interval. Clinical evaluation performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after last treatment using photographic comparison revealed grade 4 clearance in 7 cases and grade 3 clearance in 3 cases. The clinical improvement scores at 1, 3 and 6 months after the last laser treatment were significantly different (p< 0. 05). Patient satisfaction was evaluated at 6 months post laser treatment with result of very satisfied in 4 cases and satisfied in 5 cases. No complications, such as scarring, erythema, and pigmentary changes, were observed. The authors concluded that the fractional Erbium <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> might be an alternative modality to treat periorbital syringoma to gain good cosmetic results without complications if applied repeatedly...|$|R
