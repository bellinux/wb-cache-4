5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from <b>the</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fusible plugs are {{sometimes}} fitted to the receivers of air compressors {{as a precaution}} against the ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present. Should the action of <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> heat the air above a safe temperature the core will melt and release the pressure.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of <b>the</b> <b>compressor.</b> A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did <b>the</b> <b>compressor,</b> combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in <b>the</b> <b>compressor,</b> reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned on either side of <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> stalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and <b>the</b> <b>Compressor</b> & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E
50|$|The plane {{departed}} from Stockholm at 08:47, {{on the day}} of the crash. Shortly after liftoff, pieces of ice slammed onto the fans of both engines, deforming the fan blades sufficiently to disturb the airflow to <b>the</b> <b>compressors.</b> <b>The</b> disturbed airflow caused <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> to stall and this in turn caused the engines to surge. Because the engines were not throttled down sufficiently, the surges continued. The high loads from repeated engine surges quickly led to the breakup of both engines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> IP <b>compressor</b> outlet {{corrected}} flow must match the entry {{corrected flow}} of <b>the</b> HP <b>compressor,</b> which is decreasing as {{the engine is}} throttled back. At a certain IP compressor working line slope, <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> outlet corrected flow remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower working line, <b>the</b> extra IP <b>compressor</b> pressure ratio at a given IP compressor entry corrected flow enables <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> outlet corrected flow to decrease and match up with <b>the</b> falling HP <b>compressor</b> entry corrected flow. Unfortunately {{this can lead to}} a poor IP compressor surge margin at part flow.|$|R
50|$|Subcooling {{phenomena}} {{is intimately}} related to efficiency in refrigeration systems. This {{has led to}} a lot of research on the field. Most of the interest is placed in the fact that some systems work in better conditions than others due to better (higher) operating pressures, and <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> that take part of a subcooling loop are usually more efficient than <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> that are having their liquid subcooled.|$|R
25|$|Mixing by {{continuous}} blending: measured {{quantities of}} oxygen {{are introduced to}} <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> inlet. <b>The</b> <b>compressor</b> and particularly <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> oil, must be suitable for this service.

50|$|At a given IP {{compressor}} pressure ratio, {{opening the}} blow-off valve forces <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> entry corrected flow to increase, {{to a point}} where <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> surge margin tends to be better. Effectively, opening the blow-off valve lowers <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> working line.

The blow-off valve is normally only opened at throttled conditions, since it wastes energy.|$|R
40|$|Case StudyCase Study 22 : Over a 13 ?year span, a major South American oil company?s {{maintenance}} department fought high vibrations in three gas reinjection compressor trains. To reduce {{the chances of}} machine trips, technicians field balanced <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> every year and replaced worn point contact pivot tilt pad journal (TPJ) bearings and O?ring squeeze film dampers (SFDs) with new ones yearly. The downtime from implementing these preventative measures and from actual trips in the trains resulted {{in a loss of}} capacity of 1 % a year and additional flaring of the gas. After a thorough analysis of <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> and inspection of damaged components, it was determined that the reoccurring problems would be solved by installing optimized Flexure Pivot tilt pad journal bearings with Integral Squeeze Film Damper (ISFD) technology into <b>the</b> <b>compressors.</b> In 2013 <b>the</b> reinjection <b>compressors</b> were placed back into service with Flexure Pivot TPJ bearings with ISFD technology.

25|$|In {{hermetic}} {{and most}} semi-hermetic compressors, <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> and motor driving <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor {{is designed to}} operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{jet engine}} application, <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> faces {{a wide variety}} of {{operating}} conditions. On the ground at takeoff the inlet pressure is high, inlet speed zero, and <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> spun at a variety of speeds as the power is applied. Once in flight the inlet pressure drops, but the inlet speed increases (due to the forward motion of the aircraft) to recover some of this pressure, and <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> tends to run at a single speed for long periods of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{internal}} gearbox {{is complicated by the}} heat and small space available in which to connect the driveshaft.

25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because <b>the</b> <b>compressor's</b> input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and <b>the</b> <b>compressor's</b> dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes <b>the</b> <b>compressor's</b> dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|R
50|$|Economizer capable screw {{compressors}} are being built, which require particular manufacturing finesse. These systems {{are capable of}} injecting refrigerant that comes from an internal heat exchanger instead of the main evaporator, in the last portion of the compressing screws. In the named heat exchanger, refrigerant liquid at high pressure is subcooled, resulting in mechanical subcooling. There is also a huge quantity of systems being built in booster display. This is similar to economizing, as <b>the</b> <b>compressor's</b> efficiency of one of <b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> (<b>the</b> one working on higher pressures) {{is known to be}} better than <b>the</b> other (<b>the</b> <b>compressors</b> working with lower pressures). Economizers and booster systems usually differ {{in the fact that the}} first ones are able to do the same subcooling using only one compressor able to economize, the latter systems must do the process with two separate compressors.|$|R

25|$|The {{flow range}} of a {{turbocharger}} compressor can be increased by allowing air to bleed from a ring of holes or a circular groove around <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> at a point slightly downstream of <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> inlet (but far nearer to the inlet than to the outlet).|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that when <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> is lowering the signal to the desired ratio it is lowering the entire signal, so that <b>the</b> <b>compressor</b> is still working even after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, for an amount of time determined by the release.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that toxic additives, such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon lubricants, will enter the cylinders from the diving air compressor.

50|$|Increasing overall {{pressure}} ratio implies raising <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>compressor</b> exit temperature.

50|$|Surge margin can be {{improved}} by adding variable stators to <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> and/or adding a blow-off valve between the IP and HP <b>compressors.</b> <b>The</b> former makes <b>the</b> IP <b>compressor</b> surge line shallower, swinging {{it away from the}} shallow working line, thus improving IP compressor surge margin.|$|R
