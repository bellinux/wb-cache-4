5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore {{both male and}} female phase syconia at the same time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.|$|E

People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E

50|$|The {{people used}} {{virtually}} {{all parts of}} the body and skin. The women prepared the meat for food: by boiling, roasting or drying for jerky. This processed it to last a long time without spoiling, and they depended on bison meat to get <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>winters</b> were long, harsh, and cold {{due to the lack of}} trees in the Plains, so people stockpiled meat in summer. As a ritual, hunters often ate the bison heart minutes after the kill. The women tanned and prepared the skins to cover the tepees. These were made of log poles, with the skins draped over it. The tepee remained warm in <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> and cool in the summer, and was a great shield against the wind.|$|R
5|$|Kilner's bowling {{had greater}} success in 1921, helping Yorkshire {{to rise to}} third in the Championship. Used more regularly, he took 61 wickets (average 18.80), {{including}} his first five-wicket hauls in an innings]], against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire. He scored 1,137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.73. He made centuries in the two matches against Northamptonshire, sharing big partnerships in both games: 276 with Rhodes in the first and 299 with Percy Holmes in the second. His overall performance left him sixth in the Yorkshire batting averages, and fourth in the bowling averages. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> he continued to develop his bowling.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic {{and more}} {{traditional}} Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time. In the Eastern Catholic Church, green {{is the color}} of Pentecost. Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped for their ability to maintain their color <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is used to represent Catholics, while orange is used to represent Protestantism. This is shown on the national flag of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from a natural spring located along a trail on {{the south end of}} the park. The spring's name is derived from the effect of {{sunlight}} on its surface, which makes the pool appear to shimmer like silver. Even <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> the bubbling spring never freezes, and plants often poke through snow surrounding the watercress-bordered pool in the coldest months. Three miles of the Fox River, which Silver Springs empties into, flows through the park's north end.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the Somaliland Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration {{was seeking to}} restore British control over the inland areas of the Protectorate.

Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and make his way home.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the siege}} of Berat {{continued}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 1280/1281. By early December, the Angevin forces had seized a number of outlying forts around the city and penetrated its suburbs. Charles, however, remained anxious to take the city before the Byzantine relief force arrived. He ordered his governors in Albania to direct all their resources towards the siege, and displayed his close interest {{by a series of}} letters to Sully, instructing him to take the city by assault if necessary. The Byzantine force advanced cautiously, and arrived in the area in early spring 1281. The megas domestikos Tarchaneiotes avoided a direct confrontation and relied on ambushes and raids instead. He also managed to resupply the besieged fortress with provisions, which were loaded onto rafts and then left to float down the river Osum which flows by the citadel.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, with Test {{vacancies}} beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training {{partners and}} decided to bowl for three hours continuously {{on a daily basis}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> off season. With Ray Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced. It was a heavy burden on Davidson, who had only taken two Test wickets in an innings four times, and three wickets in a Test match on one occasion. The team was to be led by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.|$|E
5|$|Robert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had {{inherited}} the castle {{by the time}} of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.|$|E
