5|$|In 1944, led by {{standout}} halfback Bill Paschal, whose 737 {{rushing yards}} and 54 points led the team, the Giants reached {{the championship game}} where they faced the Green Bay Packers {{for the third time}} in 10 seasons. They lost again, this time 14–7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns and the Packers defense was able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants.|$|E
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million. While they tried <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening {{as long as they}} could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E

5|$|In September 1459 Warwick {{crossed over}} to England {{and made his}} way north to Ludlow to meet up with Salisbury, the latter fresh from his victory over Lancastrians at the battle of Blore Heath, and York. At nearby Ludford Bridge their forces were {{scattered}} by the king's army, partly because of the defection of Warwick's Calais contingent under the command of Andrew Trollope. As it turned out, the majority of the soldiers were still reluctant to raise arms against the king. Forced to flee the country, York left for Dublin, Ireland, with his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais, accompanied by the duke's son, Edward, Earl of March (the future King Edward IV). Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, was appointed to replace Warwick as Captain of Calais, but the Yorkists managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the convention, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race, casting himself as the standard-bearer of the Robert Kennedy legacy. As the 1968 Democratic National Convention started, Humphrey stated that he had more than enough delegates to secure the nomination, but {{commentators}} questioned the campaign's ability <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> delegates. The Texas delegation announced frustration at the McCarthy campaign's attempts to change procedures, and declared that they might renominate President Johnson as a result. Observers noted that Humphrey's delegates were supporters of Johnson, and could follow suit. Meanwhile, protests and sleep-ins were held {{in the streets and}} parks of Chicago, forcing Mayor Richard J. Daley to order federal troops into the city. Eventually, 6,000 federal troops and 18,000 Illinois National Guardsmen were outside the convention, defending the premises. A televised debate was held featuring Humphrey, McCarthy and McGovern. Humphrey hoped to unite the party during the debate, affirming his support for peace in Vietnam, but his challengers were received better by the crowd, drawing more applause.|$|E

5|$|Steve DeBerg {{opened the}} second half with an 84-yard drive ending in a touchdown, and {{followed}} that with a touchdown pass to Gerald Carter a minute later. The game nearly became {{a repeat of the}} previous week, as the Packers replaced quarterback Don Majkowski with Randy Wright. Wright's two fourth-quarter touchdowns cut into Tampa Bay's 23–3 lead, but this time the offense was able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball. Two Calvin Magee catches for first downs sealed the victory. The Buccaneers' 17second-half points are credited to the coaching staff's adjustment to the Packers' man-to-man defense. The Buccaneers and Packers both had the same amount of net yards (279), passing yards (190), and rushing yards (89). Donald Igwebuike's three field goals broke Bill Capece's Buccaneer career record. The victory left the Buccaneers in second place in the NFC Central division. This led to speculation as to whether coach Perkins, who had been able to lead the New York Giants to the playoffs in three years as their coach, would be able to repeat the feat in a single year with Tampa Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively, for a {{worldwide}} total of $792 million with North America accounting for $435 million. It held the global record {{until it was}} surpassed by Jurassic Park—another Spielberg-directed film—in 1993, although it managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domestic record for a further four years, where a Star Wars reissue reclaimed it. It was eventually released on VHS and laserdisc on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75 million. In 1991, Sears began selling E.T. videocassettes exclusively at their stores {{as part of a}} holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and Laserdisc again in 1996. The Laserdisc included a 90-minute documentary. Produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau, it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams and other cast and crew members. It also included two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the Laserdisc.|$|E
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E

5|$|Their time in Japan {{was only}} {{the first of many}} {{international}} tours for these third generation Kangaroos; they worked all over Asia as well as in Costello's homeland of Australia. In 1969, the Kangaroos wrestled for the newly created Eastern Sports Association (ESA) out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they were once again recognized as champions on their arrival, becoming the inaugural holders of the ESA International Tag Team Championship. On 5 August 1969, the Kangaroos dropped the titles to Eastern Sports Association mainstays The Beast and Rudy Kay. In 1970, they joined Dick the Bruiser’s World Wrestling Association (WWA), where they competed regularly for nearly two years. On 26 December 1970 Costello and Kent defeated WWA World Tag Team Champions Dick the Bruiser and Bill Miller to claim the tag titles. The Kangaroos used every dirty tactic <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gold for six months before losing the titles to Wilbur Snyder and Moose Cholak. On 18 June 1971, the Kangaroos regained the titles, and held them for just over two months before Wilbur Snyder and Paul Christy beat them for their straps. After leaving the WWA, Costello and Kent made a few appearances in New York for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), a promotion the original Fabulous Kangaroos (Al Costello and Roy Hefferman) had previously worked for under the company's former name, Capitol Wrestling. In one of their headline appearances at Madison Square Garden, the Kangaroos wrestled to a 45-minute time limit draw against Terry and Dory Funk, Sr..|$|E
