This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra frame strut towards the rear and normal to the lower girder.|$|E

All of this work meant that Celtic had more covered terracing than any other stadium in Britain, except Wembley. There were 4,800 seats, all in the Main Stand, in an overall capacity of 80,000. A further 3,900 seats were installed in the Main Stand paddock area in 1971. A new roof was erected over the Main Stand in 1971, which cost £250,000.

40|$|Abstract — Post-tensioned simply {{supported}} pre-stressed concrete (PC) I-girder bridges {{are widely used}} bridge system for short to medium span (20 m to 50 m) highway bridges due to its moderate self-weight, structural efficiency, ease of fabrication, low maintenance etc. In order to compete with steel bridge systems, the design of PC I-girder Bridge system must lead to the most economical use of materials. In this study, minimum cost design approach of a post-tensioned PC I-girder is presented. The objective is to minimize the total cost in the design process of the bridge system considering the cost of materials.

50|$|The Manuel Primary was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} built around an open, vertical, tapered girder with a horizontal upper member {{and a lower}} one shaped at the front into a shallow keel.

The thick-profile wing was attached to {{the upper part of the}} girder and was straight edged with constant chord apart from the angled tips of the ailerons. Extensions of two of the forward girder cross-pieces formed a triangular structure over the wing which acted as a king post for a pair of landing wires. Flying wires from the keel and the upper member about half way to the rear of the girder carried the lifting loads on the wing. There were also bracing wires from wing to the rear of the aircraft to restrain horizontal bending of the girder. The rectangular tailplane was likewise fixed to the <b>top</b> of the <b>girder</b> and carried elevators with a cut-out in which the all-moving rectangular rudder, which extended to the lower girder, could operate.|$|R
40|$|Wide flange precast/prestressed {{concrete}} I-girders {{have been}} widely used by several State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the last two decades. These girders have many advantages over standard AASHTO I-girders. Their wide and thick bottom flange accommodates a large number of prestressing strands and their wide and thin top flange provides a shorter deck span, reduced girder weight, greater stability in construction, and adequate platform for workers. Despite these advantages, the wide and thin top flange might be disadvantageous when it comes to deck removal, as it is more susceptible to damage. Therefore {{there is a need to}} investigate the impact of deck removal methods on the performance of the supporting wide flange I-girder. In this thesis, two deck removal methods are presented: saw cutting and jack hammering. The two methods were implemented on the Camp Creek Bridge over I- 80 in Lancaster County, NE before demolition due to its functional obsolesces. Different saw cutting and jack hammering techniques were performed for deck removal between <b>girders</b> and on <b>top</b> of <b>girders.</b> Data obtained from using similar techniques on three other projects were collected and analyzed. Two girders from the Camp Creek Bridge were taken to the lab for testing in flexure after applying different levels of deck removals around shear connectors and re-decking. Test results indicated adequate performance of the new composite section even when partial deck removal around shear connectors is applied. Another investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of top flange width on the performance of bridge I-girders. Top flange was assumed to be longitudinally saw cut and its width is reduced by fifty percent. The effects on geometrical properties, flexural capacity, horizontal shear capacity, and deflection were investigated analytically and experimentally under construction loads and service loads. Investigation results indicate that in some cases top flange width does not have significant impact on the structural performance of I-girders. Adviser: George Morcou...|$|R
40|$|In this {{synthesis}} study, {{information related}} to full-depth precast deck systems has been collected and analyzed {{in order to facilitate}} implementation of full-depth precast deck systems in the state of Indiana. Nine full-depth precast deck systems were identified in the literature review. For girder bridges or similar, a full-depth precast, prestressed deck system (New England Region System) is recommended to be implemented. For bridges with decks spanning in the longitudinal direction, where no precast, prestress deck systems are available, the Exodermic™ Deck System is suggested to be implemented. This system is also an alternative to the New England Region System for implementation in girder bridges. The Effideck™ System, of proprietary nature, is recommended as an alternative for bridges with decks spanning in the longitudinal direction. None of the systems, however, has been implemented over concrete or precast girders. It is also suggested for implementation the use of 1 ¼” diameter headed studs as connectors for steel girders or beams in cases of cast-in-place decks, stay-in-place decks, or full-depth systems.

40|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the ASCE Committee on Fatigue and Fracture Reliability, 80 – 90 % of failures in steel structures are related to fatigue and fracture. Therefore, fatigue and fracture reliability is an important concern for steel bridges. In this study, the finite strip method is coupled with either the fatigue approach proposed by Wirsching, or the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approach as proposed by Harris (In: Sundararajan C, Ed. Probabilistic structural mechanics handbook [chapter 7]. New York: Chapman & Hall Ltd.; 1995. p 106 – 45.), for fatigue reliability analysis of steel highway bridges. The flat shell strips are employed to model the concrete slab and steel girders, while a connection strip is developed by means of the penalty function method in order {{to take into account the}} eccentricity of the <b>top</b> flange of <b>girder.</b> The loading effects are modeled by the fatigue truck developed by Laman and Nowak (Journal of Stuctural Engineering ASCE 1996 : 726). At each sampling point with given values of slab thickness and modulus ratio, a finite strip analysis of the bridge under fatigue truck is carried out, and the stress ranges at the fatigue-prone detail are calculated. According to these stress ranges and intended service life, the fatigue failure probability can be evaluated using the fatigue approach or the LEFM approach. After the failure probability is integrated over all sampling points, the fatigue reliability of the bridge is determined. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology...|$|R
50|$|The {{truck was}} a {{development}} of the conditions controlling {{the adoption of the}} permanent way. It consisted of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to its under side, in which was a fixed short axle for the wheels. Each truck had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being properly inclined. Between the supporting wheels were two horizontal wheels, one {{on each side of the}} upper girder, upon vertical axles attached to the frame. These wheels bear upon the rails of the upper truck beam, and were kept in yielding contact with the rails by springs outside the boxes, and served as balancing wheels to take the side oscillations of the cars. They were formed with flanges that passed under the lower edges of the rails, thus tying the truck to the rails, so that no lifting or jumping could take place, and there was no possibility of the trucks running off the track. The wheels were 42 inches in diameter, had a tread of 3½ inches, and rotated independently of each other. In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision was made to prevent the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, which would slide upon but could not leave the way. On top of the truck frame was a movable iron frame carrying four posts containing heavy spiral springs. These posts interlock with similar spring sockets bolted to the framing of the floor of the car, which was directly above the truck and within 18 inches of the <b>top</b> of the <b>girder.</b> The truck was guided in turning by a center pin, and was securely tied to the car body, as the horizontal flanges of its frame castings overlap the rim of the upper turntable. In passing curves and switches, the trucks turned upon the balancing wheels, placed centrally between the supporting wheels, which were 4 feet apart.|$|R
40|$|The railway line in Kiruna is planed to {{be moved}} before year 2012 due to {{expected}} cracking in the underlying rock. The cracking is initiated by the mining in the Kirunavaara-mine. The cracking is expected to cause increasing ground motions that affect the whole infrastructure in Kiruna. For one of the bridges, The Mine Bridge (Gruvvägsviadukten), settlements are expected in the future. Initially at its west side and further eastwards towards the city. An early assessment of the bridge showed that the bridge has enough load-carrying capacity but that {{the length of the}} reinforcement close to the interior columns probably is a little bit too short to fully compensate the prestressing force in top of the concrete girder. A certain worry has been expressed that the ground movements may cause some existing cracks to propagate upwards to the <b>girders</b> <b>top</b> i. e. that the cracks goes through the whole girder which may reduce the shear capacity remarkable. Luleå University of Technology is asked to perform a more thoroughly study of the bridge's capacity to resist different scenarios of settlements. This thesis {{is a part of the}} work and deals with non-linear finite element modelling and analysis of the bridge's capacity to resist the settlements and to evaluate limits for certain expected scenarios of settlements. To confirm the correctness of the final model, the displacements from the model is compared to measured displacement for a known truck load. The comparison shows that the model is somewhat weaker than in the reality. This is believed to depend mainly on a generalization of the deck's geometry and a stiffer construction during the field measurement. However, the model is still judge to be usable for studying what limits can be used for allowed settlements and the reason for why some cracks already exists. It is found that the most serious failure that can be expected is compression in bottom of the longitudinal girder, in middle of the considered span. This appears at a 25 mm settlement of the interior column raw in support no 2. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

[...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes.

The primary purpose of the research {{study was to examine the}} causes of the brittle fracture of the I- 64 Blue River Bridge girder. In addition to understanding the reasons for the brittle fracture, possible repair and retrofit procedures were formulated to improve the fracture resistance of bridges with details similar to the Blue River Bridge.

40|$|Assessing {{existing}} bridges is {{an important}} task in the sustainable management ofinfrastructure. In practice, structural bridge assessments are usually conducted usingtraditional and standardised methods, despite knowledge that these methods oftenprovide conservative estimates. In addition, more advanced methods are available, suchas nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis, that are used for research purposes and cansimulate the structural behaviour of bridges more accurately. Therefore, it would beuseful to develop practical and reliable procedures for refined assessments using theseadvanced techniques. Focusing on the ultimate load-carrying capacity of existing concrete bridges, this thesispresents a procedure for structural assessments. The fundamental idea is to improve theassessment successively, as necessary to predict bridges’ structural behaviour adequately. The procedure involves a multi-level assessment strategy with four levels of structuralanalysis, and an integrated framework for safety verification. At the initial level (Level 1) of the multi-level strategy, traditional standardised methods are used, no failures arecovered implicitly in the structural analysis and action effects are verified using localresistances calculated using analytical models. In the subsequent enhanced levels (Levels 2 – 4), nonlinear FE analysis is used for stepwise integration of the verification of flexural,shear-related and anchorage failures into the structural analysis. The framework for safetyverifications includes partial safety factor (PSF), global resistance safety factor (GRSF) andfull probabilistic methods. Within each of these groups, verifications of desired safetymargins can be conducted {{with varying degrees of}} complexity. To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed structural assessment procedure, comparativestudies have been carried out, based on full-scale tests of a prestressed concrete bridge. This was the Kiruna Bridge, located in the northernmost city in Sweden, which was duefor demolition as part of a city transformation project, necessitated by large grounddeformations caused by the large nearby mine. Thus, it was available for destructiveexperimental investigation within the doctoral project presented in this thesis. The bridgehad five continuous spans, was 121. 5 m long and consisted of three parallel girders with a connecting slab at the <b>top.</b> Both the <b>girders</b> and slab were tested to failure to investigatetheir structural behaviour and load-carrying capacity. Non-destructive and destructivetests were also applied to determine the residual prestress forces in the bridge girders andinvestigate the in situ applicability of methods developed for this purpose. The so-calledsaw-cut method and decompression-load method were used after refinement to enabletheir application to structures of such complexity. The variation of the experimentallydetermined residual prestress forces was remarkably high, depending on the sectioninvestigated. There were also high degrees of uncertainty in estimated values, and thusare only regarded as indications of the residual prestress force. Level 1 analysis of the multi-level assessment strategy consistently underestimatedcapacity, relative to the test results, and did not provide accurate predictions of the shearrelatedfailure observed in the test. With linear FE analysis and local resistance modelsdefined by the European standard, Eurocode 2, the load-carrying capacity wasunderestimated by 32 % for the bridge girder and 55 % for the bridge deck slab. At theenhanced level of structural analysis (Level 3), nonlinear FE analyses predicted thecapacities with less than 2 % deviation from the test results and correctly predicted thefailure mode. However, for existing bridges there are many uncertainties, for instance,the FE simulations were sensitive to the level of residual prestressing, boundaryconditions and assumed material parameters. To accurately take these aspects intoaccount, bridge-specific information is crucial. The complete structural assessment procedure, combining the multi-level strategy andsafety verification framework, was evaluated in a case study. Experiences from theprevious comparative studies were used in an assessment of the Kiruna Bridge followingthe Swedish assessment code. The initial assessment at Level 1 of the multi-level strategyand safety verification, using the PSF method, indicated that the shear capacity of one ofthe girders was critical. The most adverse load case (a combination of permanent loads,prestressing and variable traffic loads) was further investigated through enhancedstructural analyses implicitly accounting for flexural and shear-related failures (Level 3). Nonlinear FE analysis and safety evaluation using the PSF method, several variants of theGRSF method and the full probabilistic analysis for resistance indicated that the permittedaxle load for the critical classification vehicle could be 5. 6 – 6. 5 times higher than thelimit obtained from the initial assessment at Level 1. However, the study also indicatedthat the model uncertainty was not fully considered in these values. The modeluncertainty was shown to have strong effects on the safety verification and (thus) permissible axle loads. The case study also highlighted the need for a strategy forsuccessively improving structural analysis to improve understanding of bridges’ structuralbehaviour. The refined analysis indicated a complex failure mode, with yielding of thestirrups in the bridge girders and transverse flexural reinforcement in the bridge deck slab,but with a final shear failure of the slab. It would be impossible to capture suchcomplexity in a traditional standardised assessment, which (as mentioned) indicated thatthe shear capacity of the girder limited permissible axle loads. However, nonlinear FEanalyses are computationally demanding, and numerous modelling choices are required. Besides a strategy for rationally improving the analysis and helping analysts to focus oncritical aspects, detailed guidelines for nonlinear FE analysis should be applied to reduce the analyst-dependent variability of results and (thus) the model uncertainty. Clearly, toensure the validity of bridge assessment methods under in situ conditions, theirevaluations should include in situ tests. This thesis presents outcomes of such tests, therebyhighlighting important aspects for future improvements in the assessment of existingbridges...|$|R
