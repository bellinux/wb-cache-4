5|$|In all molluscs, <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers}} the animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes.

5000|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler {{can adapt}} to forest {{fragmentation}} {{better than other}} species due to its low energy lifestyle, small home ranges and ability to exploit widely available food sources. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is important to its ecosystems {{for a number of}} reasons, but especially in its capacity as a seed disperser and germinator, since passing through the monkey's digestive tract appears to aid the germination of certain seeds. [...] Dung beetles, which are also seed dispersers as well as nutrient recyclers, also appear to be dependent on the presence of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler. [...] <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is protected from international trade under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is {{native to}} Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. Within Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is found in {{locations}} throughout the countries. In Colombia and Ecuador, it is found in a narrow corridor bordered by the Pacific Ocean {{to the west and}} the Andes Mountains to the east and also in Colombia in a small area near the Caribbean Sea close to the Panama border. In Guatemala, <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is found through {{the central part of the}} country, and into southeastern Mexico south of the Yucatán Peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is among the most commonly seen and heard primates in many Central American national parks, including Manuel Antonio, Corcovado, Monteverde and Soberania. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler lives in several different types of forest, including secondary forest and semi-deciduous forest but is found in higher densities in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest. [...] <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is sympatric with another howler monkey species, the Guatemalan black howler, A. pigra, over a small part of its range, in Guatemala and Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler (Alouatta palliata aequatorialis) is a {{subspecies}} of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler, A. palliata. It {{ranges from}} Panama (or possibly the eastern tip of Costa Rica) through Colombia and Ecuador into northern Peru. [...] The range limits between <b>the</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler and <b>the</b> golden-mantled howler {{are not entirely}} clear. <b>The</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler replaces <b>the</b> Golden-mantled howler in either extreme eastern Costa Rica or western Panama. <b>The</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler differs from the golden-mantled howler primarily by being paler, with a more yellowish mantle.|$|R
5|$|Pulmonates {{are mostly}} land {{snails and slugs}} that have {{developed}} a simple lung from <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity. An externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air {{to be taken into}} <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity lung.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity.|$|E

50|$|The {{transition}} zone {{is part of}} <b>the</b> Earth’s <b>mantle,</b> and is located between <b>the</b> lower <b>mantle</b> and <b>the</b> upper <b>mantle,</b> between a depth of 410 and 660 km (250 to 400 miles). <b>The</b> Earth’s <b>mantle,</b> including <b>the</b> {{transition zone}}, consists primarily of peridotite, an ultramafic igneous rock.|$|R
40|$|The abundances of V, Cr, and Mn {{inferred}} for <b>the</b> <b>mantles</b> of <b>the</b> {{earth and}} moon decrease {{in that order}} and are similar in both mantles (but distinct from those in <b>the</b> <b>mantles</b> of <b>the</b> Eucrite Parent Body and Shergottite Parent Body), suggesting a common origin for <b>the</b> <b>mantles</b> of <b>the</b> earth and the moon. This hypothesis was investigated {{on the basis of}} a comparison between the depletions of V, Cr, and Mn in <b>the</b> <b>mantles</b> of <b>the</b> earth and the moon, and the metal/silicate partition coefficients of these elements at 1260 C and 1 bar pressure among a S-bearing metallic liquid, a silicate melt, and a FeNi alloy. It was found that the earth and the moon depletions of V, Cr, and Mn are not correlated with metal/silicate partition coefficients; the V and Cr partitioned into S-rich metallic liquids under reducing conditions more strongly than Mn, consistent with the relative volatilities of these elements. This indicates that the depletion patterns of these elements in <b>the</b> <b>mantles</b> of <b>the</b> earth and moon cannot be attributed primarily to terrestrial core formation...|$|R

5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of <b>the</b> <b>mantle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> length and are 67 to 70% of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to <b>the</b> <b>mantle.</b> A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E

50|$|The Dodinga Hills guereza hasn't been {{recorded}} since the 1960s. Unlike most other primate species, <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza can survive habitat degradation {{and can even}} thrive in degraded forests. Sometimes, logging may {{increase the number of}} preferred food trees for <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza and it is more abundant in logged areas than unlogged ones. However, complete forest clearance causes dramatic declines in numbers. In Uganda complete forest clearings caused a decline of 50% over eight years. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza is also threatened by hunting for meat and its skin. Mantled guereza meat sells as bushmeat for $4-9 US. The skins have been sold for fashion or in the tourist trade.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is <b>the</b> most folivorous {{species of}} Central American monkey. Leaves make up between almost 50% and 75% of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler's diet. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler is {{selective}} about the trees it eats from, and it prefers young leaves to mature leaves. This selectivity {{is likely to}} reduce the levels of toxins ingested, since certain leaves of various species contain toxins. Young leaves generally have less toxins {{as well as more}} nutrients than more mature leaves, and are also usually easier to digest. Mantled howler monkeys possess large salivary glands that help break down the leaf tannins by binding the polymers before the food bolus reaches the gut. Although leaves are abundant, they are a low energy food source. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler relies so heavily on a low energy food source drives much of its behaviour - for example, howling to locate other groups and spending {{a large portion of the}} day resting.|$|R
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E
5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism are broken into ammonia, which is eliminated by diffusion through <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to excrete ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have {{no sign of the}} podocytes, which perform the first phase of excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E

50|$|The golden-mantled howler (Alouatta palliata palliata) is a {{subspecies}} of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler, A. palliata. It ranges {{throughout much}} of Central America, in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and possibly Panama. The range limits between the golden-mantled howler and <b>the</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler are not entirely clear. <b>The</b> Ecuadorian <b>mantled</b> howler replaces <b>the</b> golden-mantled howler in either extreme eastern Costa Rica or western Panama.|$|R
50|$|Although leaves {{tend to make}} up the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler's diet, fruit can also make up {{a large portion of the}} diet. When available, the proportion of fruit in the diet can be as much as 50%, and can sometimes exceed the proportion of leaves. The leaves and fruit from Ficus trees tend to be the preferred source of <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> howler. Flowers can also make up a significant portion of the diet and are eaten in particularly significant quantities during the dry season. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> howler tends to get the water it needs from its food, drinking from tree holes during the wet season, and by drinking water trapped in bromeliads.|$|R
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>mantle.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mantle</b> proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantle</b> is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. <b>The</b> <b>mantle</b> was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>mantle,</b> but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, {{mantling}} is blazoned mantled x, doubled lined y; {{the cloth}} has two sides, {{one of a}} heraldic colour (the five principal colours being red, blue, green, black, or purple—there are other very rare colours as well) and the other of a heraldic metal (white or yellow). (See tincture (heraldry) for more on these tinctures.) <b>The</b> <b>mantling</b> is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the livery colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which the outside of <b>the</b> <b>mantling</b> is per pale of two colours.http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif or both the inside and outside are per pale,http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-ocsod_en.shtml and even rarer examples of other divisions, {{and there is a}} perhaps unique example in which the lining of <b>the</b> <b>mantling</b> is per pale of the two metals or of <b>the</b> entire <b>mantling</b> being of a single tincture. [...] <b>The</b> <b>mantling</b> of <b>the</b> Black Loyalist Heritage Society is a unique example in which <b>the</b> <b>mantling</b> is of two furs (ermines, lined ermine). The Coat of Arms of Canada is mantled white and red, or argent doubled gules; furthermore, the current standard rendering of the Canadian arms has <b>mantling</b> in <b>the</b> shape of maple leaves. The arms of sovereigns are a common exception. The arms of the United Kingdom and those of Emperor Akihito of Japan are both or, lined ermine, such a mantling often being held to be limited to sovereigns.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza is {{distributed}} throughout Equatorial Africa. It ranges from Nigeria and Cameroon {{in the west}} to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and northern Tanzania in <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza lives in both deciduous and evergreen forests. It mainly inhabits forest and savannah woodlands and often extend into highland and montane forests. It can be found in other forest habitats, both primary and secondary, such as riparian (near fresh or brackish water), gallery, and upland forests. It is particularly common in forests close to rivers and lakes and at high elevations. It can be found in elevations as high as 3300 m. This species prefers secondary forests and selects them over old-growth forests if given the choice. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza prefers these forests due to the increased number of food trees and the weaker chemical defenses of the species within. <b>The</b> <b>mantled</b> guereza is sometimes found in swamps as well as human-made habitats such as Eucalyptus plantations, which may be frequented when the monkey has nutritional deficiencies.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantle</b> is {{equivalent}} to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture {{is referred to as}} icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. <b>The</b> <b>mantle</b> may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.|$|E
5|$|The {{outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to {{distinguish it from}} a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{about the origin}} of Bowie seamount: Geological studies indicate that the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain may have formed above a center of upwelling magma called a mantle plume. The seamounts comprising the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain would be formed above <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> plume and carried away from <b>the</b> <b>mantle</b> plume's magmatic source as the Pacific Plate moves in a northwesterly direction towards the Aleutian Trench, along the southern coastline of Alaska.|$|E
40|$|MD {{simulations}} with pairwise potential on MgO and MgSiO vacancies pair {{were conducted}} to obtain the Newtonian viscos- 3 ity of lower <b>mantle.</b> <b>The</b> results of MgO are such that the viscosity of the upper half portion in <b>the</b> lower <b>mantle</b> shows uniform structure but in the lower half it rapidly decreases to <b>the</b> core <b>mantle</b> boundary by two order of magnitude. On the other hand, the viscosity of MgSiO perovskite decreases gradually with increasing pressure in <b>the</b> whole lower <b>mantle</b> conditions. 3 To clarify mineral controlling the rheology of <b>the</b> deep lower <b>mantle,</b> we compare <b>the</b> diffusion coefficients of slowest atoms of MgO and MgSiO in <b>the</b> lower <b>mantle</b> conditions. <b>The</b> {{results indicate that the}} viscosity of <b>the</b> whole lower <b>mantle</b> is 3 governed by lattice diffusion of MgO. Thus, <b>the</b> actual lower <b>mantle</b> rheology should also show the viscosity lowering in <b>the</b> deepest lower <b>mantle...</b>|$|R
30|$|Two M[*]~[*] 7 {{earthquakes}} in the Philippine Sea slab (red {{stars in}} Figure  7) are interpreted {{to have occurred}} {{as a result of}} right-lateral deformation along the western boundary of <b>the</b> serpentinized <b>mantle</b> (Nakajima and Hasegawa 2010).
