5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results <b>that</b> <b>shook</b> his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|The DWS has functioned {{successfully}} {{since its}} initial operation in 2007. The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung <b>that</b> <b>shook</b> southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Xinshi Tainan (台南新市) and six trains were {{stopped on the}} track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was well noted, and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global railway industry.|$|E
