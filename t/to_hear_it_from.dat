500|$|McEntire {{signed with}} MCA Nashville Records in 1984 and {{released}} her seventh studio album, Just a Little Love. Harold Shedd was originally the album's producer; however, McEntire rejected his suggestions towards country pop arrangements. It was instead produced by Norro Wilson, although the album {{still had a}} distinguishable country pop sound. Dissatisfied with the album's sound, she went to MCA president, Jimmy Bowen, who told McEntire to find material that was best-suited to her liking. Instead of finding new material, she found previously recorded country hits from her own record collection, which was then recorded for the album. The album's material included songs originally released as singles by Ray Price ("Don't You Believe Her", [...] "I Want <b>to</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>It</b> <b>from</b> You"), Carl Smith ("Before I Met You"), Faron Young ("He's Only Everything") and Connie Smith ("You've Got Me [...] ). The album spawned two number-one singles: [...] "How Blue" [...] and [...] "Somebody Should Leave". It was given positive reviews from critics, with Billboard praising McEntire as [...] "the finest woman country singer since Kitty Wells" [...] and Rolling Stone critics honoring her {{as one of their}} Top 5 favorite country artists. Upon its release, My Kind of Country became her highest-peaking album on the Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 13. The album also included instruments such as a fiddle and pedal steel guitar, and was aimed more towards a traditional country sound. McEntire was later praised as a [...] "new traditionalist", along with Ricky Skaggs, George Strait, and Randy Travis. That year, she won the Country Music Association Awards' Female Vocalist of the Year, her first major industry award. The album was certified Gold.|$|E

2500|$|The Bureau {{alleged that}} competitors' {{executives}} met in restaurants, coffee shops and at conventions, and that Nestlé Canada CEO, Robert Leonidas once handed a competitor an envelope containing his company’s pricing information, saying: [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the top– I take my pricing seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But, Fanny," [...] he {{presently}} added, [...] "in {{order to}} have a comfortable walk, something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what you are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>it</b> <b>from</b> everybody but Fanny herself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I {{was waiting}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more of <b>it</b> <b>from</b> you. Tell me {{how in the}} world you're so certain about the {{fittings}} of the ship. You know nothing of ships." ...|$|R

50|$|Catherine's death after {{childbirth}} causes Nelly {{to nurse}} another child, Catherine Linton. Nelly tenderly adores Cathy, and, fearing for her future, she and Edgar try desperately {{to keep the}} innocent yet curious girl from falling into Heathcliff's machinations. Heathcliff succeeds in spite of them, and Cathy is forced into a marriage with his weak and quickly-dying son Linton. Cathy's misery at Wuthering Heights {{is one of the}} few sequences of events that Nelly does not witness for herself: She has been ordered by Heathcliff to remain at the Grange, but inveterate gossip that she is, she manages <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Zillah, the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} she is well, {{although}} of course she must have suffered very greatly at your disappearance. I haven't the pleasure of knowing her personally, but several friends of mine are acquainted with her. I heard the matter talked about {{at the time the}} boat was missing. Some portions of her were picked up by other fishing boats, and by the shattered state of some of the planks they said that she had been run down; beside, there had been no wind about the time she disappeared, so that there was little doubt some vessel or other had cut her down. I happened <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Colonel Bryant, who is a friend of your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that Sir Patrick has guessed wrong," [...] she resumed. [...] "My friend {{was anxious to}} recover the letter when I last saw her; and I hoped <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> news of <b>it</b> <b>from</b> you. However, right or wrong, Sir Patrick has some reasons for wishing to see you--and I take the {{opportunity}} of telling you so. He has left a letter to wait for you at the Craig Fernie inn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said, [...] "but I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> your sister. It is {{her duty}} to tell me, and I {{would not have}} her think that I {{had been trying to}} work upon your sympathies to learn her secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] {{she said}} suddenly, {{withdrawing}} her veil and lifting her clear eyes to his in the moonlight. [...] "You must not say THAT--it isn't the truth. I can't bear <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> YOUR lips, in YOUR voice. My name is NOT Rivers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to hear of it," [...] he said, leaping to his feet. [...] "If there was {{anything}} my father wanted me to know he would tell it to me at once. You do not suppose I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> anyone else?" ...|$|E
50|$|Circa 2000, London Weekend Television made a British {{version of}} Grudge Match (which {{did not have}} the word the in its title), hosted by Nick Weir and Lisa Rogers, and {{featured}} former boxing champion Barry McGuigan as the referee. Instead of the typical challenges as seen on the US version, the challenges were more made in the style of Gladiators, the show which Grudge Match replaced. The winner got a bonus prize, as in the US version, but the loser had to pay a forfeit. The prizes and forfeits were based on the storylines of the grudge. Occasionally Lisa would talk to audience members who were relatives and/or friends of the contenders prior <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> about <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the contenders' perspectives. This show also ran just one series on weekends on ITV prime time.|$|R
60|$|In one of {{the old-fashioned}} books for {{children}} {{there was a story}} of the adventures of a cent (or perhaps that coin of older lineage, a penny) told by itself, which came into my mind when the publishers suggested that the readers of a new edition of this book might like to know how it happened to be written. I promptly fancied the book speaking, and taking upon itself the burden of autobiography, which we none of us find very heavy; and no sooner had I done so than I began actually <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> in a narrative of much greater distinctness than I could have supplied for it.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{was used}} as the soundtrack in both the 90-second long trailer and as the theme tune to Channel 4's {{coverage}} of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The song subsequently experienced a surge in sales, peaking at number 4 - becoming Public Enemy's first Top 10 single in the UK and their highest-charting single ever in the nation. A review for The Independent said of its re-release in the UK: [...] "Following its prominent use in Channel 4's Paralympics coverage, great lost 2007 single 'Harder Than You Think' had a sales surge that carried it into the UK Top Five, giving the band their biggest hit to date. It'd be a thrilling piece of work in any era, Chuck delivering a typically apocalyptic call to arms over a backing track which uses a horn sample from Shirley Bassey's 'Jezahel', but <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> blasting <b>from</b> the radio in the second decade of this century is beyond beautiful." [...] The song also serves as the theme tune to the British TV show The Last Leg, which was originally a show that ran alongside the 2012 Paralympics, but later spun off as an independent show.|$|R
6000|$|Con. Oh, Ione, {{could she}} send none but thee {{to tell me}} this? <b>To</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> thy lips but makes the tidings heavier to bear. Canst thou bid me go, and vow to love one whom I have learned to hate? Canst thou bid me leave thee for a fate like this? ...|$|E
60|$|And it gratified her <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> him. Other {{people had}} such a passion to make {{everything}} of one degree, of one pattern. In England it was chic to be perfectly ordinary. And {{it was a relief}} to her to be acknowledged extraordinary. Then she need not fret about the common standards.|$|E
6000|$|Alethea was {{a little}} hurt by her coldness, but she {{ascribed}} it to dejection and embarrassment, and blamed herself for hurrying on {{what she had to}} tell without sufficient regard for Lily's distress. There was an awkward pause, which Alethea broke, by saying, 'Your brother thought you would like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see you understand, {{since you}} make the {{answering}} signal," [...] said he. [...] "And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty. But do you know, Mr. David, this {{seems to me a}} very enterprising lass? She crops up from every side. The Government of Scotland appears unable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat the case (no great while back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour. Should not these make a good match? Her first intromission in politics--but I must not tell you that story, the authorities have decided you are <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> otherwise and <b>from</b> a livelier narrator. This new example is more serious, however; and I am afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in prison." ...|$|R
50|$|John Paul {{eventually}} tells Craig {{to leave}} Sarah, {{and in turn}} he promises to leave Spike. Whilst John Paul and Spike break up, Craig and Sarah do not, leaving John Paul furious and frustrated. Craig then arranges a last minute get-away for Sarah, without telling John Paul. Angry and upset, John Paul writes a letter to Frankie Osborne saying {{that he has been}} sleeping with her son and that he is sorry that she had <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about <b>it</b> <b>from</b> him. Later, once he has calmed down and realises his mistake, he manages to retrieve it with Spike's help. Despite no longer being a couple, Spike still offers John Paul something more casual, but he quickly realises he no longer has romantic feelings for Spike (despite Craig's betrayal) and tells him it is over for good. When Craig returns from his holiday, and tells John Paul that he still has feelings for him, John Paul snaps back that he has had enough and intends to end it with Craig for good. Despite this, they soon get back together again and the relationship continues in secret.|$|R
40|$|The Price of Eternal Vigilance: Women and Intoxication by Michelle McClellan. The author {{argues that}} the “cultural meaning of {{intoxication}} is shaped profoundly by the reality that we seem <b>to</b> only <b>hear</b> about <b>it</b> <b>from</b> women who have given it up. ” This is a problem when it obscures the reasons why women seek out alcohol. Resisting the seemingly inevitable trajectory of addiction and recovery narratives, McClellan introduces the concepts of “dry” and “wet” feminism {{to draw attention to}} both the cultural expectations women face and the ways that intoxication might serve as a form of resistance. By refusing to see intoxication as a sort of false consciousness from which women must awake, McClellan demonstrates that it reflects female ambivalence about mothering, sexuality, and pleasure itself. ...|$|R
