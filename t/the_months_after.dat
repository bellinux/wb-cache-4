5|$|The {{facilities}} on Morotai {{continued to}} be heavily used by the Allies in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the war. The Australian force responsible for the occupation and military administration of the eastern NEI was headquartered at Morotai until April 1946, when the Dutch colonial government was reestablished. The island {{was also one of}} the sites where the Australian and NEI militaries conducted war crimes trials of Japanese personnel.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Mozambique, {{estimated at}} about $20million (1994USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% {{of the houses}} were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300deaths in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi.|$|E

Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the floods, the {{government}} of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging. The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long term solutions. Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding. The project was completed in December 2001 {{at a cost of}} US$31.59million; the International Development Association paid US$27.44million, and Yemen's government provided the rest of the funding.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm. There were 8,000people {{listed as}} missing about {{ten days after}} Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with record-keeping {{made it difficult to}} determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro Department had 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cortés departments.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm's passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after World War I, Britain {{expanded}} Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore's north coast {{as part of}} plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the Singapore strategy). The resulting facility {{was among the most}} important in the British Empire and included the large King GeorgeVI graving dock and AdmiraltyIX floating dry dock. The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the outbreak of the Pacific War, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft {{on a number of occasions}} during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent fighting on the island itself; these raids caused many civilian deaths.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the war, Australian {{authorities}} {{were responsible for}} administering all of Borneo and the NEI east of Lombok until the British and Dutch colonial governments were re-established. While British and Indian forces in {{the west of the}} NEI became caught up in the Indonesian National Revolution, the Australians were able to avoid clashes with local nationalists. Australian forces were also responsible for guarding the 344,000 remaining Japanese in the NEI and Australian territories and administering war crimes trials in these areas. A volunteer force was formed as Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan, and Australia provided the BCOF's headquarters and a high proportion of its personnel. This force later formed the nucleus of the post-war Australian Army, which included permanent combat units for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
5|$|Royal Sovereign {{was laid}} down on 15 January 1914 at the HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. The ship was {{launched}} on 29 April 1915 and commissioned in May 1916. On 30 May 1916, {{three weeks after}} her commissioning, Royal Sovereign was present in Scapa Flow when the fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to sea. Jellicoe purposely left Royal Sovereign behind in port due to the inexperience of her crew; causing her to miss the Battle of Jutland the following day. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the engagement, Royal Sovereign was quickly made ready for service with the fleet to further increase the numerical superiority of the Grand Fleet over the German High Seas Fleet.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{received}} a tepid response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the work stoppage. Quickly ratified by the owners and players, the deal was signed later in January, ending the lockout after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the lockout, television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the Grey Cup. By {{the time}} of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport {{as a replacement for}} the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{amendment}} to the Tripartite Pact was not yet in force, Hitler chose to declare war on the United States and ordered the Reichstag, along with Italy, to do so on 11 December 1941, {{three days after the}} United States' declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. His hopes that, despite the previous rejections, Japan would reciprocally attack the Soviet Union, were not realized, as Japan stuck to its Nanshin strategy of going south, not north, and would continue to maintain an uneasy peace with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Germany's declaration of war further solidified German–Japanese relations and showed Germany's solidarity with Japan, which was now encouraged to cooperate against the British. To some degree, Japan's actions in South-East Asia and the Pacific in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> Pearl Harbor, including the sinking of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse, the occupation of the Crown Colonies of Singapore, Hong Kong, and British Burma, and the air raids on Australia, were a tremendous blow to the United Kingdom's war effort and preoccupied the Allies, shifting British (including Australian) and American assets away from the Battle of the Atlantic and the North African Campaign against Germany to Asia and the Pacific against Japan. In this context, sizeable forces of the British Empire were withdrawn from North Africa to the Pacific theatre with their replacements being only relatively inexperienced and thinly spread divisions. Taking advantage of this situation, Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps successfully attacked only six weeks after Pearl Harbor, eventually pushing the allied lines as far east as El Alamein.|$|E

5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, {{which was to be}} harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{seems to}} have moved around Greece in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and {{installing}} garrisons; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, {{that they should not}} try to oppose him. In mid 337 BC, he {{seems to have}} camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed {{in the latter half of}} 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta. The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'. At Philip's behest, the synod of the league then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign.|$|E
