25|$|In October 2002, a {{few days}} before the US Senate vote on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, about 75 {{senators}} were told in closed session that the Iraqi government had the means of delivering biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the US' Atlantic coast <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>US</b> eastern seaboard cities. Colin Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the United States.|$|E

25|$|Illustrating the {{difficulties}} German forces faced in getting their armor to the front, it took ten days {{to bring the}} first five Jagdtigers of the 2nd company 512th Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion to the front due to communications breakdowns and the threat from fighter-bombers. The 1st Company lost four Jagdtigers in rearguard actions, three due to mechanical breakdowns. When they finally engaged the American armor around Herborn, Jagdtigers began <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> tanks at long range and claimed it destroyed 30 U.S. tanks, but no strategic victory was gained.|$|E
25|$|The squad {{moves to}} London {{to track down}} Ali Hassan Salameh, who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the {{assassination}} attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh {{in exchange for his}} promise not <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death on a park bench, while Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.|$|E
25|$|The LoADS {{concept was}} {{one of a number of}} {{proposals}} that were made as part of a larger and acrimonious debate over the best way to base the MX missile. It was believed that by about 1980 Soviet ICBMs would improve to the point where it was possible <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>US</b> ICBMs while they were still in their silos. A number of warfighting scenarios suggested that a surprise attack would significantly reduce the US stockpile and greatly blunt any counterattack. In the case of the MX, a single successful strike on a silo would mean ten warheads would not reach the USSR, making these extremely valuable targets. To ensure such an attack would fail, at least to the point where the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) would be maintained, a wide variety of basing options were considered that would guarantee the survival of at least dozens of MX's.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, North Korea {{announced}} that it was scrapping all non-aggression pacts with South Korea, along with other escalations such as closing the border and closing the direct phone line between the two Koreas. North Korea stated it had the right to make a preemptive nuclear attack. A United Nations spokesman stated the armistice agreement had been adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, and could not be unilaterally dissolved by either North Korea or South Korea. On March 28, 2013, the U.S. sent two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers to South Korea to participate in ongoing military exercises in the region, including the dropping of inert munitions on a South Korean bomb range. This was the first B-2 non stop, round-trip mission to Korea from the United States. Following this mission, North Korean state media {{announced that}} it was readying rockets to be on standby <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> targets. In May 2013, North Korea offered to enter into negotiations for a peace treaty to replace the armistice agreement.|$|E
25|$|Norton's first {{assignment}} out of West Point was to 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division as {{a company}} commander. He then returned to Infantry School {{in the fall of}} 1942 to attend the Battalion Commander and Staff Officers Course and the Parachute Course. Following his completion of the course, he reported to the 82nd Airborne Division in North Africa in 1943; he would participate in all four of its combat jumps in World War II. He was soon promoted to executive officer of the 2d Battalion. Two months later, he was again promoted, to S3 of the Regiment. He made his first of four combat jumps as an executive officer, participating in the Invasion of Sicily. After returning to North Africa, he made a second combat jump into Salerno, Italy, blocking German forces who were trying <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>US</b> amphibious forces. His third jump was in support of the Invasion of Normandy on D-Day, June 4, 1944. In July of that year, he assumed command of the 3d Battalion; he was promoted the next month to G3 of the 82d Airborne Division. Norton made his fourth combat jump in September, in the Netherlands {{to take control of the}} bridges from the Dutch border to Arnhem.|$|E

500|$|David Scheffer, {{director}} of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> defense installations was a complicating factor. [...] "Normally when an individual is under indictment {{the purpose is to}} capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him... The object is not to literally summarily execute him if he's under indictment." [...] Scheffer and another expert stated {{that it was important to}} determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him. If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden without trying first to capture him, it [...] "may have violated American ideals if not international law." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States had grievances at British {{violations}} of American sovereignty (their navy was impressing US sailors), restriction of American trade by Britain, and an American desire to gain territory by invading and annexing the poorly defended British North American colonies. American grievances included the impressment of American sailors by the Royal Navy, the blockade of French ports, {{and a belief}} that the British were inciting American Indians <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> settlements on the western frontier. War hawks in the U.S. called for an invasion of Canada to punish the British Empire and to lessen the threat to American interests represented by the Native Americans. At the same time, the US leaders believed that the growing population needed new territory; some imagined that the United States was destined to control all of the North American continent. (This philosophy was later known as Manifest Destiny.) American hawks assumed that Canadian colonists would rise up and support the invading U.S. armies as liberators and that, as Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, conquering Canada would be [...] "a mere matter of marching".|$|E
500|$|A {{small company}} of Hessian dragoons led by Captain Johann Ewald {{headed up the}} road from the tavern toward Cooch's Bridge as Cornwallis's advance guard. [...] These were struck by a volley of fire from an American ambush and many of them fell, either killed or wounded. [...] Ewald {{remained}} unwounded, and quickly alerted the Hessian and Ansbach Jäger, who rushed forward to meet the Americans. [...] This began a running skirmish that Major John André described as follows: [...] "Here the rebels began <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>us</b> about 9o'clock with a continued irregular fire for nearly two miles." [...] Howe rode to the front lines, and seeing Iron Hill crawling with enemy soldiers, ordered his troops to clear it. At this time, much of Maxwell's force was defending Iron Hill, while the rest were protecting Cooch's Bridge. The Jäger, numbering over 400men led by Lieutenant Colonel Ludwig von Wurmb, formed a line and, with the support of some artillery, advanced on the Americans. [...] Von Wurmb sent one detachment to Maxwell's left, hoping to flank his position, and supported the move with a bayonet charge against the American center.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a matter}} of law, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden {{was the leader of}} a {{criminal}} organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also known as the RICO statutes.

Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>U.S.</b> military establishments.
