His foster parents were aware of <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto on his bike and sexually assaulting children.|$|E

There are no winds, changes of states of weather or the blue sky in the Realm of Light, because the sun can't shine there. The technology of the Realm of Light is very progressive for the sake of high education of the Strangers.

He notes that the development of a [...] "collective prejudice" [...] against a foreign entity provides meaning for the group by conjuring up an opposite who commit social taboos. He also suggests that one society's belief that a foreign society is cannibalistic might arise from an inability to differentiate between the latter's conceptions of the natural and the supernatural. As evidence, he asserts that rumors that the Indigenous Americans of Northeastern Canada were cannibals arose when foreign societies learned of their folkloric beliefs in man-eating giants who lived in the wilderness and conflated <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> with reality.|$|E
500|$|In an Astaire-Rogers picture, the Big White Set — {{as these}} Art Deco-inspired creations were known — {{took up the}} largest share of the film's {{production}} costs, and Top Hat was no exception.

500|$|Several critics {{found the}} lack of an {{anthropomorphic}} point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has [...] "no real context ... no rationale for probing <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> other than [...] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: [...] "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the [...] "book [...] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".|$|E

[...] Readers have also praised the novel; Jane LeGak, an Amazon Reviewer, stated that, [...] "Rats and other wonderfully creepy creatures fill the story's dark underworld, but what makes this book so wonderful is how human it is."

500|$|Kubicek {{characterized}} {{the fact that}} Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as [...] "an absurd plot twist". He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote, [...] "Santana's plan isn't vicious or mean, it's getting justice. Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it." [...] Slezak thought the {{decision as to whether}} the police would be given Santana's evidence should have been Blaine's to make, and Lynch posited that [...] "a talk with the police" [...] might teach Sebastian [...] "that violent actions have legal consequences". Chaney was incredulous at Will's statements to the glee club on the matter, especially, [...] "Unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushie, the police aren’t getting involved." [...] Kubicek called Artie's anger that led to [...] "Scream" [...] a story arc that [...] "goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song", but Votta was impressed that [...] "we learn more about Artie's frustration in <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> scene than we have in 3 seasons".

[...] In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy {{comparable to that of}} Disney Princesses, and that <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that [...] "it is the entire genre that is problematic." ...|$|E

Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film.

Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear in talking to her about all <b>this</b> <b>fantasy</b> that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence.
