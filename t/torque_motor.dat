40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} an {{innovative}} drive concept for robots {{to improve their}} machining capability is presented. As a test bed a two-axis robot is designed and equipped with <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> with load-sided high resolution encoders in addition to conventional gear motors with harmonic drive gearboxes. The gear motors are used for positioning tasks while the <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> in particular compensate static and dynamic load-sided angle errors. The model-based control algorithm is decoupled and separately actuates both the servo gear and <b>torque</b> <b>motors.</b> It is shown that a considerable increase of performance is possible when adding the <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> especially regarding the compensation of dynamic angle errors. The paper will present the design and details of the new drive concept, the modeling basics and first simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{considers}} {{servo valve}} <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> having four air-gaps. An ideal for {{these types of}} <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> is to have four equal air-gaps at free state. However, real servo valve <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> have unequal air-gaps due to production errors. Because {{the influence of the}} inequality of air-gaps is not clear, servo valve manufacturers have made great efforts to establish the equality of the air-gaps. The current paper gives a prospect on how an imbalance of air-gaps changes the flux densities in the air-gaps and the resultant torque characteristic. An important result of the paper {{is that some of the}} air-gap imbalance induces a torque change of magnitude of second- or higher-powers of the imbalance. The imbalance of the air-gaps due to different pole heights results in an offset proportional to the magnitude of the imbalance. These results can be used for setting a tolerance limit for air-gap thickness...|$|R
