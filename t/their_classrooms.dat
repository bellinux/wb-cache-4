It {{was accompanied by}} a graphic novel and animated film, aired on CBC Television. All proceeds go to the University of Manitoba's Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie's brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers who had used the material in <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> and hoped to continue this.|$|E
5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} enrollment, several {{teachers}} have had <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> segregated from their main department. In recent years, the teachers were left without classrooms and had {{to make use of}} whatever rooms were available during a particular module. As a result, the building is now much less departmentalized than was originally planned.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to search for {{relationships}} of certain personal characteristics (authoritarianism, philosophy of social education, and instructional preferences) of a representative group of social studies student teachers to measures respectively of a) <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> behavioral traits, b) <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching activities, and c) <b>their</b> pupils' <b>classroom</b> behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} an action research plan for teachers to improve student outcomes by assessing, describing, and changing <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> environments. This study relied on student perceptions, using survey responses, to assess and describe the classroom environment. Teachers used this information to develop intervention strategies designed to change the students' perceptions of <b>their</b> actual <b>classroom</b> environment to more closely mirror <b>their</b> preferred <b>classroom</b> environment perceptions. More than forty years of classroom environment research has proven the importance of the classroom environment in developing positive student outcomes. Additional research has established the reliability of student perceptions of their learning environment. Previous research has developed several dependable student survey instruments to measure student perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> environment. This study was conducted in a Title I elementary school in the United States over a seven month period. Two intermediate level mathematics teachers participated in the project. Both quantitative data, using the My Classroom Inventory (MCI) and the School Level Environment Questionnaire (SLEQ), and qualitative data, teachers' case studies, were collected and analyzed. The study established that an action research plan for teachers to assess, describe, and change <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> environments could be developed. However, even though teachers realized the benefits, for their students and themselves, in changing <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> environments, school level environment demands negatively influenced their willingness to implement changes to <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> environments...|$|R
25|$|Standardized {{tests have}} caused the quality and depth of the {{educational}} curriculum to diminish (Rooks, Noliwe, and Noliwe Rooks). Instead of teachers developing a curriculum that addresses {{the needs of the}} actual students in <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> they end up using the required material which they did not take any part in creating. The required material often contains pacing guidelines which regulate when substance should be taught and scripted lessons which often limits the teacher’s abilities to make relevant decisions in a classroom.|$|E
25|$|The {{air force}} {{concluded}} in 1948 {{that it needed}} to upgrade eight of the rudimentary bases which they had abandoned {{after the end of}} the war, including Lista. This was part of a strategy to spread out the squadrons in more locations. In particular, Lista was selected as a suitable site for parts of the air force's schools. This consisted of a shooting- and bombing school and a weapon-technical school. The latter opened in 1948 and the former the following year. They used existing German barracks for their quarters and two hangars for <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{students}} {{fled the}} cafeteria {{immediately after the}} shooting started. Several climbed over the fence of a house next {{to the school and}} sought shelter there. Other students disregarded the school lockdown rules and fled <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> while they were in place. As the school was cleared by local law enforcement officials, students were taken by bus to a nearby church. It took two hours for officers to evacuate hundreds of students who were still hiding inside the school, and more than 100 witnesses were interviewed by investigators.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{reported}} in this paper was to develop substantive theory regarding how teachers manage <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> work when they are placed {{in the position of}} having a student with a severe or profound intellectual disability included in their class. The result was the theory of selective adaptation. The theory proposes that teachers can be classi"ed as &technicians', &strategists',or&improvisers' according {{to the extent to which}} they selectively adapt <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> practices. Furthermore, there is a correspondence between the extent to which teachers selectively adapt <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> work and the impact of inclusion on their lives. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|High school {{students}} in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots in <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> {{as part of a}} student vote. While their numbers did not count in the official election, they did tell a story all on their own. The student vote reflected change a lot more than the actual result, as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E

Both the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the United Federation of College Teachers (UFCT) claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to Thomism and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication.

At one point, he encountered {{the mother of a}} student as she was entering the school, but spared her. He then attempted to enter a classroom, shooting three times through the barricaded door and hitting a student in the toe. Auvinen then traveled to the school's second floor and found two students sitting on a bench in the corridor. While one student escaped him uninjured, the other was shot and killed.|$|E

25|$|Kugler led {{a strike}} at St. John's University in 1966, {{which led to}} the {{establishment}} of the AFT as a leader in the unionization of faculty and staff in higher education. In the fall of 1965, 31 faculty members at St. John's University were dismissed without due process or any hearing. Both the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the UFCT claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to Thomism and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication. The Rev. Joseph T. Cahill, president of St. John's, said the teachers had used <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> for propaganda purposes. Kugler pushed for a more radical response to the dispute, calling for a strike to begin in January 1966 and widening the dispute to include pay and benefits (faculty pay was the lowest of the ten largest Catholic universities in the U.S.) The strike at St. John's began on January 4, 1966. The union pushed for mediation and arbitration in December 1965, but the university refused to submit to either. Using tactics pioneered by Albert Shanker to win collective bargaining rights for New York City public school teachers, Kugler pushed for local and state government officials {{to get involved in the}} dispute. Only a minority of St. John's faculty walked out, forcing the university to close some but not a majority of classes. During the next two years, Kugler challenged the university's accreditation before the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools twice. But that body only warned the university and took no further action. The union raised $250,000 from the Workmen's Circle and other organizations to support the striking faculty. Kugler took professors' case to the Vatican and sought an individual audience with Pope Paul VI, whose encyclicals on workers' rights were repeatedly cited by the union. But the pope refused him an audience. In the early spring of 1967, as the strike threatened to widen to other Catholic universities in the country and state legislators opened hearings on the labor dispute, the university agreed to arbitration. The strike ended in June 1967. The union did not win recognition at St. John's, and in 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.|$|E
