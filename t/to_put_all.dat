5|$|The two layout forms {{originate}} from two graphic forms of {{presentation of the}} same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> 15 lanthanide and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (rightmost) lanthanide and actinide are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

25|$|CBA usually tries <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> {{relevant}} {{costs and benefits}} on a common temporal footing using time value of money calculations. This is often done by converting the future expected streams of costs and benefits into a present value amount using a discount rate. Empirical studies and a technical framework suggest that in reality, people do discount the future like this.|$|E
25|$|Another ancient flood myth is the Hindu {{story of}} Matsya the fish. According to this story, the god Vishnu {{takes the form}} of a fish and warns the {{ancestor}} Manu about a coming flood. He tells Manu <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> the creatures of the earth into a boat. Unlike the Biblical and Mesopotamian floods, however, this flood is not a unique event brought on by a divine choice; instead, it's one of the destructions and recreations of the universe that happen at regular intervals in Hindu mythology.|$|E

That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E

25|$|In July 1854 Liszt {{stated in}} his essay about Berlioz and Harold in Italy that not all music was {{programme}} music. If, {{in the heat of}} a debate, a person would {{go so far as to}} claim the contrary, it would be better <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> ideas of programme music aside. But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others to let a musical motif endure a fate. In any case, a programme should be added to a piece of music only if it was necessarily needed for an adequate understanding of that piece.|$|E
25|$|Most of her {{missions}} {{consisted of}} training evolutions and exercises, {{but once she}} had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> that practice to use. Late in October 1956, Israel, Britain, and France retaliated against Egypt after the latter country had seized the Suez Canal. In response to the crisis, Alameda County moved to Suda Bay, Crete, and had an emergency air base in operation by 22 November. From then until 4 December, she staged United Nations forces into the troubled area while evacuating Americans and other foreign nationals. Soon thereafter, she resumed normal operations out of Naples.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest of}} eight children, Laine {{grew up in}} the Old Town {{neighborhood}} (first at 1446 N. North Park Avenue and later at 331 W. Schiller Street) and got his first taste of singing {{as a member of the}} choir in the Church of the Immaculate Conception's elementary school across the street from the North Park Avenue home. He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson's current talking picture, The Singing Fool. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> the other singers out of business.|$|E

25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure of}} the {{performance}} of the Dutch economy during the 18th century is the estimate that De Vries and Van der Woude have made of the per capita GDP of the Dutch economy in 1742 (for which year tax records provide a basis for estimation and extrapolation). They arrive at an estimated GNP of between 265 and 280 million guilders, or 135–142 guilders per capita. This {{was at the end of}} a long period of secular decline after the economic zenith of 1650. The next decades saw some economic resurgence. In the decade 1800–1810 (again a period of economic decline) the national income of the (slightly contracted) population can be estimated at 307 million guilders, or 162 guilders per capita. <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> of this in perspective: in 1740 the GNP of Great Britain was about £80 million, or 120 guilders per capita (and therefore about 20 percent lower than the Dutch per capita income). After this the British per capita income started on a rapid increase, due to the Industrial Revolution. It therefore eventually overtook the Dutch per capita income, but probably only around 1800.|$|E
25|$|At about 00:00 on 17 April 1961, the two CIA LCIs Blagar and Barbara J, {{each with}} a CIA 'operations officer' and an Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) of five frogmen, entered the Bay of Pigs (Bahía de Cochinos) on the {{southern}} coast of Cuba. They headed a force of four transport ships (Houston, Río Escondido, Caribe and Atlántico) carrying about 1,400 Cuban exile ground troops of Brigade 2506, plus tanks and other vehicles in the landing craft. At about 01:00, Blagar, as the battlefield command ship, directed the principal landing at Playa Girón (code-named Blue Beach), led by the frogmen in rubber boats followed by troops from Caribe in small aluminium boats, then LCVPs and LCUs. Barbara J, leading Houston, similarly landed troops 35km further northwest at Playa Larga (code-named Red Beach), using small fiberglass boats. Unloading troops at night was delayed, due to engine failures and boats damaged by unforeseen coral reefs. As the frogmen came in, they were shocked {{to discover that the}} Red Beach was lit with floodlights, which led to the location of the landing being hastily changed. As the frogmen landed, a firefight broke out when a jeep carrying Cuban militia happened by. The few militia in the area succeeded in warning Cuban armed forces via radio soon after the first landing, before the invaders overcame their token resistance. Castro was woken up at about 3:15 am to be informed of the landings, which led him <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> militia units in the area on the highest state of alert and to order airstrikes. The Cuban regime planned to strike the brigadistas at Playa Larga first as they were inland before turning on the brigadistas at Girón at the sea. El Comandante departed personally to lead his forces into battle against the brigadistas.|$|E
