Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E

Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men {{in all parts of}} the UK.|$|E

[...] Because of this assumption, the majority of the studio's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas because The Lion King was deemed a [...] "risk", while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King.

500|$|The three {{remaining}} clubs (Belfast Giants, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers) began {{considering the}} formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to British players to attract other clubs into joining them. In the weeks that followed they were joined by Basingstoke Bison, Cardiff Devils, and Coventry Blaze of the British National League and two new organisations from London and Manchester. A team based in Glasgow was also planned, but did not come to fruition. The new league met considerable opposition from the British National League and the governing body Ice Hockey UK. IHUK wished the remaining Superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the BNL and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation. The Superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly British trained league after several years of playing in an import-dominated league where British players were seldom able <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the standard of their North American and European counterparts.

500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator.

2500|$|Ousby {{argued that}} given the {{widespread}} belief that the Jews in France were mostly illegal immigrants from Eastern Europe who ought to {{be sent back to}} where they came from, it was remarkable that so many ordinary people were prepared <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> attempt to save the Jews from the genocide waged by the German state assisted by Vichy France. Perhaps the most remarkable example of ordinary French people coming together to save Jews threatened with extermination was the effort of the Calvinist couple André and Magda Trocmé who brought together an entire commune Le Chambon-sur-Lignon to save between 800-1,000 Jews. Ousby further noted that the Jews in France, whether they were Israélites or immigrant or refugee Juifs, had begun the Occupation as discouraged and isolated, cut off and forced to become more and more [...] "absent from the places they lived in. Now, as the threat of absence become brutally literal, their choices were more sharply defined, more urgent even than for other people in France".
