5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth,</b> which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E

2500|$|World of Darkness {{opened in}} 1969 {{and was the}} world's first major exhibit {{designed}} specifically around nocturnal animals. Built by Morris Ketchum, Jr. & Associates, the house was built where the zoo's [...] "Rocking Stone Restaurant" [...] stood until 1942. The exhibit used red-lights to dimly illuminate the enclosures within the windowless building. Like all nocturnal exhibits, the house ran on a reversed lighting schedule, which simulated night and day at opposite times to allow visitors to view nocturnal animals in a more naturalistic setting. Due to budget cuts and the high-cost of running the exhibit, it was closed in 2009 At the time of closing, exhibited species included Rodrigues flying fox, western bay duiker, Javan slow loris, pygmy slow loris, Chinese leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis), Arabian sand cat, naked mole-rat, Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth,</b> broad-snouted caiman, and cane toad.|$|E

2500|$|Sloths are {{classified}} as folivores, as {{the bulk of their}} diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> has recently been documented eating human faeces from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths have the unique ability to protrude their tongues from their mouths , an ability that is useful for collecting leaves just out of reach. [...] As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.|$|E

25|$|However, their adaptations {{contradict}} the actual {{relationship of the}} two families, which are more distant from each other than their outward similarity suggests. The common ancestor of the two families lived around 35 Mya, making the living forms exceptional examples of convergent or parallel evolution. The modern <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are far {{more closely related to}} the Megalonychidae ground sloths than to the living three-toed sloths. Whether the ground-dwelling Megalonychidae descended from tree-climbing ancestors or whether the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are really miniature ground sloths that have converted or reverted to arboreal life cannot be properly determined yet. The latter possibility seems slightly more likely, because the small ground sloths Acratocnus and Neocnus, which were also able to climb, are among the closer relatives of the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths,</b> and these together were related to the huge ground sloths Megalonyx and Megalocnus.|$|R
50|$|Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is, however, {{much easier}} to confuse with the related Linnaeus's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth,</b> which it closely resembles. The primary {{physical}} {{differences between the two}} species relate to subtle skeletal features; for example, Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> has three foramina in the upper forward part of the interpterygoid space, rather than just two, and often - but not always - has fewer cervical vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|Modern sloths {{are divided}} into two {{families}} {{based on the number}} of toes on their front feet, Megalonychidae and Bradypodidae.

50|$|<b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> {{spend most}} of their lives hanging upside down from trees. They cannot walk, so they pull hand-over-hand to move around, which is at an {{extremely}} slow rate. Being predominantly nocturnal, their fur, which grows greenish algae to blend in, is their main source of protection. Their body temperatures depend at least partially on the ambient temperature; they cannot shiver to keep warm, as other mammals do, because of their unusually low metabolic rates and reduced musculature. <b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> also differ from three-toed sloths in their climbing behavior, preferring to descend head first.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> have a reduced, ever growing dentition, with no incisors or true canines, which overall lacks {{homology}} {{with the}} dental formula of other mammals.
