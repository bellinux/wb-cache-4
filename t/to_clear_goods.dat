50|$|The seller {{delivers}} {{when the}} goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This {{means that the}} buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the <b>goods</b> for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the <b>goods</b> for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.|$|R

5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> through customs.|$|E
40|$|How {{corruption}} affects firm-level {{trade costs}} remains an important though relatively unexplored {{line of inquiry}} in the trade literature. Corruption can increase trade costs if it represents an additional tax firms have to pay <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> across borders, or it can decrease trade costs if it allows firms to circumvent cumbersome bureaucratic procedures or reduce clearing times.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that firms can reduce fixed trade costs by hiring {{intermediaries}} like trading companies. I argue that customs brokers – a type of intermediary rarely studied in economics before – can play a similar role. Using panel data of Norwegian trade transactions, I show that such brokers are commonly used <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> through customs. I find indications of lower sunk costs as well as fixed trade costs for firms that hire such services. However, engaging brokers can be risky, and traders in high-risk products like food {{are more likely to}} self-declare.

40|$|Pakistan, {{this paper}} investigates the {{relationship}} between investment climate and firm performance. These standardized surveys of large, random samples of firms in common sectors reveal that objective measures of the investment climate vary significantly across countries and across locations within these countries. The authors focus primarily on measures of the time or monetary cost of different bottlenecks (e. g., days <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> through customs, days to get a telephone line, sales lost to power outages). For many of these costs, the obstacles are lower in China than in Bangladesh or India, which in turn are superior to Pakistan. There is also systematic variation across cities within countries. The authors estimate a production function for garment firms and show that total factor productivity is systematically related to the investment climate indicators. Factor returns (wages for a given quality of human capital and rate of profit) are also higher where investment climate is better. These higher returns then have dynamic effects: accumulation and growth at the firm level is higher where investment climate is good. * We {{would like to thank}} Aart Kraay, Norman Loayza, and John Sutton for helpful comments on an initial draft of this paper and Sergio Kurlat and Victoria Levin for excellent research assistance.

40|$|Drawing on {{recently}} completed firm-level surveys in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Honduras, India, Nicaragua, Pakistan, and Peru, this paper investigates {{the relationship between}} investment climate and international integration. These standardized surveys of large, random samples of firms in common sectors reveal how firms experience bottlenecks and delays in hard infrastructure such as power and telecom {{as well as in}} soft infrastructure such as customs administration. The authors focus primarily on measures of the time or monetary cost of different bottlenecks (e. g., days <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> through customs, days to get a telephone line, sales lost to power outages). For many of these costs, the obstacles are lower in China than in the South Asian or Latin American countries. There is also systematic variation across cities within countries. The authors estimate a probit function for the probability that a randomly chosen firm is foreign-invested and a separate probit for the probability that a randomly chosen firm is an exporter. These measures of international integration are higher where investment climate isbetter. For locations to take advantage of opportunities in the international market, they need good infrastructure and a sound regulatory environment. The interaction of openness and sound investment climate creates a good environment for investment and production. This paper helps explain why China has been so successful over the past decade, both in terms of integration and of rapid growth, while other countries have had varied success.

50|$|These {{documentary}} requirements {{may result in}} two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can {{be an issue in}} certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the <b>goods</b> for export, meaning that the goods may be declared {{in the name of the}} seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} {{restrictions}} on firm entry affect intersectoral factor reallocation when open economies experience global economic shocks. In our theoretical framework, countries trade freely {{in a range}} of differentiated sectors that are subject to country-specific and global shocks. Entry restrictions are modeled as an upper bound on the introduction of new differentiated goods following shocks. Prices and quantities adjust <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> international <b>goods</b> markets, and wages adjust <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> national labor markets. We show that in general equilibrium, countries with tighter entry restrictions see less factor reallocation compared to the frictionless benchmark. In our empirical work, we compare sectoral employment reallocation across countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s with proxies for frictionless benchmark reallocation. Our results indicate that the gap between actual and frictionless reallocation is greater in countries where it takes longer to start a firm...|$|R

It is the conclusion of this paper that Thornton has no case to answer; the evidence not only from Thornton's own early work on wages and trade unions, together with additional corroborative evidence suggests that far from having plagiarized Longe's (1866) work, Thornton apticipated many of his ideas.

50|$|The Junction was a {{manufacturing}} community that rose quickly {{during the late}} 19th century. Foundries, mills, furniture assembly, meat processing, nail and wire factories were established. Notable companies, such as Canadian Cycle & Motor Co., Campbell Milling Company and the Heintzman piano company {{set up in the}} area. Other firms came because land, labour and taxes were cheaper than in Toronto, and the Canadian Pacific established a major operation there, establishing yards from Keele Street as far west as Scarlett Road. In addition, the town acquired an official port of entry in the 1890s, allowing local businesses <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> their <b>goods</b> locally as opposed to using the downtown Toronto port. These factors also attracted many immigrant or second generation Irish Catholics to the area, many of whom moved there from then poor, crowded tenement housing in areas of the city such as Cabbagetown and Brockton Village during the 1880s. Many also came from working-class English industrial cities such as Birmingham and Manchester. They were soon followed by many from non-English speaking countries, including Italians, Poles, Macedonian and Croatian immigrants, many of whom worked in the meat industry.|$|R

When she is unsuccessful, she remembers that she had rested her head on Jimmy's shoulder earlier and asks him to check his pockets to see if the earring was there. Jimmy misunderstands and thinks that Fisher is accusing him of stealing the jewelry. He becomes furious, as his father was fired from a job once for stealing, and demands that she search his jacket.

The line was {{operating}} at a small profit at this time but despite protests British Railways took the view that the cost of a new bridge was an unreasonably large investment. The final normal service train ran on the evening of 2 November 1963. Goods services continued until the final day but goods trains were not run separately. Instead goods were conveyed in mixed trains (passenger coaches, goods wagons and vans, and a brake van) and these were a feature of the branch until the end. <b>To</b> <b>clear</b> the remaining <b>goods</b> stock away, the final train from Hayling Island on Saturday 2 November 1963 was a mixed train hauled by A1X no. 32650. The day after closure a special was run, hauled by A1X nos. 32636 and 32670 and this was the last ever train on the branch. All three of these locomotives survive in preservation.|$|R
