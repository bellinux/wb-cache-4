40|$|Axis <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> {{fractures}} are infrequent injuries {{attributed to}} hyper extension and flexion of neck. In unstable <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fractures {{there will be}} posterior displacement of vertebral body, anterior longitudinal ligament disruption and anterior rotation of antero-inferior vertebral body fragment. Most of the unstable <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fractures are associated with neurological deficit due to incomplete spinal cord injuries like anterior cord syndrome. We present a case of traumatic unstable C 2 flexion <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture without neurological deficit. We have treated the patient successfully with anterior cervical plating and tricortical bone grafting after removal of <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fragment and discectomy. This patient was mobilized on next day after surgery and neck mobilization started after 3 weeks. The patient in our study was followed up for 6 years and found to have no sequlae related to the injury. Unstable <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture needs to be fixed irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of neurological deficit. Open reduction internal fixation with low profile plate and tricortical bone graft, shaped to fit the defect and disc space, through high anterior retropharyngeal approach is a promising treatment for unstable <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fractures...|$|R
40|$|An unusual {{crack growth}} {{mechanism}} {{has been observed}} in fine grained Udimet 720 at moderate temperatures. Fracture surfaces consisting of a <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> shaped region of stage II crack growth bounded by regions of shear crack growth have been observed above room temperature. The current study investigates the effect of temperature, environment, and specimen geometry on the <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> cracking phenomenon. Vacuum conditions are found to retain <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> cracking behaviour at higher temperatures than observed by other workers. <b>Tear</b> <b>drop</b> cracking {{has been established in}} a number of specimen geometries and it is demonstrated that further analysis of the effects of crack tip shielding during this macroscopically tortuous crack growth is required to fully evaluate the effects of such crack growth behaviour on component lifing...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>tear</b> <b>drop,</b> {{also called}} a runner or a floater, is usually {{performed}} by undersized players (mainly point guards). A player usually starts the layup procedure a good distance {{away from the}} basket. The ball is generally released earlier and in a higher arc than the normal layup. The ball should be away before the taller defender has the chance to block it. The purpose of this shooting move {{is to make the}} defender miss blocking the ball as the ball is released from the hand one moment sooner than expected. It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling <b>tear</b> <b>drop.</b> Gary Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics and John Stockton of the Utah Jazz during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best <b>tear</b> <b>drops</b> in the game. Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors frequently use the <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> with great success. [...] Antawn Jamison had one of the most highly effective <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> shots in the league despite being a power forward. Ben Gordon of the Charlotte Bobcats, Juan Carlos Navarro of FC Barcelona, Steve Nash (Retired), Rajon Rondo of the Chicago Bulls, J.J. Barea from the Dallas Mavericks, and Derrick Rose from the New York Knicks are currently known for the <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> move.|$|R
40|$|Study Design: This is a {{retrospective}} study. Purpose: We wanted {{to evaluate the}} clinical results of surgical and conservative treatment for cervical <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture. Overview of Literature: The <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture of the lower cervical spine is generally associated with {{a high incidence of}} neurological deficits and surgery is needed to treat this injury. <b>Tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture of C 2 is usually a stable fracture that is amendable to conservative treatment. Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of 25 patients. Cervical <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture was classified as the extension and flexion types according to the mechanism of injury. The neurologic symptoms were evaluated by the Frankel classification system, and the loss of lordosis and disc height, and the duration of bony union were analyzed. Results: Twenty one patients had the flexion type injury and 4 patients had the extension type injury. All the patients with the flexion type were treated by anterior decompression and plate stabilization. All the patients with the extension type were treated conservatively. Ten patients with the flexion type had neurologic deficits. The nerve root injuries recovered fully and the incomplete injuries had an average 1. 5 grade recovery. Radiologically, the extension type fracture showed bony union at an average of 12. 8 weeks. For the patients with the flexion type fracture, the loss of lordosis was 2. 6 �and the loss of disc height was 2. 1 mm. The period of bony union in 20 cases was 13. 0 weeks. Conclusions: Anterior plate stabilization was an effective treatment for the flexion type <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture. Conservative treatment is thought {{to be one of the}} good clinical methods for treating the extension type <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> fracture.
