5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated that he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the play {{in a way that}} would shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

25|$|By modern {{standards}} CP/M was primitive, {{owing to}} the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this danger was reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> to it, the operating system would signal a fatal error, avoiding overwriting but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data you were trying to save).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{was born}} in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an atheist after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his {{grandmother}} described. His brother Edward, {{two and a half}} years younger, died at age sixteen of a cerebral hemorrhage. He attended Hamilton College in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude. While attending, he joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an experimental science from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the Skinner Box and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments. After graduation, he unsuccessfully <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years. He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet Robert Frost, concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's Behaviorism led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.|$|E

500|$|Pohl's writing career spans 70 years, and {{includes}} over 50 science fiction novels and numerous short stories. He also won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards several times. One of Pohl's fascinations has been mathematics, in particular number theory. He would often spend {{his spare time}} [...] "playing" [...] with prime numbers, and even <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a formula for generating primes. But he did invent several mathematical parlour tricks, {{some of which are}} featured in The Last Theorem.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "How Orlo Got His Book", he {{described}} Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young {{child who was}} turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided {{to write a book}} for children like Orlo but found the task [...] "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love". He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a story called [...] "The Queen Zebra" [...] but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters [...] "q" [...] and [...] "z" [...] did not appear on the list at all. He then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a story about a bird, without using the word bird as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a [...] "wing thing" [...] instead but struggled as he discovered that it [...] "couldn't have legs or a beak or a tail. Neither a left foot or a right foot." [...] On his approach to writing The Cat in the Hat he wrote, [...] "The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [...] without stroodles." ...|$|E
500|$|Hebel's admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller and Tolstoy. Goethe, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a poem (the [...] "Schweizerlied", Swiss song) in Alemannic himself, {{praised the}} Allemannische Gedichte highly. According to him, Hebel [...] "countrified the {{universe}} in the most naive, graceful fashion". But {{on the question of}} whether he would translate Hebel's works, Goethe said: [...] "Such a great poet should be only read in the original! One just needs to learn this language!" [...] The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814.|$|E

500|$|... "Creep" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American group TLC for their second studio album CrazySexyCool (1994). It was written and produced by Dallas Austin, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the track from his [...] "female perspective" [...] while basing on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins's real story of infidelity. The lyrics portray the singers as women that cheat back at their lovers for the attention.

500|$|The writers did {{not want}} {{to spend a lot of}} time {{covering}} Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost [...] $100,000.
