40|$|This Diploma Thesis "Moral Aspects of Fairy Tales" asks {{questions}} - Is {{it possible}} to find God's message in <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales?</b> Can God speak to us through these stories? Can <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> be touched by history of redemption? In the beginning, this Diploma Thesis speaks about myth, about it's origin, functions and message, because <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> have their roots in myth. For better apprehension of <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales,</b> there is used the theory of narrative as well as theory and history of <b>fairy</b> <b>tales.</b> <b>The</b> Diploma Thesis analyzes Jung's Archetypes.

5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a much more complex villain than <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale</b> witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn {{to serve as a}} foil to Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale</b> stories.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} {{unsuccessfully to}} adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s. Following {{the success of}} The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale,</b> which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical. Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually dismissed Purdum's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to The Little Mermaid instead. The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton story first credited to Roger Allers. Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken wrote the film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as the film's executive producer, died of AIDS-related complications eight months before the film's release, and the film is thus dedicated to his memory.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale</b> stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma {{to pay a}} visit to Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale</b> Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tale,</b> Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
5|$|Janáček's {{deep and}} lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture {{represents}} another {{important element of}} his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought {{in connection with the}} use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit of Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write <b>the</b> <b>Fairy</b> <b>Tale</b> for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: Káťa Kabanová, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's vision of the world into an exciting collective drama.|$|E

40|$|The first, {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} diploma thesis presents the life and work of Gašper Križnik, what is the kinship between {{the author of the}} diploma thesis, cultural and local characteristics of Motnik and Križnik’s definition of Motnik dialect. Gašper Križnik has been writing down folk material, such as fairytales, tales, riddles, songs and sent them to different institutions and collectors, among others to Karel Štrekelj. A lot of his materials is therefore collected and preserved in Štrekelj’s legacy. In the second part I defined folk’s fairytales and analyzed a couple of Križnik’s <b>fairy</b> <b>tales,</b> namely Od povodniga moža and Od sowčne zvezde. I compared both <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> with <b>the</b> model of <b>the</b> European <b>fairy</b> <b>tale</b> i. e. with <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> of J. and W. Grimm as well as with <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> of A. Štefan. I used a theoretical research, where I gave the emphasis to studying literature. I used the descriptive method by analyzing and comparing different contents and documents and quantitative method, for I read, analyzed and compared six different <b>fairy</b> <b>tales.</b> In <b>the</b> process of writing the thesis I focused on the following research questions and hypotheses: -	In what way are Križnik’s <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> and other European <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> similar and in what way are they distinctive? -	What are the cultural characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> of that time? -	What are the local characteristics of <b>the</b> selected <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> of that time? The goal of the thesis is to evaluate the work of Gašper Križnik. He has been writing down <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> in <b>the</b> dialects of that time and has thus preserved them until today. I wished to discover how the language has differed through individual places and regions and whether Križnik’s <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> and <b>the</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>tales</b> of J. and W. Grimm are similar in anything. ...|$|R
