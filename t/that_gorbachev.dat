5|$|Historian Jerry F. Hough notes <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> treated Ryzhkov and his reform {{attempts}} just {{as badly}} as Leonid Brezhnev treated Alexei Kosygin, one-time Chairman of the Council of Ministers, during the Brezhnev Era. Brezhnev's most notable snub was over the 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990 Ryzhkov {{suffered}} a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers {{and replaced it with}} the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov's hospitalisation and Pavlov's election as Prime Minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government's hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough's view <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> had little reason to remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were good reasons to replace him given that with Ryzhkov's Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> reforms came with sweeping, {{unintended}} consequences, as nationalities of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union pulled harder than ever to break away from the union and ultimately dismantle the Communist Party.|$|R
50|$|Lukyanov was {{an early}} {{political}} ally of Mikhail Gorbachev, supporting his efforts in {{issues such as the}} fight against corruption and the start of reforms in the economy; however, beginning in 1987-88, he increasingly sympathized with the party establishment, correctly foreseeing <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> policies unleashed forces that would destroy the USSR.|$|R

5|$|Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, {{had told}} Pavlov {{of the coup}} on 18 August, one day before it began. He was asked by Kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the Moscow Kremlin, where on 19 August, he and his co-conspirators {{appeared}} on live television and told the Soviet people <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was indisposed. As the day wore on it soon became apparent that Pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself. In retrospect {{he admitted that he}} had been drinking with his son the day before. On the same day, his fellow plotters decided to depose Pavlov, sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him. As with all the others, Pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup. Shortly after Pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody. He was released on bail in January 1993 and granted amnesty by the Russian State Duma in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{opposition}} {{within the}} Politburo and the Central Committee led to Khrushchev's removal as First Secretary. Leonid Brezhnev succeeded Khrushchev {{to the post}} as part of another collective leadership, together with Premier Alexei Kosygin and others. The office was renamed General Secretary in 1966. The collective leadership was able to limit {{the powers of the}} General Secretary during the Brezhnev Era. Brezhnev's influence grew throughout the 1970s as he was able to retain support by avoiding any radical reforms. Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko ruled the country {{in the same way as}} Brezhnev had. Mikhail Gorbachev ruled the Soviet Union as General Secretary until 1990, when the Communist Party lost its monopoly of power over the political system. The office of President of the Soviet Union was established so <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> still retained his role as leader of the Soviet Union. Following the failed August coup of 1991, Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary. He was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Ivashko, who only served for five days as Acting General Secretary before Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, suspended all activity in the Communist Party. Following the party's ban, the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP–CPSU) was established by Oleg Shenin in 1993. The UCP–CPSU works as a framework for reviving and restoring the CPSU. The organisation has members in all the former Soviet republics.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 2014, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was in hospital and in deteriorating health. However, on 16 October he granted an interview with Russian state newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, opining on the Ukraine crisis and calling for a repeal of the sanctions.|$|E
5000|$|Commentators {{assessing}} {{the results of}} the Conference, and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed. Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of [...] "status quo-plus" [...] rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control [...] "soaring expectations" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> speech unleashed.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} causes contributed to CPSU's {{loss of control}} and the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union. Some historians have written <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> policy of glasnost (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. <b>Gorbachev</b> maintained <b>that</b> perestroika without glasnost was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the economic stagnation and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology.|$|R
5000|$|At the time, Eastern European analysts viewed this rhetoric {{as a way}} for Gorbachev {{to prevent}} an {{outright}} revolt of Eastern European countries from the Soviet bloc. [...] Jim Hoagland wrote <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> [...] "Common European Home" [...] and Bush's [...] "Europe Whole and Free" [...] were competing concepts describing the same situation: an economic and ideological collapse of Soviet power concurrent with the European Community gaining new dynamism and economic clout.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the pretense}} <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was ill, his vice president, Yanayev, {{took over as}} president. Gorbachev spent three days (19, 20, and 21 August) under house arrest at his dacha in the Crimea before being freed and {{restored}} to power. However, upon his return, Gorbachev found that neither Union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands, as support had swung over to Yeltsin, whose defiance had led to the coup's collapse.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1990, Yeltsin {{was elected}} to the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia {{representing}} Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote. On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), {{in spite of the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select Yeltsin. He was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet, which sought power in the developing political situation in the country.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{appeared}} in numerous media channels after his resignation from office. In 1993, he appeared as {{himself in the}} Wim Wenders film Faraway, So Close!, the sequel to Wings of Desire. In 1997, Gorbachev appeared with his granddaughter Anastasia in an internationally screened television commercial for Pizza Hut. The U.S. corporation's payment for the 60-second ad went to Gorbachev's non-profit Gorbachev Foundation. In 2007, French luxury brand Louis Vuitton announced <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> would be shown in an ad campaign, shot by Annie Leibovitz, for their signature luggage. In February 2014, during the winter Olympic Games held in Sochi, Russia, 82-year-old Gorbachev made a rare appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in a segment where he was tracked down and interviewed by comedic correspondent Jason Jones on location from Moscow.|$|E
30|$|However, the Cold War rivalry was not permanent. Mikhail Gorbachev, the {{new leader}} of the Soviet Union, {{introduced}} a series of unilateral measures to reduce tension emanating from the Cold War rivalry, especially {{in the areas of}} disarmament and arms reduction. Many believe <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> actions were influenced by domestic socioeconomic compulsions. The reform programs {{the new leader}} introduced culminated in the dismantling of the socialist bloc states and eventually the Soviet Union itself bringing the Cold War to an end (Collins 1998).|$|R

500|$|In June 1991, Pavlov {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> {{planned to}} replace him as Prime Minister. In response, {{he arrived at the}} Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union [...] "visibly nervous", and in his report to the Supreme Soviet, he was forced to tell delegates of the faltering state of the Soviet economy. However, Pavlov blamed this on the ongoing War of Laws between the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which, he argued, could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across the entire Soviet Union, or at least in certain economic sectors.|$|E
500|$|On 19 August, {{citizens}} of Moscow gathered around Russia's White House {{and began to}} erect barricades around it, in which at 16:00 Yanayev responded by declaring {{a state of emergency}} in Moscow. Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was [...] "resting". He said: [...] "Over these years he has become very tired and needs some time to get his health back." [...] Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev's weak posture, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing. According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind; Kryuchkov has been described as the [...] "heart and soul of the conspiracy". Yanayev only agreed to head the Emergency Committee on 20August. Along with the other coup leaders, such as Valentin Pavlov and Boris Pugo for instance, Yanayev was dismissed as Vice President and later jailed for his [...] "crimes" [...] against the Soviet state.|$|E

2500|$|Gorbachev's {{election}} to the General Secretaryship was the quickest in Soviet history. The Politburo recommended Gorbachev to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee approved him. The Politburo meeting, which elected Gorbachev to the General Secretaryship, did not include such members as Dinmukhamed Konayev, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and Vitaly Vorotnikov. Of these three, Konayev and Shcherbytsky were Brezhnevites, and Vorotnikov, while not supporting Gorbachev, {{took it for granted}} <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> would succeed Chernenko. It is conceivable, according to historian Archie Brown, that Konayev and Shcherbytsky would rather have voted in favour of Viktor Grishin as General Secretary, than Gorbachev. At the same meeting, Grishin was asked to chair the commission responsible for Chernenko's funeral; Grishin turned down the offer, claiming <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was closer to Chernenko than he was. By doing this, he practically signaled his support for Gorbachev's ascension to the General Secretaryship. Andrei Gromyko, the longtime foreign minister, proposed Gorbachev as a candidate for the General Secretaryship. The Politburo and the Central Committee elected Gorbachev as General Secretary unanimously. Ryzhkov, in retrospect, claimed that the Soviet system had [...] "created, nursed and formed" [...] Gorbachev, but that [...] "long ago Gorbachev had internally rebelled against the native System." [...] In the same vein, Gorbachev's adviser Andrey Grachev, noted that he was a [...] "genetic error of the system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around the 50th {{anniversary of}} {{the signing of the}} 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in July 1989, the Soviet {{government}} formally acknowledged that the plan had included the placing of the Baltic states into the Soviet sphere of influence, which paved the way for their annexation into the USSR in 1940. The revelation supported the long-denied proposition that the Baltic states had been involuntarily brought into the Soviet Union, and so it boosted the Baltic aspirations to reestablish their independence. Finally, the Eastern bloc fragmented in the autumn of 1989, and Gorbachev made the decision not to use military force {{in order to maintain the}} Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. [...] This raised hopes <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> would extend his non-interventionist doctrine to the internal workings of the USSR.|$|E
2500|$|Two more {{events in}} 1988 persuaded Shultz that Soviet {{intentions}} were changing. First, the Soviet Union's initial withdrawal from Afghanistan {{indicated that the}} Brezhnev Doctrine was dead. [...] "If the Soviets left Afghanistan, the Brezhnev Doctrine would be breached, and the principle of 'never letting go' would be violated," [...] Shultz reasoned. The second event, according to Keren Yarhi-Milo of Princeton University, happened during the nineteenth Communist Party Conference, [...] "at which Gorbachev proposed major domestic reforms such as the establishment of competitive elections with secret ballots; term limits for elected officials; separation of powers with an independent judiciary; and provisions for freedom of speech, assembly, conscience, and the press." [...] The proposals indicated <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was making revolutionary and irreversible changes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{controversy}} {{about the importance}} duly attributed to domestic and international sources {{of the end of}} the Cold War. Our quasi-experimental research supports the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> accession to power was largely responsible for the historic improvement in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. The leadership change also enabled the Soviets to pursue unilateral initiatives although conflictual behavior supplanted the effect of such GRIT measures. The coercive diplomacy of the United States in the 1980 s seems to have contributed to the moderation of Soviet foreign policy to a lesser extent The Box-Tiao models focus on the period between 1948 and 1989 and rely on an updated version of the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) ...|$|R
5000|$|Foreign media faced many {{restrictions}} when {{covering the}} Tiananmen protests. After {{the declaration of}} martial law, foreign media was no longer permitted to visit Tiananmen Square. Foreign correspondents gave reports from guest rooms in tourist hotels; these became the backdrop for many live broadcasts from American networks. [...] This ban was originally not strictly enforced, but soon security personnel and police spoke to foreign media correspondents and pushed them to leave stating <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> visit had ended. Author Nan Lin states that when the journalists were slow in leaving, “forceful actions were taken to block news gathering and transmission”. Photography of the Square was also not permitted. Transporting film from Beijing became difficult, often requiring it to be taken apart frame by frame, sent out on ordinary phone lines, and reconstituted elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 1991, Bush {{arrived in}} Moscow for a summit with Mikhail Gorbachev.

Bush told <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>that</b> {{it would not be}} in America's interest for the Soviet Union to collapse, though hardline members of Bush's Republican Party—most notably Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney—embraced this outcome.

Aside from the fact that no one had ever before quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever addressed a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s. In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of [...] "political immaturity" [...] and [...] "absolute irresponsibility". Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin.|$|E
2500|$|Coit D.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores {{the events in}} the Soviet Union that preceded the August 1991 coup. In addition, it will examine the failure of the coup itself. Using a methodology of policy analysis, two questions are investigated. The first is why did Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev seemingly align himself with conservatives during the Fall and Winter of 1990 - 1991 ? Secondly, once the conservatives were in a position to control the USSR, why did they fail? The first question is answered by showing <b>that</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> movement away from reform was a pragmatic effort to retain his power as President of the USSR. The second question is answered by presenting evidence that reforms within the USSR had progressed to such a point that the media and the people were able to perform an important role in defeating the coup. The fact {{that the majority of the}} Armed Forces failed to support the plotters was also very significant. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
