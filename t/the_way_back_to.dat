5|$|Raynald made a plundering raid in {{the valley}} of the river Euphrates at Marash to seize cattle, horses and camels from the local peasants in November 1160 or 1161. Majd al-Din, {{governor}} of Aleppo, attacked Raynald and his retinue on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Antioch. Raynald fought bravely, but the Muslim warriors unhorsed and captured him. He was sent to Aleppo where he was put in jail.|$|E
5|$|After this battle, the Rhodian admirals {{decided to}} leave Chios and sail back home. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he {{received}} at Chios, but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus {{on the shore of}} Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone.|$|E
5|$|By {{morning of}} January 3, Washington had reached Princeton. After a brief battle, the British there were decisively {{defeated}} and {{a substantial number}} of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured. With their third defeat in ten days, Cornwallis' superior, General William Howe, ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York. This they did, leaving forward positions at New Brunswick. Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters.|$|E

Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman falling asleep and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana.

5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E

5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely {{a year after the}} mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E

5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying American forces in China. This air organization was formed to carry supplies over the Hump, the air route replacement for the enemy-held Burma Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When Burma appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes {{and a handful of}} other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in Burma on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Assam.|$|E
5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rome.|$|E

Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes.

5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple.

He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E

At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian).

Both the armies of the Lower and Upper Rhine had returned to order. It seemed prudent to satisfy the armies, but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the Marsi, a Germanic people on the upper Ruhr river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E
