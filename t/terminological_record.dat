50|$|TERMIUM was {{initially}} developed to contain <b>terminological</b> <b>records</b> {{in both of}} Canada’s official languages (English and French). As the system upgraded to its third-generation version in 1985, it contained records in other languages such as Spanish, {{in order to accommodate}} its growing range of users. It is worth noting, however, that in these “multilingual” records, the term in the source language would be in English or French, with its equivalent in a non-official language.|$|R
50|$|As <b>terminological</b> <b>records</b> {{grew in the}} TERMIUM database, the Canadian {{government}} {{received a}} proposal, in 1985, from a Toronto-based company to launch TERMIUM in a CD-ROM format, {{in order to make}} the database more accessible to users. By fall of 1987, a pilot project for CD-ROM was launched to investigate the responses from its users, which included services under the Translation Bureau and other private Canadian companies. After some data compilation and investigation, the bureau incorporated an indexing system to improve the speed and accuracy of term extraction.|$|R

50|$|A {{frequently}} cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published {{report by the}} United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) — although they discourage this practice. In 2012, {{according to the report}} by UNODC, Sweden was quoted as having 66.5 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, based on official statistics by Brå. The high number of reported rapes in Sweden can partly be explained by differing legal systems, offence definitions, <b>terminological</b> variations, <b>recording</b> practices and statistical conventions, making any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult.|$|R
40|$|Mental {{practice}} {{is a strategy}} {{that can be used}} to acquire the necessary skills for piano and other music performance. This type of practice strategy involves the use of imagery as opposed to the motor skills used in physical practice. In a preliminary review of piano pedagogy material and recent scientific literature, the benefits of mental practice were established. However, this review also revealed a lack of clarity in the use of terminology which sometimes interfered with readability. In order to better understand this problem of terminology, 33 current studies on mental practice in music performance were collected and examined for both the quantity and quality of term usage. Terms were identified and recorded using existing terminology and classification methods. <b>Terminological</b> <b>records</b> were created for each term appearing more than twice in the literature. In total, 83 records were created. Issues related to frequency of use (repetition), use of multiple terms (synonymy), lack of term definitions, and the need for clarity in term usage (semantic vagueness and ambiguity) were then analyzed using these records. This term analysis process resulted in the creation of a glossary and taxonomy. The glossary of 21 terms and corresponding hierarchical taxonomy (tree diagram) are proposed as an aid to help clarify the terminology of mental practice in music performance. Given the value of mental practice in learning to play music it is important to develop and maintain terminology that will facilitate both the understanding of existing literature and the design of future studies...|$|R
50|$|A {{frequently}} cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published {{report by the}} United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), based on official statistics provided by each member state. In 2012, Sweden had 66 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå). This was unequivocally the biggest number reported to the UNODC in 2012. However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, <b>terminological</b> variations, <b>recording</b> practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult, {{which is why the}} UNODC itself caution against using their figures. It {{should also be noted that}} many countries do not report any rape statistics at all to the UNODC, and some report very low numbers, despite studies that indicate otherwise.|$|R
40|$|In LSP {{dictionaries}} the specialised knowledge contained and organised in texts {{is selected}} and restructured. This paper {{is focused on}} the analysis of a case study: the "Dizionario generale plurilingue del Lessico Metalinguistico" (DLM – General Multilingual Dictionary of the Metalinguistic Lexicon). The dictionary of linguistics terminology under examination is planned to complement the reference products available in this area of knowledge. In fact, it has a particular outline as the materials it records are directly drawn from the most representative texts produced throughout the history of linguistic speculation (§ 2.). The plan of the DLM establishes that the terminological information stored (definitions, cross-references, formal variants, translations) is directly drawn from the original texts, and not elaborated by the compilers. Therefore, the definitions of the indexed terms are not produced by terminographers: they are ‘defining quotations’ identified and extracted by specialists from the source texts. Specialised texts play an essential role in this project as they are analysed in order to both identify the core concepts used (or introduced) by their authors and to reconstruct the conceptual networks delineated in each of them. In the compilation of the DLM the problematic issues inherent in textual analysis clearly emerge (§ 3.). This {{is due to the fact}} that texts are multifaceted units where the various factors related to their structural organisation and informative content interact. The different degrees of ‘density’ of specialised information which is displayed in texts is determined, among others, by the conceptual, communicative, pragmatic, structural, cognitive, and socio-cultural components of LSP texts (§ 3. 1.). The procedures of retrieval and organisation of specialised knowledge carried out in the DLM project are analysed in this study through the consideration of a sub-section of its terminological inventory, i. e. the metalinguistic units extracted from a text in which focal linguistic issues are discussed (§ 4.). Although this book was produced in the pre-scientific period of the history of linguistics, it was chosen because, in addition to providing interesting contributions to linguistics terminology – considered also from a historical viewpoint –, it yields a model for the arrangement of the conceptual relational network which is being implemented for the DLM (§ 4. 1.). The bi-dimensional character of <b>terminological</b> <b>records</b> of the DLM is being integrated with graphic representations of conceptual relations, which provide a multidimensional outline to the defining section of this dictionary. The visual representation of relational networks provides further terminological information and it also makes available to the users an effective instrument for acquiring a more thorough understanding of the specialised knowledge which is transferred from LSP texts into this dictionary...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a perspective on}} the possibility of harnessing sociocognitive terminology and related practices to the aim of describing philosophical terminology. In this case, the terminology of the radical constructivist philosopher Ernst von Glasersfeld is surveyed as a starting point. The experimental <b>terminological</b> <b>records</b> produced are re-incorporated into the theoretical basis constituted by the thesis. Therefore, its aim can be seen as twofold; the description of philosophical terminology also entails theory construction. The practice described can be seen as regenerative theory construction. It incorporates elements of formulation and of codification/ language engineering in terms of contemporary computational possibilities. In terms of its theoretical basis, the project extends not only to the terminology used in the corpus texts but also to concepts and terms needed to understand these in the first place. The outlook can be described as heuristic and experimental. The approach breaks down to the following sub-problems. Each can be seen as characteristic for terminology description in the human sciences: (1) The idea of conceptual entities and concept description needs to be adjusted to the field of experience. This starts from sociocognitive terminology and incorporates the anthropological view of concept analysis. (2) The conceptual entity of stereotype has to be accounted for, as the variance of the descriptions of immaterial objects suggests that they can only be apprehended in a radically simplified manner. (3) The application of prototype theory employed as by sociocognitive theory and the Aristotelian concept theory of (post-) classical terminology research needs to be adapted to the description of ideal types. This is compressed into the concept of scientificity. (4) The principles developed need to be compressed into the conventional categories of principle and approach. These categories need to be set in relation to both philosophical concepts and experience. (5) This design of a possible practice needs to be adapted to existing procedures. The existing procedures may be in need of clarification or redefinition against the background of their usage in non-standard contexts. (6) To facilitate this mutual adaptation, peculiarities of the context of philosophical terminography are explored and compressed under the concept of disciplinarity. To this, there is a declarative aspect and a procedural one. (7) The procedural approach to disciplinarity develops an understanding of the intentional aspect of agenda and interest. These orient the development of potential consensus about disciplinarity within the constraints of context and therefore the apparent identity of (sub- (sub-)) cultures inside the context. (8) Following these observations, the overall theoretical and methodological construct is tested against exemplary cases. To conclude, a practice for implementing these considerations is suggested. It includes the use of text fragments as units for textographic philosophical terminography and an understanding of computational information management practices appropriate to its principles...|$|R

Møller {{interviews}} Lisbeth Kjeldgaard Almsten (translator/coauthor: Birthe Toft) “If {{you think}} that terminology work is {{simply a matter of}} buying terminology management software and getting started, you are in for trouble” At Crisplant, we have been doing terminology management for the past 20 years. Today, term bases are used not just for terminology-oriented term management. Recording other types of master data needed by all kinds of professionals in the enterprise is equally important. Within the past year, Crisplant has been acquired by the German BEUMER group, which means that the terminological resources of the two enterprises {{are in the process of}} being integrated. The challenges presented by this process demonstrate the importance of adhering to <b>terminological</b> principles when <b>recording</b> terminology resources, while at the same time reminding us what an essential discipline terminology management really is, in enterprise practice as well as in education.   Lisbeth Kjeldgaard Almsten Project Manager & Linguistic Coordinator at Chrisplant.
