Spotnitz later explained, [...] "it's similar [...] in the sense <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> always thought happened to Samantha may not have actually happened. 'Paper Hearts' never ultimately answers the question. We've had people come up to us and say, 'Okay, so we know she's really dead, so what happened?' So we decided in this one to answer the question." [...] The episode's title, Sein und Zeit, is a reference to Martin Heidegger's best known work and means [...] "Being and Time" [...] in German.|$|E

2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until {{what you}} notice {{is not the}} movement itself but the distinctiveness of {{the bodies of the}} performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing.

2500|$|Michael Madhusudan Dutt (1824–1873) {{introduced}} blank verse (Amitrakshar Chhanda), literary epics and sonnets in Bengali language. Dutt’s first epic Tilottama Sambhab Kabya (তিলোত্তমাসম্ভব কাব্য, Birth of Tilottama) {{was published}} in 1860. This was the first Bengali poem written in blank verse. The story of Tilottama Sambhab Kabya is taken from Hindu Puranas. Dutt's greatest work Meghnad Badh Kabya (মেঘনাদবধ কাব্য, Slaying of Meghnad) {{was published in}} two parts in 1861. The story of Meghnad Badh Kabya was borrowed from Hindu epic the Ramayana and deals chiefly the final battle, death and funeral of Meghnad, son of Ravana during the Lanka War. Dutt also wrote a lyrical poem–Brajangana Kavya (ব্রজাঙ্গনা কাব্য, Women from Braj, 1861)–and an epistolary poem Birangana Kavya (বীরাঙ্গনা কাব্য, Valiant Ladies, 1861–62). Dutt’s last book of poems, Chaturdashpadi Kabitabali (চতুর্দশপদী কবিতাবলী, Sonnets), {{is a collection of}} 102 sonnets written at Versailles, France in 1865. Dutt also wrote four plays–Sharmishtha (শর্মিষ্ঠা, 1859), Padmavati (পদ্মাবতী, 1860), Krishnakumari (কৃষ্ণকুমারী, 1861) and Maya-Kanan (মায়া-কানন, The Magical Forest, 1874)–and two farces–Ekei Ki Bole Sabhyata?

Craven points out that early on he suggested that Krug have a son who commits suicide, but found it interesting to see [...] "this strange Romeo and Juliet thing happening" [...] between Krug's son and Mari. He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real."
