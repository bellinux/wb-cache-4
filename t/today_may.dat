5|$|As {{threats to}} bird populations grow and extinctions continue, {{historical}} specimens are valuable in documenting {{the impacts of}} human activities and causes of decline for threatened species. Bird collections have also been used to gauge the flow of environmental pollutants over time. A study of soot deposits on specimens collected within the United States Manufacturing Belt was used to track concentrations of atmospheric black carbon over a 135-year span. Other possible uses for bird specimens not known <b>today</b> <b>may</b> arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} <b>today</b> <b>may</b> once have existed {{in a slightly}} different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E

Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches.

25|$|Moreover, Giolitti, {{differently}} from his predecessors like Francesco Crispi, strongly opposed {{the repression of}} labour union strikes. According to him, the government had {{to act as a}} mediator between entrepreneurs and workers.

The conservatives harshly criticized him; according to them this policy was a complete failure that could create fear and disorder.|$|E

25|$|The {{expansion}} of mandolin use continued after World War II {{through the late}} 1960s, and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins, with active orchestras and university music programs.

Japanese mandolin orchestras <b>today</b> <b>may</b> consist of up to 40 or 50 members, and can include woodwind, percussion, and brass sections.

25|$|For {{the most}} part {{advances}} in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production {{have been added to}} basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons/h of crushed rock, whereas the same size crusher manufactured <b>today</b> <b>may</b> produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.|$|E

Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to do when the parade proper begins.|$|E

For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one.

Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased <b>today</b> <b>may</b> drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw.

25|$|Many of {{the debates}} {{surrounding}} the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of {{both private and public}} enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt <b>today</b> <b>may</b> or may not enhance {{the quality of life for}} future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.|$|E
25|$|After the British {{successfully}} occupied Manila {{and surrounding}} suburbs in 1762–1764 during the Seven Years' War, the colonial government led by Simón de Anda y Salazar fled to Bacolor, Pampanga through Polo. The British followed Anda, {{and at one}} point stayed in sitio Mabolo while waiting for orders from Governor Dawsonne Drake. They explored the nearby communities of Malanday, Wakas, Dalandanan, Pasolo, Rincon and Malinta. The terrified local population fled and sought refuge in the forests of Viente Reales where many of them died of malaria. The British then proceed to Malolos, Bulacan where they were ambushed by the stationed Spanish soldiers. After the chase, the local population of Polo returned to their homes on May 12, 1763 after days of reconstruction. <b>Today,</b> <b>May</b> 12 every year is celebrated as the feast of St. Roch, or San Roque, another patron saint, and as a memorial to those who died in the Seven Years' War.|$|E
