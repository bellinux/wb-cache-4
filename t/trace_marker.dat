40|$|Pollution is {{of concern}} for {{human health and the}} environment. Authorities have set {{concentration}} frames for many pollutants. Therefore, monitoring is required in industrial and farming activities, for example. Methods based on gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry are mainly utilized in the study of trace pollutants in the environmental samples. The main reason for that being versatility and robustness of the technique, which is capable of analysis of numerous compound groups covering all the main pollutants. This thesis focuses on recent gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry method development in environmental analysis. Samples of air particulate matter and from aqueous environment are covered. Optimization of tandem mass spectrometry parameters, such as excitation energies, the choice of precursor ions and product ions are shown. Tandem mass spectrometry techniques increase sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis by reducing baseline due to specific fragmentation. For the reason of comparison, conventional one dimensional mass spectrometric applications are shown and advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed. Research papers published during past decade were reviewed. Studied material included research results of gas chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry applications for determination of organic compounds, such as endocrine disruptive compounds, organometals, illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, brominated and chlorinated organic compounds, some volatile organic compounds, organonitrogen compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in environmental samples. Sample collection and preparation techniques utilized in applications are reviewed as well. In the experimental part of this study, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry method for the determination of carboxylic acids, phenols and sugars in aerosol particles was developed. The experimental part covers also the study of fatty acids, which are analyzed utilizing the same method. Fatty acids are qualitative trace markers for agriculture based pollution in air. Result of the practical application of fatty acids as <b>trace</b> <b>marker</b> is presented as well. Developed method for determining fatty acids was utilized in field campaign in Bologna, Italy. C 18 /C 16 –ratio is <b>trace</b> <b>marker</b> of agricultural based emission. Campaign results of C 18 /C 16 –ratio and is presented in this thesis. Day-of-week trend of fatty acid emission is covered as well. The utilization of tandem mass spectrometry will reduce common matrix effects of gas chromatography - mass spectrometry and in this way will make analysis more sensitive. Tandem mass spectrometry methods will complete to the requirements of environment monitoring and thus are highly recommended in environmental analysis. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|After {{the mapping}} of genomes and knowing the {{blueprints}} {{of the possible}} gene products, focus is shifting from genomics to proteomics. Proteome analyses {{can be used for}} diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases and for characterization of bioactive compounds and their mechanisms of action. Post-translational modifications, as for example phosphorylations, are important for activity of many bioactive molecules. In paper I, a novel compact disc (CD) based microfluidic method for detection and enrichment of phosphopeptides was tested. Peptides were on-CD processed using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), followed by on-CD MALDI mass spectrometry. In about 200 analyses, with a BSA tryptic peptide background, successful detection of phosphopeptides after IMAC enrichment was achieved in 94 % of the cases. Applied to the ligand-binding domain of the human mineralocorticoid receptor the method identified two novel phosphorylation sites. 2 D-gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) is a well established technique in proteomics. Although with limitations, proteome analysis can supply us with important information on biological materials. Comparisons of patterns in 2 -DE obtained from normal versus specific disease states can be used to <b>trace</b> <b>marker</b> proteins. In paper II, a proteome analysis of Vernix caseosa by 2 -DE and mass spectrometry gave us insight into the role of vernix; we identified 41 proteins of which 25 were novel to vernix and nearly 40 % turned out to have a role in innate immunity. Continuing with 2 D-gel separations whole cell extracts from isolated drug-treated and from native pancreatic rat islets were separated by 2 -DE in paper III. The silver stained gels were scanned, processed by the image analysis tool PDQuest and 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, 15 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated. In paper IV, we directly studied molecular interactions of the insulin releasing imidazoline compound (BL 11282) from paper III using SPR technology and affinity purification with magnetic beads. We identified two proteins binding to the drug, elongation factor 1 alpha and glucose regulated protein 94. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptides and proteins circulate in elevated concentrations. It is estimated that more than 106 different protein components are circulating in the plasma, but a few abundant proteins contribute to 99 % of the protein mass. A multiple affinity removal system was employed in paper V, followed by a workflow including HPLC and SDS-PAGE separation and subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry. We identified 29 proteins present at altered levels in CKD plasma compared to the amounts in plasma from healthy individuals. In paper VI, we again study molecular interactions in relation to diabetes. An oxidative cross linking method was optimized and applied to the proinsulin C-peptide. An interaction partner of biological significance (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B) was identified, and the concept of cross-linking affinity purification, CLAP, was introduced. Proteome analyses include a wide variety of methods. The selection of methods is of great importance for the outcome of proteomic studies, and the need for method development is not expected to cease. In this thesis, a selection of both well established and novel proteomic methods was used to study bioactive molecules...|$|E

50|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} level-set equation, however, requires sophisticated techniques. Simple finite-difference methods fail quickly. Upwinding methods, such as the Godunov method, fare better; however, the level-set method does not guarantee the conservation of the volume and {{the shape of the}} level set in an advection field that does conserve the shape and size, for example, uniform or rotational velocity field. Instead, the shape of the level set may get severely distorted, and the level set may vanish over several time steps. For this reason, high-order finite-difference schemes are generally required, such as high-order essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes, and even then the feasibility of long-time simulations is questionable. Further sophisticated methods to deal with this difficulty have been developed, e.g., combinations of the level-set method with <b>tracing</b> <b>marker</b> particles advected by the velocity field.|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{a chronic}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder that affects almost 1 % {{of the population}} in the age group above 60 years. The key symptom in PD is the restriction of mobility. The progress of PD is typically documented using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which includes a finger-tapping test. We created a measurement tool and a methodology for the objective measurement of the finger-tapping test. We built a contactless three-dimensional (3 D) capture system using two cameras and light-passive (wireless) reflexive markers. We proposed and implemented an algorithm for extracting, matching, and <b>tracing</b> <b>markers.</b> The system provides the 3 D position of spherical or hemispherical markers in real time.

Operando capabilities of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are utilized to study the specially designed single-sided electrochemical cells and to extract detailed information of cell processes.

40|$|The {{ability to}} analyze {{heterogeneous}} rock samples at fine spatial scales {{would represent a}} powerful addition to our planetary in situ analytical toolbox. This is particularly true for Mars, where the signatures of past environments and, potentially, habitability are preserved in chemical and morphological variations across sedimentary layers and among mineral pr. ases in a given rock specimen. On Earth, microbial life often associates with surfaces at the interface of chemical nutrients, and ultimately retains sub-millimeter to millimeter-scale layer confinement in fossilization. On Mars, and possibly other bodies, <b>trace</b> chemical <b>markers</b> (elemental, organic/molecular, isotopic, chiral, etc.) and fine-scale morphological markers (e. g., micro-fossils) may he too subtle, degraded, or ambiguous to be detected, using miniaturized instrumentation, without some concentration or isolation. This is because (i) instrument sensitivity may not be high enough to detect <b>trace</b> <b>markers</b> in bulk averages; and (ii) instrument s~lectiviry may {{not be sufficient to}} distinguish such markers from interfering/counteracting signals from the bulk. Moreover from a fundamental chemostratigraphic perspective there would be a great benefit to assessing specific chemical and stable isotopic gradients, over millimeter-to-centimeter scales and beyond, with higher precision than currently possible in situ. We have developed a precision subsampling system (PSS) that addresses this need while remaining relatively flexible to a variety of instruments that may take advantage of the capability on future missions. The PSS is relevant to a number of possible lander/rover missions, especially Mars Sample Return. Our specific PSS prototype is undergoing testing under Mars ambient conditions, on a variety of natural analog rocks and rock drill cores, using a set of complementary flight-compatible measurement techniques. The system is available for testing with other contact instruments that may benefit from precision sampling...|$|R

We compared the effect of defining marker alleles using either identity by state (IBS) or identity by descent (IBD) on our capacity to <b>trace</b> <b>markers</b> through the pedigree and detect evidence of selection for particular alleles. Allelic identities defined using IBD were much more sensitive for detecting non-Mendelian segregation in this pedigree. Only one marker allele showed significant evidence of selection when IBS was used compared with ten regions with particular allelic identities when IBD was used. Regions under selection were compared with the location of QTLs for agronomic traits known to be under selection in the breeding program. Only two of the ten regions were associated with known QTLs that matched {{with knowledge of the}} agronomic characteristics of the ancestral lines. Some of the other regions were hypothesised to be associated with genes for particular traits based on the properties of the ancestral source lines...|$|R

40|$|Biological fluid {{collection}} {{to identify and}} analyze different disease markers is a routine and normal procedure in health care settings. Body fluids are as varied as urine, blood, mucus, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tears, semen, etc. The volumes of the collected fluids range from micro liters (e. g., tears, CSF) to tens and hundreds of milliliters (blood, urine, etc.). In some manifestations, a disease marker (particularly protein markers) can occur in trace amounts, yet the fluids collected are in large volumes. To identify these <b>trace</b> <b>markers,</b> cumbersome methods, expensive instruments, and trained personnel are required. We developed an easy method to rapidly capture, concentrate, and identify protein markers in large volumes of test fluids. This method involves the utilization of two antibodies recognizing two different epitopes of the protein biomarker. Antibody- 1 helps to capture and concentrate the biomarker and Antibody- 2 adsorbed or conjugated to nanogold beads will detect the biomarker. This method was validated in capturing and detecting lipocalin type prostaglandin-D 2 synthase, a marker in urine that implicates diabetic nephropathy. A one-step collection, concentration, and detection device was designed based on this method. This device can replace many of the normal body fluid collection devices such as tubes and containers. A one-step fluid collection and biomarker capture and concentration device for rapid diagnosis of diseases has tremendous advantage in terms of cost and providing timely results...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} marker-assisted {{selection}} in dairy cattle breeding schemes is predicted by a deterministic model. In these schemes, associations between markers and milk production were assessed from production records of daughters of a grandsire by a multiple regression model with random <b>marker</b> effects. By <b>tracing</b> <b>markers</b> from the grandsire to grandoffspring, deviations of grandoffspring from their full-sib family mean were predicted. Predictions of the within-family variance of the grandoffspring {{accounted for by}} markers amounted to up to 13. 3 %. This figure decreased {{when the number of}} daughters of the grandsire analyzed decreased and, less markedly, when the distance between flanking markers increased. Prediction of within-family deviations hardly improved rates of genetic gain in conventional progeny testing schemes; equal numbers of young bulls were born annually. Genetic gain and improvement of genetic gain because of prediction of within-family deviations were much higher in nucleus schemes. In these schemes, with short optimized generation intervals, conventional selection was mainly for pedigree information and did not use the within-family variance. Analysis of highly polymorphic markers in daughters of both grandsires accounted for 4. 1 to 13. 3 % of the within-family variance, which increased rates of gain by 9. 5 to 25. 8 % and 7. 7 to 22. 4 % in open and closed nucleus schemes, respectively.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in combining EEG and (f) MRI data as they provide complementary information: EEG {{is characterized by a}} high temporal resolution but poor spatial one, while fMRI is characterized by a high spatial resolution but low temporal one. However, while a standard file format for storing EEG data is available since over a decade, it does not fulfill the needs of modern protocols and devices such as those involved in simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. The main reasons are the limited bit resolution, some difficulties encountered in handling and storing acquisition events or <b>trace</b> <b>markers</b> for off-line analyses and the impossibility to add some protocol-specific information that is not considered in the actual data formats. This, among others, hinders the release of free analysis software and makes it difficult to share data across different laboratories as every research unit develops its own tools according to its needs, stores data in proprietary formats and a lot of time is spent building software applications for converting data from one format to another. The NPX (NeuroPhysiological signals in eXtensible Markup Language) data format was defined to overcome these and other limitations, and here its main characteristics are reported as well as how some typical problems occurring in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are also treated.

40|$|We {{describe}} a Markov chain method for sampling from {{the distribution of}} the hidden state sequence in a non-linear dynamical system, given a sequence of observations. This method updates all states in the sequence simultaneously using an embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An update begins with the creation of "pools" of candidate states at each time. We then define an embedded HMM whose states are indexes within these pools. Using a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm, we can efficiently choose a state sequence with the appropriate probabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass through states in these pools. We illustrate the method in a simple one-dimensional example, and in an example showing how an embedded HMM can be used to in effect discretize the state space without any discretization error. We also compare the embedded HMM to a particle smoother on a more substantial problem of inferring human motion from 2 D <b>traces</b> of <b>markers...</b>|$|R

The mixing of the fluid by the reconnection process is demonstrated by <b>tracing</b> passive <b>markers</b> placed initially near the vortex tubes involved in reconnection.

40|$|Panoramic radiographs {{have been}} used for decades in the field of {{dentistry}} and in orthodontics in particular. Panoramic radiography use in orthodontics includes (but is not limited to) : pre-treatment dental assessment, dental age estimation, the detection of dental anomalies, the identification of missing and impacted teeth, the prognosis for unerupted teeth, periodontal tissue assessment and pre-finishing root parallelism. The determination and validity of root position has been debated by many authors and practitioners. Knowledge regarding the production of panoramic radiographs questions whether they are the best way of judging tooth angulation. Aims: The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess dental angulation measurements generated by two panoramic x-ray machines. An attempt would be made to correct appraisal differences and, therefore, render the films more useful in providing the necessary diagnostic information to achieve optimal orthodontic treatment results. Methods: A dry human skull with an inserted typodont was imaged using two different panoramic machines in addition to a CBCT machine. Teeth within the typodont had metal markers attached to their coronal and apical ends. The markers and therefore the long axes of the teeth were identified. Teeth were divided into 5 groups (Anterior-Anterior, Anterior- Premolar, Premolar-Premolar, Premolar-Molar and Molar-Molar). The angles between adjacent teeth were measured on an “OPG extrapolation” produced by <b>tracing</b> <b>markers</b> directly on panoramic radiographs. The same measurements were performed on “Focal Trough Specific extrapolations” which were produced by applying the panoramic machine-specific focal trough around the coordinates of the coronal and apical markers. Each machine had its own “OPG extrapolation” and “Focal Trough Specific extrapolation”. The four extrapolations were compared. Results: A wide range of variation in tooth angulation was found between the measurements of each machine. For the Carestream machine, the Premolar-Molar and Molar-Molar regions were represented poorly on panoramic radiographs. While for the Vatech machine, Premolar- Premolar and Anterior-Premolar were the groups represented least accurately on the panoramic radiographs. Conclusion: Panoramic radiographs should be interpreted with caution when assessing tooth angulations. Panoramic x-ray machine manufacturers should be encouraged to provide a range of error values to help practitioners have a better understanding of the limitations of panoramic radiographic interpretation.

Mixed-ionic-electronic-conducting materials of cerium oxide are used as electrocatalysts.

Electrochemically active region is shown extend 150 - 200 &# 956;m away from current collectors. Foreign elements of silicon and carbon on the electrode are found as excellent <b>trace</b> <b>markers</b> of surface potentials and active region. The observations of transient intermediates (OH - and Ce 3 +) accumulation in the active region on CeO 2 -x electrode allow for identification of the rate-limiting charge transfer process (H 2 O + Ce 3 + &# 8596; Ce 4 + + OH - + H&# 8729;) in both H 2 O electrolysis and H 2 electro-oxidation reactions. The observed potential separation of the adsorbed OH - and incorporated O 2 - ions is interpreted by the effective double layer model and the surface potential step model, which provides insights into the gas-solid interface chemistry. From studies of carbon dioxide electrolysis and carbon monoxide electro-oxidation over CeO 2 -x -based solid oxide electrochemical cells, carbonate are identified as reaction intermediates in both electrochemical reactions. The steady-state concentration increase of CO 3 2 - during CO 2 electrolysis and its slight decrease during CO electro-oxidation on CeO 2 -x electrode suggest the charge transfer process to/from CO 3 2 - is a rate-limiting process. The graphitic carbon formed on the CeO 2 -x electrode surfaces during CO 2 electrolysis extends the electrochemically active region away from the Au electron source by enhancing the electronic conductivity of cerium oxide. Measurements of overpotentials at the electrode-electrolyte interface reveal very high charge transfer resistance at the interface for CO 2 electrolysis that dominates the cell losses in these environments. Mechanistic information extracted from investigating these solid oxide electrochemical cells provides insight into the high temperature surface chemistry on mixed-ionic-electronic-conducting ceria electrodes, and is valuable and guiding {{to the development of}} solid oxide fuel cells due to the similar chemical processes occurring in these electrochemical devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{connecting}} tubule interconnects the nephron {{and collecting}} duct, which arise from kidney mesenchyme and the ureteric bud, respectively, {{to generate the}} functional tubular networks. The collecting duct is comprised of principal cells and intercalated cells, which bear different molecular signatures and regulate sodium/water and acid/base balance, respectively. The progenitor cells of the connecting tubule and the collecting duct remain virtually unknown. We generated two Aqp 2 lineage tracing mouse models. In these models, Aqp 2 Cre transgene drives Cre expression by the Aqp 2 promoter to exclusively either inactivate histone H 3 K 79 methyltransferase Dot 1 l (Dot 1 lf/f Aqp 2 Cre) or activate RFP in Aqp 2 lineage cells during development (Aqp 2 Cre RFP). H 3 K 79 methylation and RFP were used as the <b>tracing</b> <b>markers.</b> Kidney sections were examined by immunofluorescence staining combined with epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Analyses of Dot 1 lf/f Aqp 2 Cre revealed that Dot 1 l ablation abolished H 3 K 79 methylation, which occurs in both principal and intercalated cells. These results suggest that Aqp 2 + progenitor cells give rise to principal cells and intercalated cells {{in the absence of}} Dot 1 l function. With Aqp 2 Cre RFP mice, we not only confirmed that derivation of intercalated cells from Aqp 2 + progenitor cells is not an artifact of Dot 1 l deletion, but also identified the origin and molecular identities of connecting tubules. Aqp 2 + progenitors contribute to renal tubular interconnection by differentiating into various types of transitional cells in the connecting tubule to form three molecularly distinct segments: RFP+Aqp 2 +NCC-, RFP+Aqp 2 -NCC-, and RFP+Aqp 2 -NCC+. RFP+ indicates progenitors of Aqp 2 + origin. Aqp 2 - represents the loss of the original Aqp 2 + progenitors. NCC+is the signature of distal convoluted tubule, the last segment ofnephron linking to the connecting tubule. In summary, our study 1) highlights the molecular identity and the origin of novel and distinct connecting tubule segments; and 2) reveals Aqp 2 + progenitors as the origin of various cell types of connecting tubule as well as collecting duct. Therefore, our study demonstrates novel functions of Aqp 2 +progenitors in the origin of collectingduct and connecting tubule formation. The discovery of the Aqp 2 + progenitor cells may facilitate their further molecular and functional characterization, which is critical for regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|The upper {{member of}} the Nounan Formation and the Worm Creek Member of the St. Charles Formation, both late Cambrian in age, were studied in the Bear River Range and the Fish Creek Range in {{southeast}} Idaho. Lithology and sedimentary structures of these units were compared with characteristics of similar modern sediments and ancient rocks, to determine the environments of deposition and effects of diagenesis for the interval studied. On the basis of widely <b>traced</b> <b>marker</b> horizons, the two-member interval {{is divided into three}} parts, with parts 1 and 2 comprising the upper {{member of the}} Nounan Formation, and part 3 equal to the Worm Creek Member. A marker of mixed-fossil lime packstone at the base of part 1 is overlain by mixed-fossil and lithiclast lime grainstones and cryptalgal boundstones. Sedimentary structures within these units suggest that part 1 was deposited in shallow subtidal and intertidal environments. An oolitic lime and/or dolomite grainstone marks the base of part 2, and suggests shallow subtidal conditions. Part 2 is comprised of interbedded limestones and dolostones, with dolostone becoming predominant up section. The mixed-fossil, oolitic, and lithiclast packstones and grainstones, and cryptalgal boundstones of this part include sedimentary structures which indicate shallow, subtidal accumulation. The percentage of non-carbonate sand increases near the top of part 2, and sedimentary features suggest that water depth decreased slightly as terrigenous influx increased. The base of part 3 (Worm Creek Member) is marked by sandstones and quartzites, cemented with carbonate minerals and/or quartz over-growths. Carbonate deposition resumed above these terrigenous units in the southern and central parts of the study area, while terrigenous sediments continued to accumulate in the north and northwest. This suggests that the source of terrigenous sand was north or northwest of the study area. Radial-fibrous cement rims on carbonate grains indicate early subsea cementation in limestones. Dolomite in 2 ̆ 2 birdseye 2 ̆ 2 structures and in reworked lithiclasts, both in limestones, suggests that a minor amount of syngenetic dolomite formed, although there are no beds of primary dolomite. Dolostone units do not have the sedimentary structures typical of supratidal environments of syngenetic dolomitization, and have the coarsely crystalline texture and other characteristics of secondary dolomite. Dolomitization in a zone of mixing of fresh water and sea water is a probable explanation of all dolostones in the sequence. Dolomite-embayed quartz and feldspar grains and overgrowths in some quartzites of part 3 suggest that dolomitization continued after lithification of some rock units...|$|R
40|$|The lipids {{extracted}} from Cretaceous mudstones {{from the northern}} North Atlantic Ocean (Hole 402 A). The distribution patterns of the π-alkanes, n-fatty acids, and /i-alkan- 2 -ones indicated a predominant al-lochthonous terrigenous origin, with a minor autochthonous marine com-ponent. Molecular markers of both marine and terrestrial origins were identified. The sedimentation took place under oxic conditions with rapid influx of terrigenous detritus. The lipids of an Eocene sample from Site 404 were of a predominantly marine origin with only <b>traces</b> of molecular <b>markers</b> from terrestrial sources. This sediment was deposited in oxic deep waters. The 17 / 3 (H), 21 ß(H) -hopane series was predominant in all these sam-ples, indicating that these sediments are very immature and have had a mild geothermal history...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{medicine}} for complex tissues like limbs {{will require the}} provision or activation of precursors for different cell types, in the correct number, and with the appropriate instructions. These strategies can be guided by what is learned from spectacular events of natural limb or fin regeneration in urodele amphibians and teleost fish. Following zebrafish fin amputation, melanocyte stripes faithfully regenerate in tandem with complex fin structures. Distinct populations of melanocyte precursors emerge and differentiate to pigment regenerating fins, yet the regulation of their proliferation and patterning is incompletely understood. Here, we found that transgenic increases in active Ras dose-dependently hyperpigmented regenerating zebrafish fins. Lineage <b>tracing</b> and <b>marker</b> analysis indicated that increases in active Ras stimulated the in situ amplification of undifferentiated melanocyte precursors expressing mitfa and kita. Active Ras also hyperpigmented early fin regenerates of kita mutants, which are normally devoid of primary regeneration melanocytes, suppressing defects in precursor function and survival. By contrast, this protocol had no noticeable impact on pigmentation by secondary regulatory melanocyte precursors in late-stage kita regenerates. Our results provide evidence that Ras activity levels control the repopulation and expansion of adult melanocyte precursors after tissue loss, enabling the recovery of patterned melanocyte stripes during zebrafish appendage regeneration...|$|R
