40|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is in supply chain management as it promises to provide real-time visibility based on the function of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace.</b> However, such an RFID-based <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> system raises new security and privacy challenges due to the restricted resource of tags. In this paper, we refine three privacy related models (i. e., the privacy, path unlinkability, and tag unlinkability) of RFID-based <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> systems, <b>and</b> clarify the relations among these privacy models. Specifically, we have proven that privacy is equivalent to path unlinkability and tag unlinkability implies privacy. Our results simplify the privacy concept and protocol design for RFID-based <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> systems. Furthermore, we propose an efficient <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> scheme, Tracker+, which allows for authentic and private identification of RFID-tagged objects in supply chains. In the Tracker+, no computational ability is required for tags, {{but only a few}} bytes of storage (such as EPC Class 1 Gen 2 tags) are needed to store the tag state. Indeed, Tracker+ reduces the memory requirements for each tag by one group element compared to the Tracker presented in other literature. Moreover, Tracker+ provides privacy against supply chain inside attacks...|$|R

Visibility and security are critical concerns of the involved prime logistics enterprise and its subcontractors insharing logistics <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> data, which appear fundamentally contracting to each other. Both role-based dataaccessing and sharing mechanism used in traditional databas e management applications and security control solutions based on EPC global infrastructure {{are not able to}} efficiently handle these issues together. In this work, a light-weight privacy protection mechanism is introduced for these enterprises with subcontracting relationships to share logistics <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> data captured with Auto-ID systems equipped with RFID readers, sensors, or global positioning devices. The mechanism consists of a set of protocols designed for the involved stakeholders to register and cancel subcontracting relationship,to set up and clear outsourced logistics job, to upload, update and clear the job data, to track the job execution progress <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> the job execution history. A method for implementing the mechanism is also proposed in this paper, including major use cases, data flow diagrams, and a high-level architecture of a subtracting relationship based <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> management prototype system...|$|R
