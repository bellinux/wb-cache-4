5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured and are <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> {{of choice for}} everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and <b>the</b> <b>onions</b> are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E

Control of <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> crop against <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> thrips is <b>the</b> basis of its protection.

500|$|Conversely, Noel Murray of <b>The</b> <b>Onions</b> The A.V.

Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air.

500|$|Connelly's {{portrayal}} of Sarah polarized critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers. Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly {{is simply the}} wrong person for the right job.

[...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that, [...] "This {{is one of those}} rare horror movies that concentrates on suspense and terror rather than on gore and a high body count."

It includes many that have since become cult classics, like the 1991 Kevin Bacon horror film Tremors, 1999's Office Space and 2000's Boiler Room, all released in late February. They also recommend the January 1993 release Matinee, starring John Goodman as legendary gimmick-using film producer William Castle, and The Pledge, a January 2001 film starring Jack Nicholson.

500|$|Writing for <b>The</b> <b>Onions</b> The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B", {{remarking}} that he [...] "enjoyed the episode overall—largely because it's {{just such a}} treat to have be [...] back in this world with these people—I'm not sure it was wholly successful {{in its attempt to}} play by the old rules." [...] He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia, the episode [...] "settles into a fairly typical" [...] Fringe formula involving a [...] "villain of the week" [...] and a freakish event. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times praised Anna Torv's two performances and believed [...] "the containment built around 'the Machine'" [...] may [...] "have been my favorite part of the episode." ...|$|E

5000|$|In March 2007, <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> {{launched}} <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> News Network, a daily web {{video broadcast}} {{that had been}} in production since sometime in mid-2006. <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> invested about $1 million in production and hired 15 staffers to focus on the venture.

500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of <b>The</b> <b>Onions</b> A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from <b>The</b> <b>Onions</b> The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated {{a real sense of}} Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new place for them to live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E
500|$|House {{received}} largely positive reviews on its debut; {{the series}} was considered a bright spot amid Fox's schedule, {{which at the time}} was largely filled with reality shows. Season one holds a Metacritic score of 75 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews. Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the program was an [...] "uncommon cure for the common medical drama". New York Daily News critic David Bianculli applauded the [...] "high caliber of acting and script". <b>The</b> <b>Onions</b> [...] "A.V. Club" [...] approvingly described it as the [...] "nastiest" [...] black comedy from FOX since 1996's short-lived Profit. New York John Leonard called the series [...] "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic", while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not attempt to hide the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about [...] "HMO factories". Varietys Brian Lowry, less impressed, wrote that the show relied on [...] "by-the-numbers storytelling, albeit in a glossy package". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as [...] "mediocre" [...] and unoriginal.|$|E

5000|$|Reportedly, it was co-founder Chris Johnson's uncle—Nells Johnson—who came up {{with the}} idea to name <b>the</b> paper <b>The</b> <b>Onion.</b> [...] "People always ask {{questions}} about where <b>the</b> name <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> came from", said former President Sean Mills in an interview with Wikinews; [...] "and, when I recently asked (co-founder) Tim Keck, who was one of the founders, he told me...literally that his uncle said he should call it <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> when he saw him and Chris Johnson eating an onion sandwich. They had literally just cut up <b>the</b> <b>onion</b> and put it on bread." [...] According to former editorial manager, Chet Clem, their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions. This account was recently disputed by an editor of <b>The</b> <b>Onion,</b> Cole Bolton, during an event at the University of Chicago. Bolton called Mills's account [...] "the dumbest explanation" [...] and asserted that it is likely wrong. According to Bolton, the most plausible explanation is that <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> was mocking a campus newsletter called The Union.|$|R
