5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso.

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} clarify the pain caused by the bar implant and its {{duration}} after the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum. A semi-structured interview was conducted with eleven mothers and their {{junior high and high}} school children (twenty-two interviewees in total). As a result, the following seven pains and their duration were clarified. (1) Severe pain immediately after surgery and during hospitalization (Ten days after surgery), (2) Pain when changing posture <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (3) Pain caused by restrictions on daily physical activities <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (4) Pain associated with whole-body vibration <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (5) Pain due to upper limb movement <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about six months, (6) Pain due to contact and impact <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about one year, (7) Pain or discomfort due to the bar implant that remains for one year or more, In most of the pain categories, mothers described the duration of pain as being much longer than their children. However, most mothers stated they were satisfied with the results, and that the occurrence of pain does not negate the necessity of this surgery...|$|R

5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice {{and return it to}} the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and {{for a short time}} peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new Superior Court was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton {{was elected}} by the governor's council to head the court, {{defeating}} Danforth by three votes. In early 1693, Danforth sat on Superior Court sessions conducted by Stoughton <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> to hear witchcraft cases, but without accepting spectral evidence. By this time the hysteria was dying down, and the court (sometimes with Danforth leading after Stoughton temporarily removed himself in protest at the ban on spectral evidence and other reforms imposed by Governor Phips. Danforth was sympathetic {{to the plight of}} individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is part of the area where they settled.|$|E

5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Laurer had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged {{for a period}} in 2003, then broke up, and then became engaged again, a pattern <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> {{for the next two}} years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. Eager for a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release. In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman.|$|E

The games created the most accurate and in-depth D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice <b>that</b> <b>continued</b> through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
