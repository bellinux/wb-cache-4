50|$|The Jerusalem {{artichoke}} (Helianthus tuberosus), {{also called}} sunroot, sunchoke, earth apple or <b>topinambour,</b> is {{a species of}} sunflower native to eastern North America, and found from eastern Canada and Maine west to North Dakota, and south to northern Florida and Texas. It is also cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which {{is used as a}} root vegetable.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its name, the Jerusalem {{artichoke}} has {{no relation}} to Jerusalem, {{and it is not}} a type of artichoke, though the two are distantly related as members of the daisy family. The origin of the [...] "Jerusalem" [...] part of the name is uncertain. Italian settlers in the United States called the plant girasole, the Italian word for sunflower, because of its resemblance to the garden sunflower (both plants are members of the genus Helianthus). Over time, the name girasole (pronounced closer to [...] in southern Italian dialects) may have been changed to Jerusalem. [...] In other words, English speakers would have corrupted [...] "girasole artichoke" [...] (meaning, [...] "sunflower artichoke") to Jerusalem artichoke. Another explanation for the name is that the Puritans, when they came to the New World, named the plant with regard to the [...] "New Jerusalem" [...] they believed they were creating in the wilderness. There have also been various other names applied to the plant, such as the French or Canada potato, <b>topinambour,</b> and lambchoke. Sunchoke, a name by which it is still known today, was invented in the 1960s by Frieda Caplan, a produce wholesaler who was trying to revive the plant's appeal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1771 Parmentier won {{an essay}} contest {{in which all}} the judges voted the potato as the best {{substitute}} for regular flour. This was before a time France needed a replacement for wheat, so Parmentier continued to face criticism and lack of acknowledgment for his work. The first step in the acceptance of the potato in French society was a year of bad harvests, 1785, when the scorned potatoes staved off famine in the north of France. In 1789 Parmentier published Treatise on the Culture and Use of the Potato, Sweet Potato, and Jerusalem Artichoke (Traité sur la culture et les usages des Pommes de terre, de la Patate, et du <b>Topinambour),</b> [...] "printed by order of the king", giving royal backing to potato eating, albeit {{on the eve of the}} French Revolution, leaving it up to the Republicans to accept it. In 1794 Madame Mérigot published La Cuisinière Républicaine (The Female Republican Cook), the first potato cookbook, promoting potatoes as food for the common people. The final step may have been the siege of the first Paris Commune in 1795, during which potatoes were grown on a large scale, even in the Tuileries Gardens, to reduce the famine caused by the siege.|$|E
40|$|A <b>topinambour</b> {{collection}} was analyzed {{to determine the}} genetic variability of 141 accessions {{in reaction to the}} length of day (light), its influence on vegetative and flowering phases, tuber number and mass. Day length significantly influenced flowering, which started with the first shorter days (15. 6 h) in the third decade of June, while the majority of accessions flowered in the third decade of August (13. 3 h). Differences between accessions were statistically significant for the analyzed phenotype traits. A significantly longer vegetative phase was found in Montenegrin accessions in comparison to the other groups of origin. Duration of the vegetative phase was significantly and positively correlated to tuber mass and negatively to their number, while duration of the reproductive phase had an opposite effect. For further work on <b>topinambour</b> breeding, it would be important to describe the mechanism of photoperiodic control of flowering initialization. Only by obtaining accessions neutral to the photoperiod could <b>topinambour</b> become a cultivated crop...|$|E
40|$|EGA-MS (evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry) and Py(HMDS) -GC/MS (pyrolysis-gas {{chromatography}} {{coupled with}} mass spectrometry with in situ derivatisation using hexamethyldisilazane as a silylating agent) {{were used to}} study the behaviour under pyrolytic conditions of fructose, inulin and <b>topinambour</b> (Jerusalem artichoke), a tuber, in which inulin coexists with other organic and inorganic species. The aim was to acquire a complete picture of the chemical characteristics and reactivity of fructose and its polymers (fructans). In fact, fructans constitute the reserve carbohydrates of several botanical species and are important substrates for obtaining high value-added products. EGA-MS of inulin and <b>topinambour</b> provided information on their different thermal and chemical complexities. Despite tuber being constituted mostly by inulin, its thermogram was much more complex than obtained for inulin alone. The EGA curve of <b>topinambour</b> extended for a wider temperature range and provided mass spectra containing several peaks related to the fragmentation of compounds different from those obtained {{in the analysis of}} inulin. The evolution of levoglucosan clearly indicates the presence of glucose units in the tuber. The pyrolysis of fructose and inulin carried out by Py-GC/MS generated a high number of pyrolysis products, the main ones being dihydroxyacetone, 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde, and 2, 6 -anhydrofructofuranose. The similarity between the two pyrograms suggests that under pyrolysis conditions, one of the first reactions of inulin is the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. An important difference was obtained in the pyrolysis of inulin alone, which {{led to the formation of}} di-fructose dianhydrides. A different quali-quantitative distribution of the pyrolysis products was obtained for <b>topinambour</b> likely due to the different monosaccharides in the <b>topinambour</b> composition from fructose, as well as to the presence of significant amounts of inorganics...|$|E
40|$|<b>Topinambour</b> is a {{perennial}} species originating from {{central part of}} North America. This species {{is known to be}} a potential source of resistance to some diseases of cultivated sunflower like stem canker. In this research we evaluated 141 populations of Helianthus tuberosus from the collection of Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad. Plants in the collection field and in the experimental field were artificially inoculated using Phomopsis helianthi isolate from Rimski Šančevi. After seven days of growing on PDA (Potato-Dextrose Agar) medium, mycelial plugs were placed on leaf tip and wrapped with aluminum foil. Disease progress was measured in regular intervals. Occurrence of natural infections was also evaluated and all diseases were noted. As a result of this survey significant differences were detected among populations regarding disease intensity. Out of all assessed populations those labeled as TUB 2046, TUB 2062 and TUB CG 65 were most resistant...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the feasibility of}} agricultural crop residues used as alternative raw materials for particle boards was investigated. Germany-grown cup-plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.), sunflower (Helianthusannuus L.) and <b>topinambour</b> (Helianthus tuberosus L.) were used as raw materials for particleboards produced at a conventional density of 600 kg/m 3. Particleboards were glued with two different adhesives, with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as well and urea formaldehyde (UF) resins. The physical and mechanical properties of prepared panels were measured according to standards. The raw materials were analyzed for their chemical composition; particle geometry was carefully monitored. It is shown that the obtained particleboards have acceptable performances, though properties were below those obtained from conventional spruce particleboards. Modulus of rupture of the alternative material particleboards {{were found to be}} lower than the spruce particleboards. Likewise, thickness swelling and water absorption of the agricultural residues made particleboards were higher than the compared spruce-made particleboards. The finding relevant for industrial applications was that the agricultural residue-produced particleboards bonded with MDI resins fully comply with the European standard EN 312 class P 1 (use in dry conditions). This means that non-wood particleboards are suitable to be used in furniture production...|$|E
40|$|Liquid fuels (bioethanol and biooil) {{derived from}} {{herbaceous}} crops are considered beneficial {{for the environment}} and human health {{especially if they are}} used as fuels for motor vehicles, The choice of the most suited crop to be cultivated for liquid biofuel production depends on many factors; the most important being the economic convenience for farmers to cultivate the new energy crop in place of the traditional ones (for example, wheat). In order to analyse the conditions which favour the cultivation and selling of specific energy crops, a simple methodology is proposed, based on the calculation of the “threshold price ” of the energy crop products The “threshold price ” is the minimum price at which the primary products of the energy crop, i. e. : roots, tubers, seeds etc., must be sold in order to obtain a gross margin equal to that usually obtained from the traditional crop which has to be replaced by the energy crop. As a case-study, this methodology has been applied to twelve Italian provinces where the cultivation of six energy crops, both in productive lands and set-aside lands, is examined. The crops considered are sugar beet, sweet sorghum and <b>topinambour</b> useful for bioethanol production; and rapeseed, sunflower and soya, which are usually employed for the production of biooil...|$|E
40|$|The Jerusalem {{artichoke}} (Helianthus tuberosus L.) known also as <b>topinambour</b> is {{plant with}} high importance for {{human and animal}} nutrition during the last decade. Its tubers were consumed fresh, stewed or they were added as flour in food products to improve their functional properties. In the current research a comparative study of bioactive substance and free radical scavenging activities of flour obtained from tubers of different varieties and wild populations of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) grown on territory of Bulgaria was done. The ultrasonic irradiation (42 kHz) was performed with 70 % ethanol and distilled water as solvents to accelerate extraction process. The total fructans, phenolic content and radical scavenging activities of the extracts were investigated. The 70 % ethanol extracts possessed the highest total phenolic content (6 - 17 mg GAE/g dry weight) and antioxidant activity defined by ABTS and CUPRAC methods. The water extracts characterized with higher fructan levels- 32 to 69 g/ 100 g dry weight. The flour obtained from tubers of Scorospelcu variety and wild population of Helianthus tuberosus L. were evaluated as a valuable source of total polyphenols and soluble dietary fibers, because of the rich fructan content. The results from our study also revealed the potential application of these flours as radical scavengers in human and animal nutrition for preparation of foods with improve health benefits...|$|E
