With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces {{he is looking for}} a new dancer to portray the dual role of the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. Nina auditions for the role and gives a flawless performance as the White Swan, but fails <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> Black Swan.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Baysdorfer provided Omaha {{with another}} invention by successfully flying an airship {{in the city}} in 1889. In 1929 a bond was passed that would construct the Omaha Municipal Airport in East Omaha. This was thought <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> city's hope for the future; however, air travel did not become popular in Omaha until the 1960s. The land was swampy {{and had to be}} filled in with silt taken from the bottom of Carter Lake. Northwest Airlines started service between Minneapolis and Omaha in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} Olympics mascot was Waldi, introduced at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Games mascots have varied between being animals {{native to the}} area where the Games take place, humans, and imaginary creatures. They often reflect the culture and history of the hosting region, and have traits chosen <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> ideals of Olympism and the Paralympic movement. The introduction of a mascot or mascots is often highlighted in the lead-up to the Games, to help build event anticipation, with a focus placed on them in contemporary Olympics. The first ever Summer Youth Olympics, Singapore's organizing committee extended the tradition of having mascots to this new event.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E

5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight {{can also be seen}} as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E

25|$|The {{compound}} Ianus Quirinus is to {{be found}} also in the rite of the spolia opima, a lex regia ascribed to Numa, which prescribed that the third rank spoils of a king or chief killed in battle, those conquered by a common soldier, be consecrated to Ianus Quirinus.

25|$|French {{philosophers}} {{produced some}} of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau openly criticised the European divine right monarchies and strongly affirmed the principle of the sovereignty of the people. Voltaire came <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|In the world's centre is a {{tree of life}} (the yaxche 'ceiba') {{that serves}} as a means of {{communication}} between the various spheres. In Palenque, the tree of life is a maize tree, just as the central world tree in the Borgia Codex; a curving bicephalic serpent hovers around it, which some believe <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic. The king was probably identified with the tree of the centre and is usually shown to carry the bicephalic serpent as a ceremonial bar. Besides worshipping a central maize tree, the king commonly sits or stands on a mountain containing the maize, perhaps as a guardian of the kingdom's maize supplies.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} psychological {{affect on}} Hilde was the coercion <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> patriarchal fascist belief {{system of the}} time and to inculcate it into her own personal identity. She was made to feel inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of thinking. As an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, section 3(1)(e) {{differs from}} the classic common law idea of sedition {{because there is no}} {{requirement}} that the seditious tendency has to be directed against the maintenance of government. A District Court held in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong (2009) that on a plain and literal reading, there is no suggestion that Parliament intended <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> common law of seditious libel into section 3(1)(e). Since prosecutions under the Sedition Act since 1966 have been based on section 3(1)(e), a distinctive feature of the use of the Act in the 21st century is that it has primarily been employed to deal with disruptions to racial and religious harmony.|$|E
25|$|The {{colonisation}} of South Australia was {{a project}} of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who believed {{that many of the}} social problems in Britain were caused by overcrowding and overpopulation. In 1832 Rowland Hill published a tract called Home colonies : sketch of a plan for the gradual extinction of pauperism, and for the diminution of crime, based on a Dutch model. Hill then served from 1833 until 1839 as secretary of the South Australian Colonization Commission, which worked successfully to establish a settlement without convicts at what is today Adelaide. The political economist, Robert Torrens was chairman of the Commission. Under the South Australia Act 1834, the colony was <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> ideals and best qualities of British society, shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to social progress and civil liberties. Rowland Hill's sister Caroline Clark, husband Francis and their large family were to migrate to South Australia in 1850.|$|E

25|$|The Ahmadiyya {{movement}} {{was founded in}} 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. He {{claimed to be the}} promised messiah and mahdi awaited by the Muslims and obtained a considerable number of followers initially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh. Ahmadis claim the Ahmadiyya movement <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> latter day revival of Islam and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century India. After the death of Ghulam Ahmad, his successors directed the Ahmadiyya Community from Qadian which remained the headquarters of the community until 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. The movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream Muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to Ghulam Ahmad's claim to be a prophet within Islam.|$|E
25|$|Verse Draft (Erstschrift des Textbuches) – a {{first draft}} of the final libretto, written in an archaic form of German alliterative verse known as Stabreim. Wagner created his verse drafts by versifying the {{dialogue}} already contained in his prose drafts – turning prose into poetry – or by creating new verse to replace those sections of the prose drafts {{for which he had}} not yet sketched any dialogue. He also added new elements not present in the prose drafts. For instance, the symbolic use of Wotan's spear and its engraved runes <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> rule of law is not present in the prose draft of Das Rheingold: this idea only came to Wagner while he was working on the verse draft of Die Walküre. It was also while developing the latter that he first thought of making Loge a god of fire: in the prose draft of Das Rheingold he is merely a trickster and teller of unwelcome truths. While writing his verse drafts, Wagner also greatly expanded his stage directions (which, of course, were always in prose).|$|E
25|$|In Japanese culture, the boar {{is widely}} seen as a fearsome and {{reckless}} animal, {{to the point that}} several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said <b>to</b> <b>embody</b> <b>the</b> boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar's courage and defiance is a source of admiration, and {{it is not uncommon for}} hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boarhunting. The animal's link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period, and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his wallet.|$|E
