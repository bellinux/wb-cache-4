5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant.

5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots {{are located in the}} vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the good of Texas.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the only}} thing to add to Deborah Martell’s {{description}} was that the MRT supported the easy transmission of collected data through telephone lines using a portable modem which, at the time, was cutting edge technology. To put these developments into context, the Internet was only commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET was decommissioned and the last barriers <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> commercial purposes were removed (so the Ferranti MRT was in use for over 10 years before the commercial Internet).|$|R

5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, the {{committee}} from the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Society asked {{to use the}} building when {{it was not in}} use for discharged female convicts from the prison at Carliol Square (1828–1925) to do laundry work and the Society continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> this purpose until the turn of the century. Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built over the front lawn of the Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The GDR emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated {{in part to the}} 1920s. Access also needed to be provided for the handicapped.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the State of California {{declared}} the reservoir unsafe {{in the event}} of an earthquake. Rather than perform a seismic retrofit of the dam, the City decided <b>to</b> stop <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> water supply.|$|R
50|$|The USAAC {{was also}} {{interested}} in the H-2470, and installed and flew it in the Vultee XP-54 prototype fighter. The XP-54 was the only aircraft <b>to</b> actually <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> flight, but like the Navy's XF-14C, the XP-54 never went into production.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was sold to}} the City of Liberty in 2001. Although renovations on its interior began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as <b>for</b> municipal offices, the project was abandoned. In 2002, it was leased to Liberty Baptist Church for a youth activity center.|$|R
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for.</b> When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
5|$|The ruins were {{described}} by Guatemalan historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in 1695. Miguel Rivera Maestre published some plans {{and views of}} the ruins in 1834 in his Atlas del Estado de Guatemala ("Atlas of the State of Guatemala"). American diplomat and writer John Lloyd Stephens described the ruins, which he called Patinamit, after he visited Iximche with English artist Frederick Catherwood and in 1840. Catherwood never published any drawings of the site and Stephens reported that the locals had plundered the stone at the site {{for many years in}} order <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> building materials in Tecpán. French architect Cesar Daly mapped Iximche in 1857.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 80s he experimented with the {{computer}} as a compositional aid, but quickly shifted <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> realtime music interaction, producing pieces such as Timid Souls (1989/90) and Incrustations (1994). In the early 90s he developed his current compositional technique of ‘intuitive constructivism’ where short, intense time-spans of sonic conception allows for unencumbered composing that by nature preclude any subsequent revisions. The first works with this method were River and Leaf (1991/92), The Circle And The Web (1992) and the orchestra work Sated Bodies (1993/94), whereas emphasis on pulsations combined with time-bound elasticity that harks back to his musical initiation in the 70s became apparent {{for the first time}} in Black Walls (1995).|$|R
5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> his own purposes, {{as happened in}} 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing {{the rest of their}} possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but {{as soon as he was}} freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the weekend.|$|E
5|$|Square trademarked Seiken Densetsu in , {{intending}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a game project subtitled The Emergence of Excalibur, {{and led by}} Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According {{to early}} advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, {{making it one of}} the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: Final Fantasy.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E

30|$|In {{the final}} {{component}} of our analysis, we switch {{from using the}} experimental program group data to test the model <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> help calibrate the model. This switch embodies in our context the very general tradeoff between using additional restrictions for testing versus using them for calibration or estimation. For example, in a common effects linear instrumental variables context, a researcher with two candidate instrumental variables must choose between using both for estimation, or <b>using</b> one <b>to</b> test the exogeneity of the other. A natural approach within our framework starts with using the experimental variation to test the model and then switches <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> estimation or calibration once a satisfactory model is found. In the SSP context, using the experimental program group in the calibration changes the results in New Brunswick but not in British Columbia.|$|R
