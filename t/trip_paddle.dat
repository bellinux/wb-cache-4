50|$|Richmond or Twickenham long {{remained}} the practical upper limit of steamboats on the Thames, though the competition through London was keen, with the fare dropping to 1/2d each way on shorter <b>trips.</b> <b>Paddle</b> Steamers {{found it difficult}} to pass through the narrow locks and as late as 1843, steam boats were prohibited from passing Teddington Lock and those they could found much of the river too full of weed. It took the Thames Conservancy until 1877 to clear it before screw steamers became a practical proposition, when a service started between Hampton Court and Staines using the Runnymede. In 1878 the Thames and Isis Steamboat Company started a service between Kingston and Oxford with Isis taking 3 days. In 1888 Salter Bros established a rival service using the steam boat Alaska, and have retained an important role on the river ever since.|$|R

50|$|There {{were four}} major routes by sea: paddle steamer (or {{occasionally}} sailing ship) {{to the future}} countries of Panama, Nicaragua or Mexico, a trip across land to the Pacific and then a <b>trip</b> by <b>paddle</b> steamer to California. These routes were used by travelers who could afford them being the fastest—about 40-60 days. The other major sea route was by sea around Cape Horn or the Magellan Straits and on to California—this trip typically took over 200 days and was the main shipping route for merchandise. Most of those traveling by ship lived on the Eastern seaboard and were acquainted with sea borne commerce and travel.|$|R
60|$|As for King William Island, the Makambo, on {{the former}} run of the Cockspur, stopped there every ten weeks; but the direst threat Daughtry ever held over him was the putting ashore of him {{at the place where}} the two active young men still mourned their pig. In fact, it was their regular programme, each <b>trip,</b> to <b>paddle</b> out and around the Makambo and make ferocious grimaces up at Kwaque, who grimaced back at them from over the rail. Daughtry even {{encouraged}} this exchange of facial amenities for the purpose of deterring him from ever hoping to win ashore to the village of his birth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trips</b> by <b>paddle</b> wheel {{steamship}} to Panama and Nicaragua from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, via New Orleans and Havana {{were about}} 2600 mi long and took about two weeks. Trips across the Isthmus of Panama or Nicaragua typically took about one week by native canoe and mule back. The 4000 mi trip {{to or from}} San Francisco to Panama City could be done by paddle wheel steamer in about three weeks. In addition to this travel time via the Panama route typically had a two- to four-week waiting period to find a ship going from Panama City, Panama to San Francisco before 1850. It was 1850 before enough paddle wheel steamers were available in the Atlantic and Pacific routes to establish regularly scheduled journeys.|$|R

50|$|Everybody {{who attends}} Pine Crest {{goes on a}} canoe trip in his/her session. The length of trips varies by session length, program, and age. Younger campers tend to go on two- or three-day outtrips to the campsites on the three lakes that {{surround}} camp (Clear Lake, Gullwing Lake and Echo Lake) while older campers go on four- or five-day trips. Campers who attend for a full month go on six- or eight-day trips, while the Junior Leaders-in-Training and Leaders-in-Training go on eight- and ten-day <b>paddling</b> <b>trips,</b> respectively, and two- and four-day hikes, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The first {{seagoing}} <b>trip</b> of a <b>paddle</b> steamer {{was by the}} Albany in 1808. It steamed {{from the}} Hudson River along the coast to the Delaware River. This was purely {{for the purpose of}} moving a river-boat to a new market, but paddle-steamers began regular short coastal trips soon after. In 1816 Pierre Andriel, a French businessman, bought in London the 15 HP paddle steamer Margery (later renamed Elise) and made an eventful London-Le Havre-Paris crossing, encountering heavy weather on the way. He later operated his ship as a river packet on the Seine, between Paris and Le Havre.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many miles of river {{suitable}} for flatwater boating in the downstream sections {{of both the}} mainstem Eel and the South Fork. Humboldt Redwoods State Park leads <b>paddle</b> <b>trips</b> along that stretch of the river. There is good fishing for Chinook salmon and steelhead in the lower river, and rainbow trout are found above Lake Pillsbury. Introduced pikeminnow, {{in conjunction with the}} diminished flows due to the Potter Valley Project water diversion, have taken a significant toll on the native fish population below Van Arsdale Dam. The river can be closed to fishing in some years after October 1 if flows are insufficient for migrating salmon and steelhead.|$|R
5000|$|The name Ganargua {{has been}} {{translated}} as [...] "where the village sprang up" [...] or [...] "a village suddenly sprang up", {{and the name}} was given to by the creek by the region's original Iroquois inhabitants. The nickname of 'Mud Creek' is given due to the murkiness of the water. Ganargua Creek is a primary spot for fishing, canoeing and kayaking. Even though a channel has been cut through the foliage, <b>paddling</b> <b>trips</b> on the creek can be difficult due {{to a number of}} log jams from fallen trees as a result of ice storms which hit the greater Rochester area in 1991 and 2003.|$|R

5000|$|In a canoe the paddler kneels on {{one knee}} with the other leg forward and foot {{flat on the floor}} of the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only with what is known as a 'J-stroke' to control the boat's direction. In Canada, a racing class exists for the C-15 or WC or [...] "War Canoe", as well as a {{similarly}} designed C-4 (which is much shorter and more squat than an 'International' C-4). An antiquated boat class is the C-7, resembling a large C4 which was debuted by the ICF with little success. For racing canoes, the blade is typically short and broad, with a 'power face' on one side that is either flat or scalloped out. The shaft will typically be longer than a <b>tripping</b> canoe <b>paddle,</b> because the kneeling position puts the paddler higher above the surface of the water. More recent designs of canoe racing paddles often have a slight bent shaft, commonly 12-14 degrees. (a concept of canoe designer Eugene Jensen in the 1960s). Many high-performance canoe paddlers prefer the feel of a wooden handle with a carbon fiber shaft and blade, while nearly all high-performance kayak paddlers use paddles made completely of carbon fiber.|$|R
50|$|A <b>paddling</b> <b>trip</b> usually {{done by a}} group {{where they}} will descend a {{technical}} creek {{over a period of}} days. The group will usually survive on supplies they begin the trip with stored in their creek boats. The level of difficulty in creeking makes packing for overnight trips especially challenging as adding weight to the kayak can severely hamper the performance of the kayak, whereas canoes do not usually have as much of a problem. The placement of the gear within the kayak also impacts the performance of the boat as the center of gravity moves. Essential gear for multi-day trips includes fire starting gear, food and/or fishing line, and warm gear or a sleeping bag for the nights. Tents, sleeping pads, and cooking equipment are optional based on weight and space. This activity is comparable to mountaineering in scale and exposure, and mountaineering grade equipment is favored for its weight characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first person}} to set foot in Mattis Point was Mattis Alexander.Mattis Alexander was born on a ship coming across the Atlantic Ocean.The ship {{was coming from the}} Hebrides islands.

Mattis met and fell in love with Tara Gunshoe, the daughter of a famous blacksmith Willy Gunshoe. They moved to the Woodland and lived there for the rest of their lives. With Mattis and Tara living on the highest part of it,seen from across the bay, the nickname Mattis Point started up because Mattis lived on the point (Mattis Point). One late night around Christmas 1514 the Alexander home caught fire and it is believed that Mattis and Tara both died in the blaze. Mattis Point then had a population of 8 families thanks to the Alexanders. Mattis was then known in history as the first Mattis Pointer. And now years and years after Mattis Point is still here and it is the best place to live in because of its location and friendly people.|$|R
40|$|This paper 2 ̆ 7 s {{contribution}} {{to the understanding of}} outdoor recreational pursuits in Ireland comes from the estimation of the first whitewater kayaking demand function. This paper is also unique in that it combines data collected from two different sources; the internet and an on-site survey, thus alleviating the problem of endogenenous stratification that is found when carrying out on-site surveys alone. The Travel Cost Model (TCM) method of estimation is used to put a value on the demand for whitewater recreation on the Roughty river, Co. Kerry, Ireland. Whitewater kayaking is well suited for the use of TCM to estimate recreational values as it is conducted at distinct, identifiable sites, and most <b>paddling</b> <b>trips</b> are single purpose, taken {{for the sole purpose of}} recreation at the site (English and Bowker, 1996). With regard to the estimation of our travel cost model, the study found that the mean willingness to pay (i. e. the consumer surplus + travel cost) of the average kayaker using the Roughty river in Co. Kerry was 194 Euro per trip. This result is conditional on the survey sample but still indicates the high value of the Roughty river as a whitewater recreational resource...|$|R
40|$|MANY {{investigators}} have sought a i practical and accurate method to record time of lay of fowl. Early investiga-tors {{found it necessary}} to visit the cage or nest frequently to record time of oviposi-tion. Their data may have been sufficiently accurate for the period under observation; however, it failed to describe the actual pattern of oviposition throughout the 24 -hour period of the day. In recent years various types of auto-matic timing systems have been cited in the literature. The recording devices gener-ally consist of two functional components —a recording instrument, and a switch lo-cated {{at the front of the}} cage which opens and closes a circuit when activated by a rolling egg. For simplicity, the latter com-ponent will be referred to as a circuit breaker "trip. " • A design for recording time of lay was described by Hinds (1949). He used an individual hen battery with a modified cage floor, and an end receptacle for the egg. The floor was slanted 30 ° to permit the egg to roll immediately to the front of the cage. Before entering the tray, each egg <b>tripped</b> a hinged <b>paddle</b> that subse-quently closed two exposed electrical con-tact points. This set up a magnetic field which pulled a writing arm into contact with a magnet where it was held until the egg passed. On release, the writing arm re-bounded against the kymograph, thus re...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Over the years, {{there has}} been an {{environmental}} movement nationwide, particularly in urban areas, with an increased attention on water health and greening cities with trees and open spaces. Public programs such as parks and recreation have long histories in making a conscious effort to better protect and improve environment quality and access. Water in urban areas is gaining attention particularly by non-motorized recreationists and public recreation providers by forming water or blue trails. Increased participation in water sports, such as canoeing and kayaking, has created a greater demand for recreation opportunities (Uunila 2 ̆ 6 Currie, 1999). This research study profiles paddle participants who utilized urban water trails in the Detroit metropolitan area. The study was based on paddlers who use electronic or web-based information to stay connected to the paddling community and recreation opportunities. Listserv registrants were studied as a form of viral marketing. Facebook members were studied to understand the influence of social media on paddling activities and social connectivity. Paddlers who were on a Listserv were more likely to respond to the survey, on average to be over 50 years old, were more familiar with paddling programs sponsored by a local retail store, and were more likely to plan future day <b>paddling</b> <b>trips</b> by researching online, compared to Facebook members.

5000|$|A popular {{concept of}} the California Gold Rush portrays the {{overland}} migration coming by wagon, yet according to the evidence, more people journeyed by sea. A typical wagon journey took about 140 days while a voyage by paddle wheel steamer, a short land <b>trip</b> and another <b>paddle</b> wheel steamer {{could be done in}} as short as 40 days over the Isthmus of Panama or Nicaragua route once the shipping lines were established in about 1850. Before farms could be set up, cities and industries built, etc. an early maritime traffic in passengers, food, lumber and building supplies were established with Pacific rim countries like Chile, Mexico, Hawaii and the future state of Oregon. Tools, clothing, and everything needed for an 1850 standard of living for miners and an expanding population would in most cases have to initially be imported from the East coast of the United States or Europe. Sea transport was about the only way cargo of any kind could be delivered to California. High value cargo like gold and passengers usually went by the Panama or Nicaragua route. Bulkier, lower value cargo, usually went by sailing ship around Cape Horn. A standard sailing ship took an average of about 200 days to go this route while the faster Clipper ships averaged about 140 days. Carrying any significant amount of goods cross country by wagon over 2000 mi of bad road was a slow, costly process that was seldom done. Not until the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 was there any easy way to move cargo across land to California. Even today, bulky or heavy cargo is usually sent by ship because it is cheap and efficient, though slower than other methods.(Note: Paddle wheel steamers did not reach California by sea until long after the gold [...] "rush" [...] had ended. See later in this article for the date which was long after the [...] "rush") ...|$|R
