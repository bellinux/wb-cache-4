40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to study the}} self-presentation habits of Facebook users, and to assess how conscious of these habits the users are. In addition, the effect of other Facebook users on the self-presentation process of an individual user was studied. The empirical {{data for this study}} was collected via an online survey. The survey was distributed through Facebook in February 2017 and it received a total of 84 responses. The majority of the respondents were from Finland, and among 25 - 44 years of age. The quantitative data was analyzed by examining the answer percentages and averages, and qualitative data by content analysis. For the data analysis, the ideas of symbolic interactionism were applied. As a key finding, {{the results of this study}} indicated that self-presentation on Facebook is a conscious action and that people spend time controlling their Facebook presence. Most of the actions are performed on purpose, and the respondents of the survey had clear ideas of the actions they want and do not want to execute on Facebook. The results also suggest that it is important to present oneself in a favorable way and that the users are trying to idealize the presentation of self. Clearly, the respondents neither want to look bad or feel embarrassed on Facebook. They also described how they tend to leave things out because they do not want to be associated with certain subjects, matters or people. The influence of other users was clearly noticed, and was indicated to have both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> other users were not appreciated if they presented the affected user in an undesirable way. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> other users made the respondents feel happy and a sense of belonging to a group. Other Facebook users are perceived as an audience, and the respondents paid more attention to the content they post depending on who the recipients are.

Several {{studies have shown that}} for the {{isolated}} and mentally ill, the Web and social media provide effective platforms for supports and treatments as well as to acquire scientific, clinical understanding of this mental condition. More and more individuals affected by depression join online communities to seek for information, express themselves, share their concerns and look for supports [12]. For the first time, we collect and study a large online depression community of more than 12, 000 active members from Live Journal. We examine the effect of mood, social connectivity and age on the online messages authored by members in an online depression community. The posts are considered in two aspects: what is written (topic) and how it is written (language style). We use statistical and machine learning methods to discriminate <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> bloggers in low versus high valence mood, in different age categories and in different degrees of social connectivity. Using statistical tests, language styles are found to be significantly different between low and high valence cohorts, whilst topics are significantly different between people whose different degrees of social connectivity. High performance is achieved for low versus high valence post classification using writing style as features. The finding suggests the potential of using social media in depression screening, especially in online setting...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to study how public television uses Facebook to involve their viewers. In the theoretical study of the thesis I included {{a report of the}} reference system – democratic society, participation and participatory democracy, the relationship between the democracy and the media, digital participatory democracy, information society, social networking and the challenges of the public broadcasting in the context of new media. Concisely, the public broadcasting networks in democracy serve the interest of the general public and are subject to public control. Meanwhile the public broadcasting network has lost much of its former identity in the last few decades and has to go forward with a swift and inevitable reformation in these changing times. It is the premise of its survival. First and foremost the public broadcasting must become the public media. This implies the diverse utilization of media platforms – the production and distribution of new public content is important on these new platforms. On the other hand – if the public institution looses touch with the general public, its content has no consumers – no matter the platform. It is essential to preserve (if necessary, to establish) and nurture communication with the public. In contemporary times the public has moved to and is accessible via the Internet. That is why the strategy aimed at the user of the public media must encompass different platforms, social networks among others. Because Estonia's (and {{the better part of the}} world's) most popular social network is Facebook (FB), I studied the activity of the broadcasting networks on FB, and, to be more specific, how they involve their fans. For this purpose I observed in empirical study the posts on the FB Page of six (almost) daily live shows during the period of one month (1. September - 1. October). The selected public institutions are BBC (United Kingdom and Northern Ireland), YLE (The republic of Finland), and ERR (The Republic of Estonia). BBC is worlds most recognized and oldest public media enterprise. YLE is the medium of Nordic culture and the bearer of strong public broadcasting tradition; in addition it is comparable and understandable to the Estonian cultural background. ERR is the Estonian Public Broadcasting corporation. The select shows are the morning newsmagazines (Terevisioon, Aamu TV, The Breakfast) and the evening entertainment talk shows (Ringvaade, Puoli seitsemän – Ps, The One Show). I searched for answers to the following questions: 1. What is the purpose of the show's FB page 2. Does the crew of the show look for contact with the viewer, do they try to involve the fan 3. What are the practices of communication with the viewers through FB for different countries and where in the comparison stands ERR 4. How to measure success communicating with the FB community (the count of the responses, the increase of the ratings or the formation of a loyal community) For the method I chose content analysis, which in my opinion applies best to the study of <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> different editorial boards and the their friends or fans. In the result two strategies differentiated. The morning and evening program of BBC and YLE are stylistically so alike (the editorial board uses similar strategies inside the organization), that it is plausible to speculate the existence of a social network strategy on the organizational level. Both of these institutions value the inclusion of the viewer, but execute it in a different manner. BBC is more conservative and official, YLE on the contrary uses more informal language and warm personal attitude. Both of them have an active fan base, in case of YLE the activity of the fans is comparatively larger (% of the fan count). ERR lacks a general strategy for the use of the social network on an organizational level. First and foremost it seems to serve the means of marketing – a way to spread information. Still both of the ERR’s shows examined have acquired a loyal fan base, that has occasionally revealed its potential, which they have not known how or have not been able to harness in its full capacity. An interesting outcome appeared analyzing the accordance of the FB content and the reactions. Namely it became obvious, that the editorial boards contribute most vigorously posting the introduction to the shows and it does not merit enough interest from the fan base. Considerably less attention is focused on personal approach, where actually lies the fan base's readiness to react. It must be noted that in case of all the FB pages, the editorial boards do not use the potential of FB. The platform offers in addition to posting messages, pictures/videos the compilation of questionnaires, the organization of small sub communities and much more...|$|E

40|$|Social status can be {{reflected}} in many aspects of an individual's behaviour and ecology, including habitat use and conspecific interactions. In territorial species where at least two social groups - breeding birds and non-territorial floaters - are recognized, the diverse tasks associated with territorial ownership can lead territory holders to behave differently from the non-territorial part of the population. Territory holders defend their breeding area and reproduce, whereas floating individuals are dispersing and lead a more transient life, during which they do not show any territorial behaviour even when settling in {{a more or less}} fixed area (known as the stop phase). As social interactions are based on visual and vocal cues, the use of specific sites for sending and/or receiving signals can be a crucial choice in an animal's life. By analysing the post-site selection of Eagle Owl Bubo bubo breeders and floaters during their nocturnal activity, we found that: (1) territory holders selected more visible and dominant posts than non-territorial floaters; (2) <b>the</b> choice of <b>posts</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> floating individuals did not differ between the wandering and stop phases of dispersal; and (3) floating females intruded more frequently than floating males within a breeder's home-range. These findings highlight the fact that two social strategies are possible within the same species, depending on an individual's social status and its related tasks. Breeders could take advantage of visible locations to declare their status as territory holders, whereas floaters could benefit from a more secretive life to wander unnoticed among occupied territories. This secretive life would help floaters to reduce the risks associated with conspecific aggression. Finally, the greater occurrence of floating females within breeders' home-ranges {{can be explained by the}} fact that female incursions in a breeder's home-range are less risky than male intrusions. © 2010 The Authors.
