5|$|Triceratops {{was one of}} {{the last}} ceratopsian genera to appear before the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event. The related Torosaurus, and the more distantly related diminutive Leptoceratops, were also present, <b>though</b> <b>their</b> remains have been rarely encountered.|$|E
5|$|Although the s were a {{significant}} improvement from the preceding , especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by {{the advent of the}} dreadnought well before they were completed.

5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. <b>Though</b> <b>their</b> efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries.

The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

He suffered an adverse reaction to his first treatment, but continued the program after a period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even <b>though</b> <b>their</b> philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E

However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, <b>though</b> <b>their</b> military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E

Set in New York City in the 1930s, and {{designed}} {{in the style of}} Al Hirschfeld's known caricatures of the time, the story follows four individuals, Duke, Joe, Rachel, and John, who wish for a better life. The segment ends with all four getting their wish, <b>though</b> <b>their</b> stories interact with each other's without any of them knowing. Introduced by Quincy Jones with pianist Ralph Grierson.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, <b>though,</b> <b>their</b> population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts.

A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months later}} a second {{opportunity}} presented itself. Another old ship, the Haines, sank {{in shallow water}} while being towed off Plum Tree Island and became a hazard to navigation.
