5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of <b>the</b> <b>tightest</b> known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E

Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. <b>The</b> <b>tightest</b> level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E

Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested by one of <b>the</b> <b>tightest</b> votings (213-213) in {{the entire history of}} the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{concept of}} T-theory is <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> {{span of a}} metric space.

The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are <b>the</b> <b>tightest,</b> these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing.

During his first season, Parma were eliminated {{in the second round of}} the Coppa Italia, but finished in sixth place in Serie A that season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Parma also reached the quarter-finals of the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup that season.

Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the Coppa Italia and in the first round of the UEFA Cup that season.
