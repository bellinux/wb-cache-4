5|$|D.C. United and {{the city}} signed a final {{construction}} agreement on June 8. The agreement required that the facility seat a minimum of 17,000 people, and established <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> the lease at 30 years for a minimal $1 per year. The agreement also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> the lease. Mayor Bowser then submitted the agreement, as well as land purchase agreements and a revised developer agreement, to the City Council for approval; the council approved the land purchase agreements on June 30, 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to empirical research on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. We start by proposing {{a method for}} constructing different measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. This is achieved by estimating a range of substitution elasticities using a panel data approach and highly disaggregated data on trade flows. Next, various measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade and trade margins are related to productivity and demand proxies. We find that domestic demand side movements are positively related to <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade, while domestic productivity gains result in a deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade.

40|$|My {{empirical}} analysis a {{reveals a}} strong link between <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade {{of industrial and}} developing countries.

Similarly, I find that <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade fluctuations of industrial countries are heavily influenced by movements in the relative price of manufactured exports and commodity imports. This means that improvements in <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of developing countries imply a worsening in <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of developing industrial countries, and vice versa.

5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he {{considered}} to be an overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles.

40|$|Modern {{economic}} growth involves {{the flow of}} capital and labor between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. <b>The</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade between <b>the</b> agricultural and nonagricultural sectors affect that flow. To find <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade in economic development, I have analyzed {{its effect on the}} transfer of capital between agriculture and nonagriculture and factors affecting changes in <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade, from <b>the</b> perspective of economic development in Japan and Taiwan. When <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade are favorable to the agriculture sector, it attracts more capital investment, its production shifts upwards, and labor productivity increases. This expansion of production increases the marketable surplus of agricultural products and turns <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade against <b>the</b> sector. Any actual deterioration in <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade induces investors to allocate a larger share of investment to the other sector; but that in time leads to relative overproduction and consequent deterioration <b>of</b> that sector's <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. Such investment behavior, responsive to changes in market conditions throughout the economy, has therefore caused relatively faster growth of one sector in one period, and of the other in next. In both Japan and Taiwan the movement in <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade correlates well with the relative growth rates of the two sectors. Agriculture's <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade improved when the sector's growth was relatively slow compared to nonagriculture and declined when growth was relatively fast.
