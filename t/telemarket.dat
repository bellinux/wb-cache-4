40|$|O setor de <b>telemarketing</b> encontra-se em expansão no Brasil e surge como uma primeira oportunidade de emprego formal. No <b>telemarketing</b> ativo, o papel do teleoperador é o contato direto com o cliente é ele quem faz a ligação, enquanto que, no receptivo, ele recebe a ligação. Neste cenário, a voz torna-se uma ferramenta de trabalho essencial, pois grande parte do desempenho do teleoperador relaciona-se diretamente à comunicação verbal. A voz necessita, para uma boa comunicação, variações de pitch, loudness, velocidade de fala, entoação. Esses parâmetros estão relacionados à prosódia. A {{literatura}} apresenta poucos estudos que contemplam a entoação no <b>telemarketing.</b> O presente estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar o perfil entoacional do operador de <b>telemarketing,</b> assim como identificar o tipo de padrão entoacional mais aceito pelos clientes de operadoras de telefonia celular. Para tanto, foi aplicado um questionário a 212 clientes de empresas de telefonia celular, realizado um estudo da entoação de 40 teleoperadores com base na Teoria Interacional da Entoação, desenvolvida por David Brazil, e apresentadas, a 100 clientes, gravações dos padrões mais recorrentes para que identificassem os mais aceitos. Os resultados mais representativos foram: os clientes percebem diferenças entre as formas de atendimento do <b>telemarketing</b> ativo do receptivo, principalmente, os de faixa etária mais jovem (20 a 30 anos); foi identificado como padrão mais recorrente, entre as 40 falas transcritas, o tom ascendente, tanto no <b>telemarketing</b> ativo quanto no receptivo. Contudo, no <b>telemarketing</b> ativo, o segundo padrão mais recorrente foi o descendente, e no <b>telemarketing</b> receptivo, foi o descendente-ascendente. De acordo com a avaliação de 100 clientes, os quais escutaram gravações de vozes de teleoperadores, os tons ascendentes e descendentes, independente do tipo de <b>telemarketing,</b> foram considerados naturais, e o tom descendente-ascendente foi considerado exagerado ou caricato. No <b>telemarketing</b> ativo, o padrão descendente foi mais aceito, e no <b>telemarketing</b> receptivo, os tons ascendentes. O padrão descendente-ascendente teve uma avaliação mais positiva pelos clientes do sexo masculino. Dessa forma, podemos concluir que é necessário conhecer o perfil do cliente que irá utilizar os serviços de <b>telemarketing</b> da empresa, seja ele receptivo ou ativo, para que o operador possa adequar a entoação à forma mais agradável ao clienteThe <b>telemarketing</b> {{sector is}} in frank expansion in Brasil, {{and for many}} it represents the initial opportunity for formal employment. In active <b>telemarketing,</b> the operator calls the customer whereas in receptive <b>telemarketing</b> the call is made by the customer. Since there is no face to face interaction performance of the operator, in both modalities, is solely dependent {{on his or her}} verbal communication skills. Thus, their voice is probably the most important component for success. For good communication there must be variations in voice pitch, loudness, speed and intonation, which are essential for good prosody. However, there are relatively few studies examining the subject of intonation in <b>telemarketing.</b> Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize the intonation profile of <b>telemarketing</b> operators, as well as to identify the intonation pattern more widely accepted by the customers of a cellular telephony company. For this, a questionnaire was applied to 212 customers and an analysis of the intonation of 40 <b>telemarketing</b> operators conducted using Brazils Interactive Theory of Intonation. 50 customers were also asked to listen to audio recordings containing the most frequent intonation patterns and requested to identify the most pleasant ones. Differences in customer service were observed between the two modalities of <b>telemarketing</b> (active or receptive), especially by younger customers (20 - 30 year olds). Of the 40 discourses evaluated, the most recurrent intonation pattern was the rise pattern both in the active and receptive <b>telemarketing</b> modalities. In active <b>telemarketing,</b> however, the second most prevalent pattern was the fall pattern, whereas in the receptive modality it was the fall-rise pattern. Based on the opinion of the 100 customers that listened to the recordings, it may be concluded that regardless of the type of <b>telemarketing,</b> the rise and fall patterns were considered more natural, in contrast to the fall-rise, pattern which was perceived as exagerated or caricatured. In active telemarmarketing the fall pattern was more widely accepted whereas the rise pattern was better accepted in receptive <b>telemarketing.</b> In addition, the rise and fall pattern was more positively evaluated by male customers. Thus, it may be concluded that, regardless of the type of <b>telemarketing,</b> it is necessary for the company to study the profile of its customers in order for its operators to use the most adequate voice intonatio...|$|R

50|$|It was {{determined}} that <b>Telemarketing</b> is different from other sales activities {{due to the fact}} that sales activities can be carried out by sellers across state lines without direct contact with the consumer.

There was found to be an estimated $40 billion a year lost to <b>telemarketing</b> fraud, and that consumers are victimized by non-monetary forms of <b>telemarketing</b> fraud as well.

50|$|<b>Tele{{marketing}}</b> is {{the type}} of marketing communication transmitted through telephone. There are 2 types of telemarketing: Outbound and Inbound.
