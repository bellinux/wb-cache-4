5|$|Though {{there are}} doubts about <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Horse Prophecy as a whole, several sources {{attribute}} to Smith {{the idea that}} the United States Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings with regard to the Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|Origen's {{statement}} in his Commentary on Matthew (...) that Josephus [...] "did not accept Jesus as Christ", is usually {{seen as a}} confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generally accepted fact that Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah. This forms a key external argument against <b>the</b> total <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Testimonium in that Josephus, as a Jew, would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and the reference to [...] "he was Christ" [...] in the Testimonium must be a Christian interpolation. Based on this observation alone, Paul L. Maier calls the case for <b>the</b> total <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Testimonium [...] "hopeless". Almost all modern scholars reject <b>the</b> total <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Testimonium, while <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> scholars still hold that it includes an authentic kernel.|$|R

5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{head has}} long been debated, and has {{resulted}} in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell. Rumours and conspiracy theories have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E

5|$|The work {{consists}} of three sections, an introduction, a central section that details the trial itself, and a conclusion. The introduction and conclusion summarise St-Calais' career {{before and after the}} trial. Although <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Book of Mormon.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus.

5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casket letters {{has been}} the source of much {{controversy}} among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|The {{early works}} of Tevaram by the 7th-century poets Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mention {{the town had}} {{fortified}} walls, busy road building and a busy port. The inscriptions from the Kayarohanswami temple indicate the construction was initiated {{during the reign of}} the Pallava king, Narasimha Pallava II (691–729 CE). A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. Thirumangai Azhwar, the 9th century vaishnavite saint poet, is believed to have stolen the golden Buddha statue to fund the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory is questionable.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attestation}} of the Latin term {{is attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852.

The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately, but {{is likely to be}} from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief is}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. <b>The</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts upon <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, {{published}} in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson {{argued that the}} codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to {{the hand of a}} forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E
