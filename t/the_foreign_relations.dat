5|$|Following the Council of Trent (1563), Pope Pius V (1566–1572) drew up {{the terms}} {{for the office}} of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the {{temporal}} affairs of the Papal States and <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>relations</b> of the Holy See. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of the Superintendent between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, Michele Bonelli, as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a papal bull of March 14, 1566. However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995.

5|$|One such {{success of}} {{diplomacy}} came with Willy Brandt's ascension to the West German chancellorship in 1969, as West GermanSoviet tension started to ease.

5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E
5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} {{took control of the}} Senate. Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The most {{pressing}} foreign policy concerns when Grant took office were resolving the Alabama claims against Great Britain and whether to recognize Cuban belligerency. The {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom stemmed from a complex of grievances centering on attacks on American shipping during the Civil War by the , a Confederate warship constructed in England. Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations. Sumner convinced his fellow Senators to reject the Johnson administration's proposed settlement, believing that Britain should directly pay $2 billion in gold or, alternatively, cede Canada to the United States. Fish and Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines. To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, {{which would have been}} inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington, which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote in 1871.|$|E
