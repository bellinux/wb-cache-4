5|$|The geology of <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area {{includes}} one of {{the most}} complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> and in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> National Park area range in age from about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b>|$|E

5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b> They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E

Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour.|$|E

5|$|Driving {{through the}} east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce Canyon National Park in the north or to the north rim of <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> in the south. Due to the narrowness of the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only drive through the tunnel during limited hours.|$|E
5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>the</b> central <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon,</b> <b>the</b> Surprise Canyon and [...] Temple Butte {{formations}} have equivalent thicknesses, averaging 75-150 ft. The {{major difference}} between the two is that the Devonian Temple Butte was deposited in <b>the</b> western <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon,</b> and regions in Nevada, on the passive margin of the North American proto continent; the continental shelf was subsiding, and the Temple Butte reached a thickness of about 400 ft in west <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> at <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Wash Cliffs, and even greater thicknesses 2000 ft) in the Frenchman Mountain region of Nevada.|$|R

5|$|No record {{exists for}} the next 1.2billion years of Jerome's {{geologic}} history. Evidence from <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon,</b> further north in Arizona, suggests that thick layers of sediment may have been laid down atop the ore bodies and later eroded away.

5|$|The {{formations}} {{exposed in}} the area of the park are part of the Grand Staircase. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon,</b> the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.|$|E
5|$|The {{time scale}} and {{sequence}} {{over which the}} river's present course and <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean – possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, forming the Monterey submarine canyon. The uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains began about 4.5million years ago, diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an antecedent stream) and began to cut <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b> Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.|$|E

5|$|Three deep canyons {{are located}} in the park, cut through the {{volcanic}} tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000years. The Lewis River flows through Lewis Canyon in the south, and the Yellowstone River has carved two colorful canyons, <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> of the Yellowstone and the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E

5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled from <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|E

The team then travelled to San Francisco, via the Niagara Falls, Chicago, and <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b> In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6.

5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin.

An ocean started to return to <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
