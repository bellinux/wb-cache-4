Research has been conducted to try to identify issues that arise when someone is a COA. It has been hard to isolate these issues solely {{to the fact that the}} child’s parents are alcoholics.

25|$|The PEMFC {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to mobile phones, because of its compactness. However, the water management is crucial to performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop. Water management {{is a very difficult}} subject in PEM systems, primarily because water in the membrane is attracted toward the cathode of the cell through polarization. A wide variety of solutions for managing the water exist including integration of electroosmotic pumps. Furthermore, the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by carbon monoxide (no more than one part per million is usually acceptable) and the membrane is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> metal ions, which can be introduced by corrosion of metallic bipolar plates, metallic components in the fuel cell system or from contaminants in the fuel/oxidant.|$|E
500|$|Critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar {{work as an}} {{integral}} element of Pink Floyd's sound. Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their [...] "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" [...] list and di Perna described him {{as the most important}} guitarist of the 1970s, calling him [...] "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen." [...] In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: [...] " [...] fingers make a distinctive sound... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable... The way I play melodies is connected <b>to</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> Hank Marvin and the Shadows". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.|$|E

In January 2002, {{it was confirmed that}} actor Matt Damon would guest star on Will & Grace. In the same month, it was announced that NBC would extend [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] with four additional minutes to accommodate the network's [...] "supersize" [...] plan to compete against the CBS reality show Survivor. Jeff Zucker, who at the time was President of NBC Entertainment, said that the show's producers approached NBC about the [...] "supersizing" [...] idea {{rather than the other way}} around; [...] "When scripts came in long, [...] asked NBC if the network could handle a few extra minutes of footage." [...] Zucker commented that the lengthening of this episode [...] "turned out great, and there was no real extra work for anyone.

500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back <b>to</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

He was illustrated by Yūsuke Kozaki, and his clothing was designed by Takeshi Uechi. He was based on Jackass star Johnny Knoxville. His beam sword's charging method was based on the [...] "Schwartz" [...] lightsabers from the parody film Spaceballs. Travis' name, like other characters' names in No More Heroes, comes from its sound rather than its meaning. He stated that it is a name that sounds cool to Japanese people, but not as much to Western people. Suda comments that he sees some of himself in Travis, and wishes that he could react <b>to</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> Travis does. Travis' luchador fandom comes from Suda's fandom for the sport.|$|E
