25|$|Navajo is {{difficult}} to classify in terms of broad morphological typology: it relies heavily on affixes—mainly prefixes—like agglutinative languages, but these affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult <b>to</b> <b>segment,</b> a trait of fusional languages. In general, Navajo verbs contain more morphemes than do nouns (on average, 11 for verbs compared to 4–5 for nouns), but noun morphology is less transparent. Navajo is sometimes classified as a fusional language and sometimes as agglutinative or even polysynthetic.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that this problem is intimately linked {{with the ability to}} parse language, and that those words that are easy <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> due to their high {{transitional}} probabilities are also easier to map to an appropriate referent. This serves as further evidence of the developmental progression of language acquisition, with children requiring an understanding of the sound distributions of natural languages to form phonetic categories, parse words based on these categories, and then use these parses to map them to objects as labels.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E

2500|$|Antovich and Graf Estes [...] {{found that}} 14 month old bilingual {{children}} {{are better than}} monolinguals at segmenting two different artificial languages using transitional probability cues.

2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language learning. Children have to learn to distinguish different sounds and <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it has to learn <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child {{has to be able to}} distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child has to learn to produce these words.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the large}} role that {{statistical}} learning appears {{to play in}} lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> words.

[...] Real speech, though, has {{many different types of}} cues to word boundaries, including prosodic and phonotactic information.|$|E
