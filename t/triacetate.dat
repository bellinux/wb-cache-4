40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} chiral Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) substituted with Nbinaphthyl groups. Their catalytic utility is examined in homogenous organometallic reactions and organocatalysis. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to asymmetric catalysis. The use of chiral phosphines is described, followed by the properties, design and applications of chiral NHCs. Chapter 2 discusses the synthesis of NHC precursors with biaryl substituents and chirality at the 4 - and 5 -positions of the imidazole. Two pathways utilising Pdcatalysed reactions were examined, however preparation of the target compound proved challenging. This resulted {{in the development of}} a new design, where chirality is moved from the backbone to the Nsubstituents. This approach required access to atropisomeric binapthyl amines as the key starting materials. Chapter 3 {{describes the}} synthesis of atropisomeric binaphthyl amines using the asymmetric PinheyBarton chemistry and the BINOL approach. Chiral oxazoline ligands were applied to the PinheyBarton reaction for the first time, and their interactions with aryllead <b>triacetates</b> investigated using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The preparation of the required binaphthyl amine was achieved by selective functionalisation of (M) BINOL. Chapter 4 describes the transformation of the atropisomeric binaphthyl amine into imidazolium salt disubstituted with chiral binaphthyls. Complexes with transition metals were synthesised and their electronic properties and conformational stabilities examined using spectroscopic techniques. In catalysis, the new Rh(I) NHC complexes showed good reactivities in the asymmetric hydrosilylation and hydrogen transfer reactions, however only poor enantioselecties were observed. Efforts to improve reactivity did not result in a corresponding increase in enantioselectivity, highlighting the need to minimise exocyclic CN bond rotation. Expansion of the family of atropisomeric NHC precursors to include 1, 2, 4 triazolium and thiazolium salts and their application in organocatalysis is described in Chapter 5. The fluxionality of the heteroazolium salts was examined using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. They showed interesting reactivities in the Stetter and BaylisHillman reactions, giving an insight into the effect of the steric properties of the NHC on chemoselectivity.

We too have been attracted towards understanding, exploring and mimicking {{a few of these}} magnificent molecular entities. Our efforts are directed towards the synthesis of two types of molecular assembles of contemporary interest; first of them are medium ring carbohydrate mimetics which are unnatural compounds inspired by Nature and other class consisted of the terpenoid natural products which are conceived and assembled by Nature in ever increasing numbers. The spectacular development of carbohydrate mimetics, prompted primarily by their properties as glycosidase inhibitors, has led to the conception and synthesis {{of a wide variety of}} novel structures, the most significant ones belonging to the families of imino sugars and carbasugars. Major advances in diverse subjects such as chemical synthesis, analytical chemistry, structural biology, cell-surface recognition, molecular modeling and spectroscopy have made carbohydrate mimetics embraced by scientific community with increasing vigor. A major area of interest of organic chemistry is the total synthesis of complex natural products conceived and created by Nature. As a result of refinements in isolation and purification techniques and recent advances in spectroscopy and crystallography, unravelling of natural products from exotic species such as wild plants to microorganisms and from geographic locations ranging from mountain tops to the ocean floors, has made identification and structural elucidation of complex natural products a fairly routine exercise. Among natural products, terpenoids are considered as masterpieces of structural diversity with their bewildering carbocyclic arrangements and diverse functionalities embedded in them. The present thesis entitled “Synthesis of medium ring carbasugar analogues and terpenoid natural products” is an effort to design and synthesise natural and unnatural molecular entities either conceived by human mind or inspired by Nature. The research described in this thesis has been organized under three chapters. Chapter I: Design and synthesis of cyclooctanoid and cyclononanoid carbasugar analogues. Chapter II: A total synthesis of putative structure of sesquiterpenoid natural product dichomitol. Chapter III: A total synthesis of diterpenoid natural product guanacastepene C. A brief overview of each of these three chapters is presented below. (For Equations and Figures Refer PDF File) Chapter I: Design and synthesis of cyclooctanoid and cyclononanoid carbasugar analogues In recent years, the search for new therapeutically useful glycosidase inhibitors, mimicking carbohydrates 1, has extended beyond the realm of five and six membered cyclitols 2 (carbasugars), and targeted towards the medium-sized carbocyclic cores. In this context, we have conceptulised a new family of novel cyclooctanoid 3 and cyclononanoid 4 carbasugar analogues in order to study the effect of the enhanced flexibility and of new spatial distribution displayed by these structures on their adaptability in the active site of the enzymes. We have developed a versatile synthesis of cyclooctane based polyols 3 from commercially available hydrocarbon cyclooctatetraene 5. It was visualised that a bicyclo[4. 2. 1]nona- 2, 4, 7 -trien- 9 -one 6 is a functionally locked cyclooctatetraene with dispensed and differentiated double bonds and a masked C 9 cycloocta-carbasugar from which the eight membered ring can be extracted through oxidative C 1 -C 9 bond scission, Scheme 1. Several transformations in 6, leading to a range of polyhydroxylated cyclooctanoids was envisaged. Bayer-villiger oxidation in ketone 6 was smooth and led to a δ-lactone which on catalytic OsO 4 dihydroxylation furnished diol 7. Further acetylation on 7 delivered a rearranged γ-lactone 8. LAH reduction in 8 and peracetylation furnished diene 9. Controlled catalytic hydrogenation in 8 furnished 1 : 1 mixture of 10 and 11, which on hydride reduction gave tetrols 12 and 13, respectively, Scheme 2. Protection of vic diol in 12 led to 14. Hydroboration-oxidation of 14 and peracetylation furnished three diastereomeric mixture of acetonide <b>triacetates</b> in 9 : 4 : 1 ratio and they were hydrolysed to give 15 - 17, Scheme 3. Interestingly, pentahydroxy 16 is an eight membered analogue of α-talose.

Acetylation of 12 led to tertraacetate 18 which on OsO 4 -dihydroxylation and acetylation furnished two diastereomeric hexaacetates in 1 : 1 ratio. Hydrolysis of these hexaacetates with base furnished 19 - 20, Scheme 4. Reagents and conditions: i) Ac 2 O, Py, 90 % ii) OsO 4, NMMO, acetone-H 2 O iii) Ac 2 O, Py, 72 % (2 steps) iv) NaOMe, MeOH, 75 %. Diene 9 on exhaustive stereoselective double dihydroxylation and base hydrolysis led to octahydroxycyclooctane 21, Scheme 5. A cyclooctane derivative bearing eight oxygen atoms has been prepared for the first time. Reagents and conditions: i) OsO 4, NMMO, acetone-H 2 O ii) NaOMe, MeOH, 56 % (2 steps). In an unconventional but interesting enterprise, commercially available hydrocarbon cyclooctatetraene 5 has been elaborated to a rare hexose sugar (DL) -β-allose and its 2 C branched analogue. The main theme in this approach was to generate a cyclic acetal moiety, a structural characteristic of sugars through ozonolytic cleavage of an appropriately crafted olefin and in situ intramolecular acetalisation, Scheme 6. Acetonide protection in 7 led to 22. LAH reduction in 22 liberated the diol and selective primary alcohol protection as TBS derivative furnished 23. Ozonolysis of 23 and PCC oxidation of the resulting lactal 24 led to lactone 25. Methoxide mediated lactone opening in 25 and protection of anomeric hydroxyl group as methyl ether led to 26. LAH reduction of ester led to 27 and further deprotections furnished (DL) -methyl- 2 -deoxy- 2 C-hydroxymethyl-β-allose 28. Protected hexose homologue 27 was converted via a mesylate to the terminal olefin 29 through a series of functional group transformations. Ozonolysis of 29 furnished hemiacetal 30, which on sodium borohydride reduction and acetonide deprotection delivered (DL) -methyl-β-allopyranoside 31, Scheme 7. Motivated and encouraged by the synthesis of cyclooctane carbasugar analogues, it was decided to venture into the synthesis of cyclononane carbasugar analogues. It was visualized that appropriately functionalized bicyclo[4. 3. 1]decane system 32, can serve as a masked C 10 cyclononane carbasugar from which the nine membered ring can be extracted through the C 1 -C 10 bond scission, Scheme 8.

The bridged dienone 32 was readily prepared from cyclohexanone following a literature protocol. Ketone 32 on Bayer-Villiger oxidation furnished lactone 33 in moderate yield, and further exhaustive double dihydroxylation furnished two unanticipated rearranged products δ-lactone 34 and γ-lactone 35 in 5 : 3 ratio. Both, the novel lactones 34 and 35 were further elaborated to the corresponding hexahydroxy cyclononane carbasugar analogues 36 and 37, Scheme 9. These novel medium ring carbasugar analogues involving a nine memebered carbocycle have been synthesized for the first time.

5000|$|Polyester is {{much more}} {{resistant}} to polymer degradation than either nitrate or <b>triacetate.</b> Although <b>triacetate</b> does not decompose in as dangerous a way as nitrate does, it is still subject to {{a process known as}} deacetylation, often nicknamed [...] "vinegar syndrome" [...] (due to the acetic acid smell of decomposing film) by archivists, which causes the film to shrink, deform, become brittle and eventually unusable. PET, like cellulose mononitrate, is less prone to stretching than other available plastics. By the late 1990s, polyester had almost entirely superseded <b>triacetate</b> for the production of intermediate elements and release prints.|$|E
