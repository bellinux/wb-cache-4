GM chairman Thomas Murphy approved the Aerovette for 1980 production, but Mitchell's retirement that year, combined with then Corvette chief engineer Dave McLellan's lack of enthusiasm for the mid-engine design and slow-selling data on mid-engined cars killed the last hope for a mid-engine Corvette.|$|E
50|$|The J-series is Honda's fourth V6 engine family, {{introduced}} in 1996. It is a 60° V6 - Honda's existing C-series were 90° engines. The J-series {{was designed for}} <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting.</b> It has a shorter bore spacing (98 mm), shorter connecting rods, and a special smaller crankshaft than the C-series for compactness. All current J-series engines are gasoline-powered SOHC 4-valve designs with VTEC variable valve timing.|$|E
50|$|Bore {{and stroke}} were {{identical}} to the Duratec 25 at 82.4 mm and 79.5 mm, respectively. The engines shared other traits as well, and insiders report that the designs are related, though not closely. Notably, the two engines share the same bell housing pattern and 60° V angle. The 60° angle makes it compact and more suitable for <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting,</b> {{but it is not}} ideally balanced—V8s are typically 90°—necessitating the use of a counter-rotating balance shaft.|$|E

50|$|The Chevrolet Aerovette was {{a concept}} car created by Chevrolet, {{beginning}} life as Experimental Project 882 (XP-882) {{in the late}} 1960s. It had a mid-engine configuration using a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting</b> of its V8 engine. Zora Arkus-Duntov's engineers originally built two XP-882 prototypes during 1969, but John DeLorean, Chevrolet's general manager, canceled the program believing it to be impractical and costly. However, when Ford announced plans to sell the DeTomaso Pantera through Lincoln-Mercury dealers, DeLorean ordered that one XP-882 prototype be cleaned up for display at the 1970 New York Auto Show.|$|E
5000|$|The 23EW {{was built}} in Chihuahua, Mexico for {{transverse}} installation in several front-drive Ford/Mercury/Mazda vehicles through the 2009 model year. [...] "EW" [...] in the Ford designation code denotes East-West configuration, or <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting.</b> Three versions of the 23EW have been produced. A standard DOHC 16V version {{was used in the}} North American Focus producing [...] at 5750 rpm with [...] of torque at 4250 rpm. An iVCT (intake variable cam timing)-equipped DOHC 16V version was used in the 2006-2009 Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan, and several generations of CD2-based crossovers.|$|E
50|$|Based on past {{experiences}} with SPAAG designs, Soviet engineers designed {{a vehicle that}} used a modified T-54 chassis, with four twin road wheels per side instead of five, and much thinner armour. The vehicle was armed with twin 57 mm S-68 autocannon in a new, large, rotating, open-topped turret. The ZSU-57-2 consists of three compartments: driver's in the front, fighting {{in the middle and}} engine-transmission at the rear. The hull is more spacious in comparison with the T-54 because of the thinner armour and has different locations for some equipment. The general layout, with <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting</b> of the engine, is the same.|$|E

5000|$|The Honda VFR1200F is the 7th {{generation}} Honda sport touring motorcycle {{from the}} VF and VFR line motorcycles {{powered by a}} <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> V4 engine. The VFR1200F has several new technologies including the first dual clutch transmission offered on a motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|Every {{cylinder}} added beyond five {{increases the}} overlap of firing strokes and makes for less primary order vibration. An inline-six gets a power stroke every 120 degrees. So {{there is more}} overlap (180° - 120° = 60°) than in a five-cylinder engine (180° - 144° = 36°). However, this increase in smoothness of a six-cylinder engine over a five-cylinder engine is not as pronounced {{as that of a}} five-cylinder engine over a four-cylinder engine. The inline-five loses less power to friction as compared to an inline-six. It also uses fewer parts, and it is physically shorter, so it requires less room in the engine bay, allowing for <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before World War II (1934), {{the front}} wheel drive Citroen Traction Avant had {{independent}} front torsion bar suspension and a flexible trailing dead axle, also sprung by torsion bars. The flexibility of the axle beam provided wheel location features like a twist beam axle. The Czechoslovakian Tatra cars, designed by professor Hans Ledwinka in the mid-1930s, used all around independent torsion bar suspensions, along with air cooled rear engines. Also in the 1930s, prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting</b> style. Ledwinka's concept had been copied by Ferdinand Porsche, whose successors later had to acknowledge the influence of Ledwinka's sophisticated Tatra models on the Porsche-designed Kdf-Wagen of 1938 (later renamed the Beetle), a post-war lawsuit resulting in a DM3,000,000 settlement paid by Volkswagen to Ringhoffer-Tatra in 1961.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the other}} models were {{executive}} cars, the Croma was marketed {{in the large}} family car segment, replacing the Fiat Argenta in the Fiat lineup. The Croma was the first large car produced by Fiat to feature a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> engine and front wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|The Empire was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1901 until 1902. A {{product of}} Sterling, Illinois, it featured a vee-twin Steam engine geared to its right-hand rear wheel. It had a rectangular, <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> boiler with horizontal tubes across the chassis. Coachwork {{was of the}} motor buggy style.|$|R
50|$|A {{yaw damper}} is a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> shock {{absorber}} {{used to prevent}} railcars and locomotives from swaying excessively from side to side. Yaw dampers prevent locomotives and passenger railcars from striking station platforms as they roll past them and reduce the gap that must be left between the railroad vehicle and the platform.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to <b>transverse</b> <b>mounting</b> while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive end a steel adapter fit the ends of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, Cadillac {{introduced}} a brand-new front-wheel drive platform. Cadillac put the De Ville and introduced the Cadillac Fleetwood on this platform. This car featured two [...] "firsts"; It {{had the first}} <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> V8 ever (the HT4100) {{and it was the}} first car to have a high mounted stop-lamp that was federally mandated for the 1986 model year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{independent}} front suspension used a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> {{leaf spring}} mounted above the wheel centre line. The hubs were located with the spring mounts {{at the top and}} control arms at the bottom.

5000|$|With {{placement}} of the engine and transmission assembly in a fore/aft position (longitudinally), the front axle is placed rearwards behind the engine, {{which leads to the}} criticism of some Audi vehicles as being nose heavy, though the system still leads to better weight distributions than <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> engine packages as in Mitsubishis and similar cars. This allows for a better weight distribution of 55:45 (F:R).|$|R
5000|$|The Ant used an A-Series engine, <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> {{and tilted}} {{slightly}} backward to allow greater ground clearance and suspension movement. The main gearbox {{was placed in}} the engine sump, as on the Mini. A reduction gearbox took power from the main gearbox to the rear axle via a propshaft. The same layout was used 30 years later (with a K-Series engine) on the Rover Group's Land Rover Freelander.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CB400F is a {{motorcycle}} produced by Honda from 1975 to 1977.

Fuelling was provided by four 20 mm Keihin carburettors. The CB400F {{is commonly known as}} the Honda 400 Four.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} powerplant for the X6 {{range was}} a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> 2.2L OHC straight-six engine, {{based on the}} 1500/1750 Austin Maxi unit. At {{the time of the}} X6's introduction, {{it would have been the}} only car in production with a transverse straight-six-cylinder engine in the world. The Tasman's single carburettor configuration produced [...] and the Kimberley [...] with its extra carburettor. Both were sold with either a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|A new lighter V8 {{engine was}} rushed into {{production}} for 1982, the HT-4100 (option code LT8). It was a 4100 cc V8, designed for rear-wheel-drive and longitudinal front-wheel-drive applications {{sharing the same}} [...] "Metric" [...] transmission bellhousing pattern as Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac rear- and front-wheel drivetrains for 2.5 L 4-cylinder and 2.8, 3.1, and 3.3 L V6. A new line of downsized Cadillac cars with the <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> V8 engine was slated for 1983. However, delays in the downsizing program shared with Buick and Oldsmobile postponed the introduction of those models until 1985.|$|R
50|$|It {{was unique}} in {{that not only was}} it one of the first <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> {{automatic}} transmission units tailored for front wheel drive, {{it was one of the}} smallest in order to be used in the transmission-in-sump installation beneath the A-series engine used in the Mini, and later the 1100/1300 ranges. Another novel feature was that the transmission was designed to use the engine's lubricating oil, rather than conventional automatic transmission fluid (ATF). The units were manufactured in a BMC plant in Kings Norton, Birmingham which supplied complete powertrain packages (the unit required a unique engine variant) to the Longbridge and Cowley assembly plants.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} as a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> FWD-only power-plant being the second engine/gearbox combination to exhibit the now standard transverse engine-next-to-gearbox layout with unequal length driveshafts (the first was the Autobianchi Primula, the Mini had its gearbox in the sump of the engine). The exception to the engines FWD-only design is its revolutionary use as a mid-engine drive-train in the Fiat X1/9. Also Tofaş has adapted 128 engines into its Fiat 131 based longitudinally mounted engine with rear wheel drive layout platform. Unusual for the time was the electrically driven fan, rather than it being powered directly by the engine. The 128 engine has five crankshaft bearings.|$|R

5000|$|The van {{received}} a mid-life major facelift in Q4 2003, with the headlight area being heavily restyled (together with cosmetic changes to rear lights, wing mirrors, and dashboard), {{resulting in the}} front end somewhat resembling the smaller Trafic. Like its predecessor, the van was available {{in a number of}} sizes and configurations, and was a popular base for conversion to ambulance bodywork. For the face-lifted Master the 2.8 litre engine option was replaced in some markets with the 3.0 litre ZD3 engine derived from the Nissan ZD30 engine, variants ZD3 200 or 202 for <b>transverse</b> <b>mount</b> front wheel drive arrangements and variants; 600, 604, 606 or 608 for rear wheel drive arrangements.

5000|$|The Alfa Romeo Diva is {{a concept}} car of the Italian {{automobile}} manufacturer Alfa Romeo.The car was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in 2006.The car was developed through a collaboration between Centro Stile Alfa Romeo, Fiat Group's research center Elasis and the Espera design school led by Franco Sbarro.The design of the car {{goes back to the}} icon Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale, making use of the butterfly doors. Although the car has the characteristic Alfa-nose,the nose is much like a Formula 1 car on. The car is built on a heavily modified chassis from an Alfa Romeo 159 and a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> 3.2 liter [...] Busso V6. The car has top speed of 270 km/h and can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in five seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Virtually all New Look buses were {{powered by}} Detroit Diesel 71-series two-cycle Diesel engines. The {{original}} engine was the 6V71 (V6). GM buses used a unique [...] "Angle-drive" [...] configuration with a <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> engine. The transmission angled {{off at a}} 45-or-so degree angle to connect to the rear axle. The engines were canted backwards for maintenance access; in fact, the only parts not accessible from outside the bus were the right-hand exhaust manifold and the starter. The entire engine-transmission-radiator assembly was mounted on a cradle that could be quickly removed and replaced, allowing the bus to return to service with minimal delay when the powertrain required major maintenance. Originally, all New Looks were powered by the 6V-71. GM resisted V8 power but eventually gave in to pressure from customers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transversely}} mounted engine {{combined with}} front-wheel drive was popularized by the 1959 Mini; there the transmission was {{built into the}} sump of the engine, and drive was transferred to it via a set of primary gears. Another variant transmission concept was used by Simca in the 1960s keeping the engine and transmission in line, but <b>transverse</b> <b>mounted</b> and with unequal length driveshafts. This has proven itself to be the model on which almost all modern FWD vehicles are now based. Peugeot and Renault on their jointly developed small car engine of the 1970s where the 4-cylinder block was canted over to reduce the overall height of the engine with the transmission underneath (PSA X engine). The tendency of this layout to generate unwanted transmission [...] "whine" [...] has seen it fall out of favour. Also, clutch changes required engine removal.|$|R
25|$|The Type O had an all-steel {{tailskid}} undercarriage, {{with a pair}} of spoked mainwheels on split axles hinged {{from the}} centre of a <b>transverse</b> rod <b>mounted</b> on four longitudinal V-struts, arranged as an inverted W from the inner, under-fuselage interplane struts. Rubber springs damped the movement of the outer ends and wheels on landing.|$|R
50|$|The 321 was {{introduced}} {{at the start}} of 1939 as a successor to the BMW 320. It sat on a shortened version of the BMW 326 chassis. The 321 differed from the 320 in its front suspension, its larger tyres, and its styling. While the 320 used front suspension derived from the BMW 303, with a high <b>mounted</b> <b>transverse</b> leaf spring and lower control arms, the 321 used the front suspension from the 326, with upper control arms and a low <b>mounted</b> <b>transverse</b> leaf spring.|$|R
