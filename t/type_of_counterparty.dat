40|$|The US dollar {{shortage}} {{in global}} banking 1 Understanding {{the global financial}} crisis and the stresses on bank balance sheets requires a perspective on banks ’ international investment positions and how these positions were funded across currencies and counterparties. This special feature uses the BIS international banking statistics to identify the cross-currency and counterparty funding patterns for the largest banking systems, and to assess {{the causes of the}} US dollar shortage during the critical phases of the crisis. JEL classification: F 34, G 01, G 21. The current financial crisis has highlighted just how {{little is known about the}} structure of banks ’ international balance sheets and their interconnectedness. During the crisis, many banks reportedly faced severe US dollar funding shortages, prompting central banks around the world to adopt unprecedented policy measures to supply them with funds. How could a US dollar shortage develop so quickly after dollar liquidity had been viewed as plentiful? Which banking systems were most affected? And how have funding pressures affected lending to non-bank end users of funds? This special feature draws on the BIS international banking statistics to provide some tentative answers to these questions. It splices together two sets of statistics to reconstruct the global balance sheet positions for each of the major national banking systems. 2 The dynamics of the crisis can then be analysed across banks ’ consolidated balance sheets rather than along geographical (ie residency-based) lines. With information on both the currency and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> for banks ’ foreign assets and liabilities, we can investigate how banks funded their foreign investments, and thus can better identify the vulnerabilities that threatened the financial system. Global banking activity had grown remarkably between 2000 and mid- 2007. As banks ’ balance sheets expanded, so did their appetite for foreig...|$|E

40|$|The 2007 – 09 {{financial}} crisis {{drew attention to}} the nature and consequences of connections among financial firms. New reporting standards set {{in the wake of the}} crisis have shed more light on these ties in current financial markets. New data are available on the magnitude of risk exposure and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> collateral that link bank holding companies with their trading partners in over-the-counter derivatives markets. The data show that both the level of risk and diversity of collateral involved in these contracts vary widely depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparties.</b> During the 2007 – 09 {{financial crisis}}, the degree to which financial institutions were linked through over-the-counter (OTC) asset markets was eye-opening and has since been identified as an important contributor to financial fragility. Financial firms have long been linked through traditional lending agreements. However, the connections created by more complex contracts, such as OTC derivatives and repurchase agreements, are more relevant to the risk these firms face because they are closely tied to the values of fast-moving financial variables. For these transactions, collateral—assets that can be seized in case of nonpayment—is stated as a standard contract term to mitigate credit losses in case a partner defaults. During the crisis, rapidly falling asset values, corresponding collateral calls, and stricte...|$|R

40|$|The {{price of}} {{financial}} derivative with unilateral counterparty credit risk {{can be expressed}} {{as the price of}} an otherwise risk-free derivative minus a credit value adjustment(CVA) component that can be seen as shorting a call option, which is exercised upon default <b>of</b> <b>counterparty,</b> on MtM <b>of</b> the derivative.

This paper models default times <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> and reference with a particular contagion model with stochastic intensities that is proposed by Bao et al. 2010. Stochastic interest rate is incorporated as well to account for positive correlation between spread and interest. Survival measure approach is adopted to calculate MtM of risk-free CDS and conditional survival probability <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> in defaultable environment. Semi-analytical solution for CVA is attained. Affine specification of intensities and interest rate concludes analytical expression for pre-default value of MtM.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in principle, agree under some simplifying assumptions. One {{of the most}} relevant assumptions is the absence <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk. Indeed, due to margining, futures have practically no counterparty risk. Forwards, instead, may bear the full risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside clearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this paper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid commodities-credit model to asses impact <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in pricing formulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler effects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and credit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case study based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk depends on volatilities and correlation and cannot be accounted for precisely through a pre-defined multiplier. ...|$|R
50|$|Credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) is {{the difference}} between the risk-free portfolio value and the true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility <b>of</b> a <b>counterparty’s</b> default. In other words, CVA is the market value <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk. This price depends on counterparty credit spreads {{as well as on the}} market risk factors that drive derivatives’ values and, therefore, exposure.

40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} is an {{important}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> financial risk. The importance <b>of</b> proper <b>counterparty</b> risk management became most apparent {{in the wake of}} the 2008 series of failures of several large banks. Correlation of market factors {{is an important}} issue in the calculation of CVA. A notable case of correlation is wrong-way risk which occurs whenever the probability of default <b>of</b> the <b>counterparty</b> is positively correlated with exposure. The basic formulas for CVA and basic counterparty credit risk models do not account for wrong-way risk because its modeling is nontrivial. This thesis aims to answer how well can the impact of wrong-way risk on CVA be approximated with an add-on which only depends on correlation between the price of the underlying asset and the credit spread <b>of</b> the <b>counterparty.</b> The thesis is supplemented by a fully documented implementation of the model in the Mathematica software...|$|R

Specifically, offering trade credit to counterparties and investing in relationship-specific assets increase the firm's exposure to counterparty risk. Further, we show that contracts with protective financial covenants and product warranties mitigate the transmission of risk. Overall, we provide evidence on the channels of supply-chain risk, and we show that shareholders recognize the role of contractual features in mitigating counterparty risk...|$|R

40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions <b>of</b> the contract. <b>Counterparty</b> credit risk is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining counterparty credit risk exposure on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring counterparty credit risk exposure on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact counterparty credit risk such as wrong-way risk and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating wrong-way risk into existing measures <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk exposure. Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default <b>of</b> the <b>counterparty</b> and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.

40|$|Counterparty risk {{denotes the}} risk that a party {{defaults}} in a bilateral contract. This risk not only depends on the two parties involved, {{but also on the}} risk from various other contracts each of these parties holds. In rather informal markets, such as the OTC (over-the-counter) derivative market, institutions only report their aggregated quarterly risk exposure, but no details about their counterparties. Hence, {{little is known about the}} diversification <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk. In this paper, we reconstruct the weighted and time-dependent network <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in the OTC derivatives market of the United States between 1998 and 2012. To proxy unknown bilateral exposures, we first study the co-occurrence patterns of institutions based on their quarterly activity and ranking in the official report. The network obtained this way is further analysed by a weighted k-core decomposition, to reveal a core-periphery structure. This allows us to compare the activity-based ranking with a topology-based ranking, to identify the most important institutions and their mutual dependencies. We also analyse correlations in these activities, to show strong similarities in the behavior of the core institutions. Our analysis clearly demonstrates the clustering <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in a small set of about a dozen US banks. This not only increases the default risk of the central institutions, but also the default risk of peripheral institutions which have contracts with the central ones. Hence, all institutions indirectly have to bear (part <b>of)</b> the <b>counterparty</b> risk <b>of</b> all others, which needs to be better reflected in the price of OTC derivatives.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to give an overview of creditvaluation adjustment (CVA) and adjacent concepts. Firstly, the historicalevents that preceded the initiative to reform the Basel regulations and tointroduce CVA as a core component <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk are illustrated. After some conceptual background material, a journey is taken through theregulatory aspects of CVA. The three most commonly used methods for calculatingthe regulatory CVA capital charge are explained in detail and potentialchallenges with the methods are addressed. Further, the document analyses ingreater depth two of the methods; the internal model method (IMM) and thecurrent exposure method (CEM). The differences between these two methods areexplained mathematically and analysed. This comparison is supported bysimulations of portfolios containing interest rate swap contracts with differenttime to maturity and <b>of</b> <b>counterparties</b> with varying credit ratings. Oneconcluding observations is that credit valuation adjustment is a measure <b>of</b> centralimportance within <b>counterparty</b> credit risk. Further, it is shown that IMM has someimportant advantages over CEM, {{especially when it comes}} to model connection withreality.
