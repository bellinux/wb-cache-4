[...] "You Didn't Mean Anything to Me", written by Dee Dee, reflects the desolation and vacillation which the bassist was feeling in his personal life as well as while he was with the band.

The eleventh track on the album is titled [...] "This Business Is Killing Me", and was written by Joey to detail how everyone expects him to please others, but he simply cannot please everyone all the time. Pleasant Dreams concludes with [...] "Sitting in My Room", which contained lyrics quoted by David Fricke in the conclusion of his review on the album, saying: [...] "'It's us against them,' sneers Joey in [...] "Sitting in My Room.' 'They just wanna worry ... /They just wanna be so lame/Maybe they should try and sniff some glue.' Or put Pleasant Dreams on the box and crank it up to ten." ...|$|E
