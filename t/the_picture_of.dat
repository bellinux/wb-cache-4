5|$|Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish {{poet and}} playwright.

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 12, 1910.

40|$|The Kangxi emperor (r. 1661 - 1722) revitalized <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving (Gengzhi Tu 耕織圖), a {{genre of}} {{painting}} that limns the procedures farmers undertake in {{the cultivation of}} rice and the manufacturing of silk. Inaugurated in the 12 th century, <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving initially had enjoyed limited imperial patronage. In contrast during the Qing era the Kangxi, Yongzheng (r. 1722 - 35) and Qianlong (r. 1735 - 1796) emperors all enthusiastically patronized the subject, with court artists producing paintings, craftsmen producing woodblock prints and even carved stone stelae. Printed versions were distributed to elite members of society. Through woodblock print albums gifted by the Qing court, <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving entered domestic popular culture, and were disseminated to Europe through diplomatic exchanges. Subsequent book publications in both China and Europe served to consolidate the iconography of this genre’s imagery. Extant examples of 18 th-century Canton trade wallpaper in Europe and the United States attest to the international appeal of <b>the</b> reproduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving in this particular medium, one of which George Macartney (1737 - 1806) personally delivered to an acquaintance. Macartney {{was not only a}} distributor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving, the publication of his papers was an opportunity to produce yet more images of agrarian laborers at work. This paper seeks to establish the parameters of the movement of the printed versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving in the 18 th and 19 th centuries. It then turns to examine the modes of exchange through which <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> Tilling and Weaving, the imagery of the production of commodities, moved between prints and paintings and became commodities themselves...|$|R

5|$|Themes {{from these}} social {{investigations}} {{have been drawn}} out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though the area has been productive of local writing talent, {{from the time of}} Oscar Wilde's <b>The</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> Dorian Gray (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a fascination for a coterie of the literati.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E

5|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century progressed, there were several other {{important}} observations about the genealogical structure of the Catalogue. In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected {{to the family of}} Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the Catalogue that was emerging began to resemble the Bibliotheca in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed {{with the help of the}} mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the Catalogue and Ehoiai were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.|$|E

Meanwhile, at least 1600 police officers were deployed to keep checking around the island, including on fisherman. The intense search was still active in mid August.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth {{painted by}} her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E
