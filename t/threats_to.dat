5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{agricultural}} practices, which {{have led to}} local population declines and range fragmentation, are the main <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> this genus, although neither species is threatened globally.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{introduced}} feral {{dogs were}} a great <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species on Isabela, but they have since been eradicated from the island.

5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity {{is the introduction}} of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} effects of freedom-limiting communication on attitude structures at three points in time. A 2 (<b>Threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom: low <b>threat</b> vs. high threat) x 2 (Restoration postscript: present vs. filler postscript) x 3 (Time: immediate-time measurement vs. one-minute delay vs. two-minute delay) plus 3 (control groups for each time point: immediate-time measurement vs. one-minute delay vs. two-minute delay) between-participants design was employed. The results replicated the findings of existing research on reactance by showing that when <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom was high, a boomerang effect emerged, leading to change in attitude and behavioral intention in the direction opposite to the one advocated in the message. This study also advanced the theory of reactance by documenting how <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom affects both the focal attitude concept targeted by the message (here, recycling) as well as a concept related to the target concept (here, energy conservation). In addition, the effects of pairing different levels of <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom with a restoration postscript were examined: The findings indicated that adding a restoration postscript (defined as the suggestion that an individual still has freedom to make a decision) <b>to</b> low <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom messages might be detrimental to persuasion as compared to adding a restoration component when <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom is high. Finally, the effects of <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom and restoration over time were considered: The results of the experiment suggest that reactance effects may not be persistent over time...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the main}} common <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> the park are glacier retreat {{due to global}} warming; {{hydropower}} projects; legal and illegal mining operations with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights to the land by the locals).|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Threat== Previously Inter{{national}} {{trade was}} major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species, but {{current status of}} the trade is unknown. However, the local and national trades create <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species (in Nepal). The direct killing is the major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species. Lack {{of knowledge about the}} species among local people is caused the most of killing the species as most of killing is not related to any good reason, apart from the use and trade. Negligence is root cause for the threat: negligence to stop the local trade, to aware the local people.Creation of Protected areas is insufficient for the species as most of potential habitat lies outside the protected areas and it is often found near to human settlement; this increase the <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species.|$|R
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{significant}} and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season.

5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E

Another <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the lemurs is the agricultural practices of the local community.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how anorexia prevention campaign messages affect female college students through a linear relationship among magnitude of requests, perceived <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom, psychological reactance, attitude, and behavioral intention. A total of 163 female undergraduate {{students participated in}} an online survey and read four different fictional campaign messages (no request version, small request version, larger request version, and small and large request combined version) in terms of magnitude of requests regarding anorexia prevention. Five hypotheses were examined to measure participants 2 ̆ 7 level of reactance, <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom, attitudes, and behavioral intention. The findings revealed {{a significant relationship between}} magnitude of requests and <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom; i. e., more demanding requests in an anorexia prevention message can generate a higher level of <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom. In addition, there was a positive relationship between <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom and reactance; i. e., individuals who experienced a higher <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> freedom were more likely to experience stronger reactance whereas those who presented higher reactance exhibited a lower behavioral intention to follow anorexia prevention recommendations. Nevertheless, there was not a significant relationship between reactance and attitude toward anorexia prevention recommendations. Furthermore, no significant positive relationship was revealed between attitude toward anorexia prevention recommendations and behavioral intention to follow anorexia prevention recommendations...|$|R
