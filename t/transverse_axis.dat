25|$|In {{organisms that}} {{maintain}} a constant shape and have one dimension {{longer than the}} other, at least two directional terms can be used. The long or longitudinal axis is defined by points at the {{opposite ends of the}} organism. Similarly, a perpendicular <b>transverse</b> <b>axis</b> can be defined by points {{on opposite sides of the}} organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are planktonic (free-swimming) protists, and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present.|$|E
50|$|The elbow, {{like other}} joints, has ligaments on either side. These are {{triangular}} bands which blend with the joint capsule. They are positioned {{so that they}} always lie across the <b>transverse</b> joint <b>axis</b> and are, therefore, always relatively tense and impose strict limitations on abduction, adduction, and axial rotation at the elbow.|$|R

60|$|The {{occipital}} foramen (figure 10) presents some remarkable differences: in {{the wild}} rabbit, the lower edge between the condyles is considerably and almost angularly hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and squarely notched; hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the <b>transverse</b> <b>axis.</b> In the skulls of the lop-eared rabbits the <b>transverse</b> <b>axis</b> exceeds the longitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower edge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there was no upper square notch, in three there was a trace of the notch, and in two alone it was well developed. These differences {{in the shape of}} the foramen are remarkable, considering that it gives passage to so important a structure as the spinal marrow, though apparently the outline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage.|$|E

30|$|GV {{is a rare}} {{condition}} and Berti first described in 1866 [11]. GV {{is defined as a}} rotation of {{all or part of the}} stomach through more than 180 ° [1]. This rotation can happen on its longitudinal (organo-axial) or <b>transverse</b> (mesentero-axial) <b>axis.</b> This condition can cause a closed-loop obstruction or strangulation. The absence or loosening of gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments was reported to lead to GV [1]. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, para-oesophageal hernia, or wondering spleen are the main secondary causes of this condition [12, 13].|$|R
60|$|General Appearance.--Shape, flask-like, {{compressed}} (Pl. V, fig. 9, magnified 36 times), {{with a short}} neck: {{the outline}} is usually symmetrical, but sometimes is a little distorted on the under side. The creature is imbedded {{more than half its}} length or depth in the transparent, spine-bearing chitine border of the scutum of the hermaphrodite. Its length, or longer axis, varies from 10 to 11/400ths; its breadth, or <b>transverse</b> <b>axis,</b> is 6 to 7/400ths; and its thickness, for it is much flattened, is only 4/400ths of an inch. On the summit, there is a fimbriated orifice (a), the size of which can rarely be made out quite distinctly, owing to the extreme thinness of the membranous edges. A little way beneath the orifice, there are four little blunt, bristly points (b), generally rather more than the 1/1000th of an inch in length; they are rather variable in size, and seem to be of no functional importance; directly beneath them, there are four little calcareous beads (as may be known by their dissolving with effervescence in any acid, and breaking easily under the needle); these are the 3/2000ths of an inch in their larger external diameter; they are rather deeply imbedded in the outer integument, and taper a little downwards ending in a concave terminal point, into which a minute tubulus enters, like those passing into and through the valves of ordinary Cirripedia: along the axis of imbedment, they are often 4/2000ths of an inch in length. These calcareous beads or rudimental valves are seated in pairs, at the two ends of the flattened animal, so that when the animal is laid on one side, the upper bead in each pair exactly covers and hides the lower one. The outer integument is composed of chitine, as may be inferred from boiling caustic potash having no effect on it; the upper part is thicker than the imbedded portion and is wrinkled transversely; it is covered with minute spines 4/10,000ths of an inch in length, either single or in groups of two and three, (Pl. V, fig. 14.) This outer tunic is lined by corium, sometimes slightly mottled with dull purple; and this by delicate, longitudinal, striæ-less muscles, running from the base up to the under edge of the orifice; these longitudinal muscles are crossed, at least, in the upper part, by still finer transverse muscles.|$|E
