5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|Many {{improvements}} to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. In 1985, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act led {{to a reduction in}} capacity from 18,000 to 8,000. The Kop End was closed, and the Main Stand capacity was reduced by 3,000, because there were insufficient access points. £50,000 was spent on safety work to maintain a capacity of 8,000, and the club were unable to afford any further refurbishment. But <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created– the Borough Road Stand, the Cowshed and the new Kop. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,587 of today.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the yearly}} {{changes in the}} route, race length, and number of stages, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> to the how the general {{classification}} was to be calculated. The organizers chose to make the general classification centered around teams rather than individuals like the race was contested {{in the first three}} years of its existence. They chose to only allow teams of four riders to compete in the race, making this the first Giro d'Italia to not contain any independent riders. Each team was required to have three riders finish each stage in order to remain in the race. The general classification was still determined by a point system: four points went to the team that the stage winner came from, if a team got two riders in the top four placings on a stage they got two points, and if a team completed the stage with the minimum three riders, they earned one point.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, Belgium began {{a period of}} rapid {{economic}} recovery {{and the process of}} political reconstruction began. The traditional party system had been torn apart by the war and occupation. The two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties: socialists created the Belgian Socialist Party (PSB–BSP), while Catholics and conservatives created the Christian Social Party (PSC–CVP). <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> in early post-liberation politics was the surge of support for the Communist Party of Belgium, which become the third party in Belgian politics until 1949, temporarily displacing the Liberal Party. The Walloon Movement also re-emerged after the war, promoting the culture and economic interests of the French-speaking areas in the south. The period saw major reform of trade unions following the creation of the first large unified union, the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB–ABVV), in April 1945 with 248,000 members nationwide. By 1947, however, the political structure of the Belgian state had stabilised.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{initially}} did {{not significantly}} alter {{the operation of the}} manor or the village economy. William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> in the years after the invasion was the rapid {{reduction in the number of}} slaves being held in England. In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous, although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure. Nonetheless, the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords. The wealthier, formerly more independent Anglo-Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree workers, or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor and seek alternative employment. Those Anglo-Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed.|$|E
5|$|The PC {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Asia in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports {{the use of a}} keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The PC version is simply labelled Metal Gear Solid on the packaging, but the actual game uses the Metal Gear Solid: Integral logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus eliminating the need for a stand-alone third disc.|$|E

5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff did see some changes. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> came at the offensive coordinator position. Former offensive coordinator Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive coordinator after previously serving as the co-offensive coordinator along with Long as well as the offensive line coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a graduate assistant before taking a position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive coordinator with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
25|$|The season's main {{transfer}} dealing involved Tommy Hutchison, {{who left}} for Coventry City, with Billy Rafferty {{going in the}} opposite direction. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change,</b> however, came in the manager's office when Bob Stokoe left in November for Sunderland in his native North-East.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>change</b> {{occurs with}} <b>the</b> {{arrival of the}} first train Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires on December 24 of 1870. The city of Marcos Paz was created on October 25 of 1878.|$|R

25|$|In June 2005, Funkstörung {{released}} another album called The Return to the Acid Planet {{to celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of their first release. Stylistically, it was very reminiscent of their Acid Planet work – indeed, most of the songs were from that time, and were touched up to modern production standards. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> was replacing the standard straight acid house beats with 808-sounding breakbeats. The album was only released in a limited vinyl edition and in the iTunes Music Store.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> to Blackheath {{resulted}} from extensive mineral extraction in the 18th and early 19th centuries, when gravel, sand and chalk were extracted. This left large pits on {{many parts of}} the heath. In 1945, pits were filled in with bomb rubble from World War II, then covered with topsoil and seeded with rye grass, leaving only Vanbrugh Pits to the north-east side and Eliot Pits in the south-west. Infilled areas can be spotted easily, especially in late spring and early summer, because of the deeper green colour of the rye grass.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Dr. Jon Woods {{commissioned}} <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>changes</b> to <b>the</b> OSUMB uniform. The Fechheimer Bros. also constructed these uniforms. Everything visible {{was changed}} to some extent. These uniforms debuted for the homecoming game against Purdue in 1988.|$|R
50|$|In view {{of whole}} Berlin, Marzahn-Hellersdorf shows <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>changes</b> {{concerning}} demography. In 1991 {{the average age}} of the two boroughs reached a number of 30,5 years which increased to 39,6 years due to the migration of the younger people.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>change</b> is that Billy is {{not being}} <b>the</b> <b>big</b> 'I do this—I do that'. It's much better.

25|$|During the Speaker's term, teacher benefit {{reforms were}} also accomplished. The legislation, which is {{described}} as <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> in the state's teacher retirement system in a generation, allows school districts to allocate less towards retirement pensions and more towards students. School district leaders have noted the change to retirement pension requirements have been a blessing, saying the separation allows school districts to spend more on school operations. The reform also created the option for teachers to commit more towards their own retirement, or have the option for a smaller pension.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> to {{the county}} came in the 19th century, when a {{combination}} of cholera and famine hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap {{at a time when}} the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} and quest {{structure of}} Heavensward largely match {{that of its}} base game. As with many MMORPGs, players {{interact with each other}} in a persistent world that responds to their actions. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> to the combat is an increase of the level cap to level 60, which allows each fighting class to learn five new abilities that significantly modify the flow of battle. Three new job classes are introduced as well—the abyssal tank Dark Knight, the gun-toting Machinist, and the star-powered healer Astrologian. These jobs begin at level 30 with their own storylines connected to the new setting.|$|E

25|$|By far <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> for league clubs {{during this}} era {{was a new}} cup {{competition}} open to {{all the members of}} the League, the Football League Cup, which was held for the first time in 1960–61 to provide clubs with a new source of income. Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of some other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.|$|E
25|$|Fuck the Facts has {{had three}} {{different}} vocalists, all {{with their own}} style and impact on {{the sound of the}} band. The first recordings up until Discoing the Dead feature only Topon on vocals (aside from a few guest appearances). His singing varies between deep growls and more high pitched screams. The Mullet Fever lineup features Brent Christoff who has a slightly deeper, more grunting sound. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> is with the replacement of Brent with Mel Mongeon who has a very distinctive high-pitched shriek which has become the vocal style that the band is most known for.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{the school}} moved towards {{computerization}} and renovations occurred around the campus. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>change</b> during this era {{was the creation}} of an on-campus parking lot and the closure of Bancroft Street, which previously divided the campus into two separate sections. In 1997, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary. The school continues to grow in the new millennium, and is embarking on an extensive building campaign which calls for most of the school being demolished and rebuilt to meet modern standards of building codes and architectural tastes. The school will also feature the latest in technology made readily available to its students and faculty.|$|E
