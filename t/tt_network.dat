Reduced state subsidies reduced schedules throughout the <b>TT</b> <b>network</b> in 1982, and again in 1983. Ridership declined 13.7% in 1982, to 12.7 million, while the tram had 4.3 million. The support for the tram among the tram-friendly parties started declining in the early 1980s. Both the Labour, Liberal and Socialist Left Party had several members who became opposed to tram operations. On 26 November 1981, the city council decided to consider {{reducing the number of}} trams to eleven, and close line 2, from Voldsminde to Elgeseter. To save the line, Ulf Ulseth suggested using the old stock on line 2.|$|E
40|$|International audience: Loss of T-tubules (TT), sarcolemmal invaginations of cardiomyocytes (CMs), was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} general heart failure (HF) hallmark. However, whether TT per se or the overall sarcolemma is altered during HF process is still unknown. In this study, we directly examined sarcolemmal surface topography and physical properties using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in living CMs from healthy and failing mice hearts. We confirmed the presence of highly organized crests and hollows along myofilaments in isolated healthy CMs. Sarcolemma topography was tightly correlated with elasticity, with crests stiffer than hollows and related {{to the presence of}} few packed subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) as evidenced by electron microscopy. Three days after myocardial infarction (MI), CMs already exhibit an overall sarcolemma disorganization with general loss of crests topography thus becoming smooth and correlating with a decreased elasticity while interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), myofilaments alignment and <b>TT</b> <b>network</b> were unaltered. End-stage post-ischemic condition (15 days post-MI) exacerbates overall sarcolemma disorganization with, in addition to general loss of crest/hollow periodicity, a significant increase of cell surface stiffness. Strikingly, electron microscopy revealed the total depletion of SSM while some IFM heaps could be visualized beneath the membrane. Accordingly, mitochondrial Ca(2 +) studies showed a heterogeneous pattern between SSM and IFM in healthy CMs which disappeared in HF. In vitro, formamide-induced sarcolemmal stress on healthy CMs phenocopied post-ischemic kinetics abnormalities and revealed initial SSM death and crest/hollow disorganization followed by IFM later disarray which moved toward the cell surface and structured heaps correlating with TT loss. This study demonstrates that the loss of crest/hollow organization of CM surface in HF occurs early and precedes disruption of the <b>TT</b> <b>network.</b> It also highlights a general stiffness increased of the CM surface most likely related to atypical IFM heaps while SSM died during HF process. Overall, these results indicate that initial sarcolemmal stress leading to SSM death could underlie subsequent TT disarray and HF setting...|$|E

They were {{prepared}} by direct synthesis in an induction furnace and subsequently annealed at 500 °C.

40|$|In modern {{networked}} control applications, {{confidentiality and}} integrity are important features to address {{in order to}} prevent against attacks. Moreover, network control systems are a fundamental part of the communication components of current cyber-physical systems (e. g., automotive communications). Many networked control systems employ Time-Triggered (TT) architectures that provide mechanisms enabling the exchange of precise and synchronous messages. TT systems have computation and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) to <b>TT</b> <b>networked</b> control systems. The contributions of the paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing automotive controller execution times. The methods and results of the paper can be used for evaluating the performance impact of security mechanisms and, thus, for the design of secure wired and wireless <b>TT</b> <b>networked</b> control systems...|$|R
40|$|Tensor train (TT) {{decomposition}} is {{a powerful}} representation for high-order tensors, which has been successfully applied to various machine learning tasks in recent years. However, since the tensor product is not commutative, permutation of data dimensions makes solutions and TT-ranks of TT decomposition inconsistent. To alleviate this problem, we propose a permutation symmetric network structure by employing circular multilinear products over a sequence of low-order core tensors. This network structure can be graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of tensors, and thus we call it tensor ring (TR) representation. We develop several efficient algorithms to learn TR representation with adaptive TR-ranks by employing low-rank approximations. Furthermore, mathematical properties are investigated, which enables us to perform basic operations in a computationally efficiently way by using TR representations. Experimental results on synthetic signals and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TR network is more expressive and consistently informative than existing <b>TT</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1606. 0553...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Transverse tubules (TTs) couple {{electric}} surface {{signals to}} remote intracellular Ca 2 + release units (CRUs). Diffraction-limited imaging studies have proposed loss of TT components as disease mechanism in heart failure (HF). Objectives: Objectives were to develop quantitative super-resolution strategies for live-cell imaging of TT membranes in intact cardiomyocytes {{and to show}} that TT structures are progressively remodeled during HF development, causing early CRU dysfunction. Methods and Results: Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we characterized individual TTs with nanometric resolution as direct readout of local membrane morphology 4 and 8 weeks after myocardial infarction (4 pMI and 8 pMI). Both individual and <b>network</b> <b>TT</b> properties were investigated by quantitative image analysis. The mean area of TT cross sections increased progressively from 4 pMI to 8 pMI. Unexpectedly, intact <b>TT</b> <b>networks</b> showed differential changes. Longitudinal and oblique TTs were significantly increased at 4 pMI, whereas transversal components appeared decreased. Expression of TT-associated proteins junctophilin- 2 and caveolin- 3 was significantly changed, correlating with network component remodeling. Computational modeling of spatial changes in HF through heterogeneous TT reorganization and RyR 2 orphaning (5000 of 20 000 CRUs) uncovered a local mechanism of delayed subcellular Ca 2 + release and action potential prolongation. Conclusions: This study introduces STED nanoscopy for live mapping of TT membrane structures. During early HF development, the local TT morphology and associated proteins were significantly altered, leading to differential network remodeling and Ca 2 + release dyssynchrony. Our data suggest that TT remodeling during HF development involves proliferative membrane changes, early excitation-contraction uncoupling, and network fracturing...|$|R

40|$|Mindreading, or {{attributing}} mental {{states to}} others, involves instances of simulation and theory; {{but there is}} controversy over which one of these methods is the primary, or default, mechanism. I propose that mindreading is a theory-based process, such that we utilize theory over simulation when both are available and reliable. To argue my position, I suggest that theory has been inaccurately portrayed in past discussion and that we possess two types: a connectionist <b>network</b> (<b>tt</b> 1) and a traditional, conceptual folk-psychology (tt 2). By dividing theory in this way, we can explain common phenomena of mindreading that other theory-based accounts do not explicitly imply. Previously used as evidence for a simulation-based model, these phenomena are now compatible with a Dual Type Theory Account. Additionally, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 theory invites a new argument for primacy by appealing to the cognitive resources required by a mechanism, such that the primary method {{will be the one}} that requires the least amount of effort and is available in every case. Since tt 1 is effortless and automatic, it is likely the default process. Tt 1 provides us with a modular, fast, unconscious mindreading tool that is not dependent on conceptual knowledge, yet it can be influenced and adjusted by tt 2 via supervised learning...|$|R
40|$|Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is an {{international}} standard technique for video compression. It {{is an extension of}} H. 264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC). In the encoding of video streams by SVC, it is suitable to employ the macroblock (MB) mode because it affords superior coding efficiency. However, the exhaustive mode decision technique that is usually used for SVC increases the computational complexity, resulting in a longer encoding time (ET). Many other algorithms were proposed to solve this problem with imperfection of increasing transmission time (<b>TT)</b> across the <b>network.</b> To minimize the ET and TT, this paper introduces four efficient algorithms based on spatial scalability. The algorithms utilize the mode-distribution correlation between the base layer (BL) and enhancement layers (ELs) and interpolation between the EL frames. The proposed algorithms are of two categories. Those of the first category are based on interlayer residual SVC spatial scalability. They employ two methods, namely, interlayer interpolation (ILIP) and the interlayer base mode (ILBM) method, and enable ET and TT savings of up to 69. 3 % and 83. 6 %, respectively. The algorithms of the second category are based on full-search SVC spatial scalability. They utilize two methods, namely, full interpolation (FIP) and the full-base mode (FBM) method, and enable ET and TT savings of up to 55. 3 % and 76. 6 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Aerospace {{projects}} have traditionally employed federated avionics architectures, {{in which each}} computer system is designed to perform one specific function (e. g. navigation). There are obvious downsides to this approach, including excessive weight (from so much computing hardware), and inefficient processor utilization (since modern processors are capable of performing multiple tasks). There has therefore been a push for integrated modular avionics (IMA), in which common computing platforms can be leveraged for different purposes. This consolidation of multiple vehicle functions to shared computing platforms can significantly reduce spacecraft cost, weight, and design complexity. However, the application of IMA principles introduces significant challenges, as the data network must accommodate traffic of mixed criticality and performance levels - potentially all related to the same shared computer hardware. Because individual network technologies are rarely so competent, the development of truly integrated network architectures often proves unreasonable. Several different types of networks are utilized - each suited to support a specific vehicle function. Critical functions are typically driven by precise timing loops, requiring networks with strict guarantees regarding message latency (i. e. determinism) and fault-tolerance. Alternatively, non-critical systems generally employ data networks prioritizing flexibility and high performance over reliable operation. Switched Ethernet has seen widespread success filling this role in terrestrial applications. Its high speed, flexibility, {{and the availability of}} inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components make it desirable for inclusion in spacecraft platforms. Basic Ethernet configurations have been incorporated into several preexisting aerospace projects, including both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS). However, classical switched Ethernet cannot provide the high level of network determinism required by real-time spacecraft applications. Even with modern advancements, the uncoordinated (i. e. event-driven) nature of Ethernet communication unavoidably leads to message contention within network switches. The arbitration process used to resolve such conflicts introduces variation {{in the time it takes}} for messages to be forwarded. TTEthernet 1 introduces decentralized clock synchronization to switched Ethernet, enabling message transmission according to a time-triggered (<b>TT)</b> paradigm. A <b>network</b> planning tool is used to allocate each device a finite amount of time in which it may transmit a frame. Each time slot is repeated sequentially to form a periodic communication schedule that is then loaded onto each TTEthernet device (e. g. switches and end systems). Each network participant references the synchronized time in order to dispatch messages at predetermined instances. This schedule guarantees that no contention exists between time-triggered Ethernet frames in the network switches, therefore eliminating the need for arbitration (and the timing variation it causes). Besides time-triggered messaging, TTEthernet networks may provide two additional traffic classes to support communication of different criticality levels. In the rate-constrained (RC) traffic class, the frame payload size and rate of transmission along each communication channel are limited to predetermined maximums. The network switches can therefore be configured to accommodate the known worst-case traffic pattern, and buffer overflows can be eliminated. The best-effort (BE) traffic class behaves akin to classical Ethernet. No guarantees are provided regarding transmission latency or successful message delivery. TTEthernet coordinates transmission of all three traffic classes over the same physical connections, therefore accommodating the full spectrum of traffic criticality levels required in IMA architectures. Common computing platforms (e. g. LRUs) can share networking resources in such a way that failures in non-critical systems (using BE or RC communication modes) cannot impact flight-critical functions (using TT communication). Furthermore, TTEthernet hardware (e. g. switches, cabling) can be shared by both TTEthernet and classical Ethernet traffic...|$|R
