5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; {{the first is a}} cart with fixed seats and the second is a cart where the driver stands above <b>the</b> <b>axle.</b> The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>axles</b> are {{manufactured}} by American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. The front is an AAM 9.25 and the rear is a hybrid AAM 10.5 with <b>the</b> larger <b>axle</b> shafts from <b>the</b> AAM 11.5. Despite <b>the</b> fact <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> have locking differentials, <b>the</b> rear <b>axle</b> {{is also a}} helical-type limited slip differential when unlocked. <b>The</b> <b>axles</b> are only available with a 4.56:1 gear ratio. Non Power Wagon 2500 Ram trucks only have 3.42:1, 3.73:1, or 4.10:1 gear ratios. 2010 models (along with other Ram trucks) received larger universal joints.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>axles</b> are {{produced}} by Sisu <b>Axles.</b> <b>The</b> steering front <b>axles</b> are type FSND-10-P with maximum ten tonnes capacity and disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{foremost}} <b>axle</b> on <b>the</b> tandem <b>axle</b> is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% of {{the weight}} lying on <b>the</b> tandem <b>axle.</b> <b>The</b> rear, non-driven <b>axle,</b> is linked to <b>the</b> driven <b>axle</b> through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to <b>the</b> rear <b>axle</b> is increased, <b>the</b> mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from <b>the</b> non-driven <b>axle</b> to <b>the</b> driven <b>axle,</b> improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more {{of the weight}} can be moved to <b>the</b> driven <b>axle</b> manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and tyre wear <b>the</b> non-driven rear <b>axle</b> can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two <b>axles</b> also reduces <b>the</b> K-44's turning circle.|$|R
5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly <b>the</b> <b>axle),</b> inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of produce to Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> load. During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed centralized traffic control by 2023.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on <b>the</b> <b>axle,</b> so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
5000|$|All four <b>axles</b> of <b>the</b> {{locomotives}} - even <b>the</b> carrying <b>axles</b> - {{were more}} or less equally loaded with a hefty 16 tonnes. <b>The</b> carrying <b>axle</b> was linked to <b>the</b> first coupled <b>axle</b> via a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. <b>The</b> <b>axles</b> were located in a plate frame, inside which a well tank was rivetted.|$|R
50|$|The main {{notation}}s are the Whyte notation (based on {{counting the}} wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> or <b>the</b> bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements (based on counting either <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> or <b>the</b> bogies).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>axles</b> {{was similar}} to those of the CD650, <b>the</b> rear <b>axle</b> being a {{substantial}} underslung worm unit, with the differential offset to the left.|$|R
5|$|The next {{race was}} the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth {{early in the}} race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver Baconin Borzacchini pitted for a wheel change and <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> on Achille Varzi's Bugatti broke. Tazio Nuvolari, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps {{remaining}} in the race Caracciola was so close he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, {{on the strength of}} his performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the {{concession}} for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen–Hardanger–Voss Billag. At the same time, {{the number of}} weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely {{a result of the}} 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line. In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers. A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. Freight transport was retained, at first using El9, and later shunting locomotives {{because of the lack of}} maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> load to be increased. Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Klien-Lindner <b>axle</b> uses a double, or hollow, <b>axle,</b> one inside <b>the</b> other. It has {{a hollow}} <b>axle</b> (Hohlachse) on <b>the</b> outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a Cardan joint to a fixed driving axle running through it. The Cardan joint comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on <b>the</b> fixed <b>axle</b> and a hollow one on <b>the</b> outer hollow <b>axle,</b> each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from <b>the</b> rigid <b>axle</b> to <b>the</b> hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way <b>the</b> hollow <b>axle</b> can be turned by <b>the</b> fixed <b>axle.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> connecting link is shaped so that <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which <b>the</b> hollow <b>axle</b> can swivel is set by the outer diameter of <b>the</b> fixed <b>axle</b> and <b>the</b> internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} point of contact lies on the line {{connecting}} <b>the</b> <b>axles,</b> {{in order for the}} gears to touch without slipping, the velocity of each wheel must be equal at the point of contact and perpendicular to the line connecting <b>the</b> <b>axles,</b> which implies that: ...|$|R

5|$|On 23 June, Quale {{stated that}} the inspectorate should never have {{approved}} the trains. He {{stated that the}} Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology, a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB stated that all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
25|$|The {{wheel is}} usually {{similar to a}} bicycle wheel with a special hub {{designed}} so <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> is a fixed part of the hub. This means {{the rotation of the}} cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> bearings, while the cranks attach to the ends of <b>the</b> <b>axle,</b> and the seatpost slides into the frame to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.|$|E

50|$|The 'A' and 'D' {{designation}} is {{from the}} designation of <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> on <b>the</b> two bogies. The 'A' end car has <b>the</b> 'A' <b>axle</b> at <b>the</b> driving cab end of the car with <b>the</b> 'B' <b>axle</b> on <b>the</b> {{opposite end of the}} same bogie. <b>The</b> 'C' <b>axle</b> on <b>the</b> second bogie is nearest the driving cab with <b>the</b> 'D' <b>axle</b> closest to <b>the</b> coupled trailer car. The sequence is reversed on the 'D' end motor car. This is also why the alternate car is not designated the logically more obvious 'B' end.|$|R

50|$|Compared to the {{production}} BMW E90 model, <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> and <b>the</b> suspension geometry has been changed significantly. <b>The</b> new <b>axles</b> design include a camber setting that could be adjusted independently of any other settings parameters, such as roll center and track. This would make <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> easier for semi-professional teams to set up. The track width and camber were increased, while the wheel carrier and bearing were carried over from {{the production}} model.|$|R

25|$|The {{explanation}} of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a simpler physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See inertial frame for more detail.|$|E
