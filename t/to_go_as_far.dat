5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed {{spoke for}} a liberal {{faction of the}} Whigs in his {{newspaper}} the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley {{as editor of the}} state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> west as Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The IND Fulton Street Line {{would get}} an eastward extension; it would first be {{extended}} to 106th Street as a four-track line, where it would connect to the IND Rockaway Line. Afterwards, the line would stretch along Linden Boulevard to 229th Street in Eastern Queens. The line {{was to go to}} a two-track terminal at 105th or 106th Streets, with intermediate stops at 75th or 76th Streets and at 84th or 85th Streets (both proposed local stops), as well as at Cross Bay Boulevard (a proposed express stop). In 1951, these relay tracks were still planned <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as 105th Street, with a connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Cross Bay Boulevard. In May 2004, this idea resurfaced, with an attached track map drawn up. If the line were ever built, Pitkin Avenue would have been routed to the east rather than to the southeast at 80th Street, and Linden Boulevard between Conduit and Rockaway Boulevards would have been built to facilitate the line.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend farther along Hillside Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of Hillside, Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. Hillside Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via Hillside Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from another {{something}} worth a perutah (the minimum amount of significant value) and the thief nonetheless swore that the thief did not do so, the thief was obliged to take restitution to the victim even if the thief needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Media (in what is now Iran). The thief could not give restitution to the victim's son or agent, but the thief could give it to {{an agent of the}} court.

25|$|In 1910, {{a number}} of coal miners in the Rhondda Valley began {{what has come to}} be known as the Tonypandy Riot. The Chief Constable of Glamorgan {{requested}} troops be sent in to help police quell the rioting. Churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Swindon and Cardiff, but blocked their deployment. On 9 November, The Times criticised this decision. In spite of this, the rumour persists that Churchill had ordered troops to attack, and his reputation in Wales and in Labour circles never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia's {{national}} petroleum company Petronas owns {{a railway}} line which links its oil refinery complex {{and the nearby}} town of Kerteh, Terengganu, with the petrochemical complex in Gebeng, Kuantan, and Kuantan Port near Kuantan, Pahang. The line is mainly used to transport petroleum products, but it has been opened up recently for general freight transport, with operation being conducted by KTM. There have been proposals to extend the line to connect with the KTM line at Mentakab, and there are suggestions <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Kuala Terengganu and Tumpat.|$|E

25|$|Back at the Red River District, HBC trader Peter Fidler {{arrived at}} Lake Manitoba with a cargo of trade goods on September 4. NWC clerk Seraphim Lamarre {{gathered}} a small force of Métis to assault Fidler, but finding that Fidler’s party was too large {{and under the}} protection of local Indians, Lamarre retreated to Fort Douglas. Alexander Macdonell reinforced Lamarre with 12 or 15 more Métis and Lamarre successfully plundered Fidler’s goods in late September. On September 5, the Nor’Westers at Red River learned of Selkirk’s capture of Fort William, Alexander Macdonell, Archibald Mclellan and Cuthbert Grant met at Bas de la Rivière and proposed to raise a force to retake it, but the Métis refused on account of Selkirk being accompanied by government soldiers, instead the Métis decided to stay and defend the Red River colony. Mclellan then departed for Fort William with a small force of voyageurs and two Métis who agreed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Lac la Pluie. With Lac la Pluie in his control, Captain D’Orsonnes and a party of 28 Du Meuron soldiers with two cannons went out on snow shoes and sledges to recapture the Red River Colony. In 40 days they reached Pembina and seized it. Hearing rumours that Fort Douglas was only held by a handful of men, D’Orsonnes moved to retake it. He encamped 10 miles south of Fort Douglas in a dense wood and built scaling ladders for a night attack.|$|E

[...] Le Faye writes that, [...] "Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified.

500|$|The film {{is based}} on a 19th-century Russian folktale, which Joe Ranft {{introduced}} to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: [...] "In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the emotional tone and story points to hit.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the third}} season of Ellen, {{producers}} were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom tropes of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she should get a puppy. [...] "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll. It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea to give that working title to the episode, and it stuck. In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, Disney, to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out. The LGBT media watchdog group Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) launched a [...] "Let Ellen Out!" [...] campaign, including an [...] "Ellen Watch" [...] website. Disney rejected the first draft of the script, with Disney executive Dean Valentine stating that it did not go far enough. Director Junger reported that Valentine said [...] "'If we're going to do it, let's do it.' Once he said <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as we could, it became great fun to write." [...] Once final approval from Disney was secured, ABC announced on March 3, 1997, that Ellen Morgan would be coming out. [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] went into production on March 7. Guest stars sought to be a part of the project. According to writer/producer Driscoll, [...] "Suddenly all these talented actors were lining up to be in the episode. It had a buzz around it that it would be an historic episode. When Oprah came on—and she was so wonderful and open and giving—it suddenly had this great weight to it." ...|$|E
