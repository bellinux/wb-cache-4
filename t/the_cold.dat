5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> War {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. <b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> War defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). <b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E

5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more central role in <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia.

5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, during <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland {{into the region}} due to a southward migration of the jet stream during <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
