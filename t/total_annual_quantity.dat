40|$|Palm oil {{is one of}} the {{important}} industrial sectors in Malaysia. Every year,the production of palm oil increased rapidly. As the production of palm oil increased, more palm oil mill effluent(POME) is generated annually. The <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of wastewater generated is estimated to be 1. 8 × 106 m 3. This situation contributed to more study on the technology of treatment of the POME. Raw POME comprises of water-soluble components of the palm fruits as well as some suspended materials like palm fibre and oil and it cannot be discharged into the watercourse directly. The effluent must be treated to acceptable quality before it can be discharged. Comparison on conventional system and alternative system for anaerobic treatment between ponding system and digestion tank treatment system was used for treatment POME. The resources of this data are taken from the selected Palm oil Mill Plantations. The main parameters for POME are BOD, COD, Suspended Solid,and Oil & Grease.

40|$|Discarding in commercially {{exploited}} fisheries {{has received}} considerable {{attention in the}} last decade, though only more recently in Australia. The Reef Line fishery (RLF) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia is a large-scale multi-sector, multi-species, highly regulated hook and line fishery {{with the potential for}} high levels of discarding. We used a range of data sources to estimate discard rates and discard quantities for the two main target groups of the RLF, the coral trout, Plectropomus spp, and the red throat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus, and investigated possible effects on discarding of recent changes in management of the fishery. Fleet-wide estimates of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantities</b> discarded from 1989 to 2003 were 292 – 622 t and 33 – 95 t for coral trout and red throat emperor, respectively. Hypothetical scenarios of high-grading after the introduction of a total allowable commercial catch for coral trout resulted in increases in discard quantities up to 3895 t, while no high-grading still meant 421 t were discarded. Increasing the minimum size limit of red throat emperor from 35 to 38 cm also increased discards to an estimated 103 t. We provide spatially and temporally explicit estimates of discarding for the two most important species in the GBR RLF of Australia to demonstrate the importance of accounting for regional variation in quantification of discarding. Effects of management changes on discarding are also highlighted. This study provides a template for exploring discarding levels for other species in the RLF and elsewhere. ...|$|R

The system calculates Finnish manures as a mass balance starting from animal feeding and excretion (excretion ex animal) and considering national manure management in housing (manure ex housing) and manure storage (manure ex storage). The system calculates manures for 74 animal categories in four manure types (slurry, farmyard manure, deep litter and source-separated dung and urine). The <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantities</b> of manure, dry matter, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are reported per animal and per animal place (t/year). Also, the content of dry matter, organic matter and nutrients in manures are reported (kg/t). The system quantifies national manure amounts and their nutrient contents. It also enables calculation of regional manures. In addition, the calculation of biological methane production potential was included to enable estimation of biogas production potential from manure nationally and regionally. The calculation system works well and the results reported can be used for various purposes in policymaking, regulation, emission inventories, research and development all aiming at enhanced manure utilisation. The system can still benefit from developing especially the quality of the background data used. The system was created in co-operation with Luke and SYKE during 2014 - 2017. Financing for the system development was received from Finnish Ministry of the Environment (main project) and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (additional work e. g. related to excretion calculation and background data collection).

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The association between airborne pollen counts or duration of pollen season and allergy symptoms {{is not always}} distinguished. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the correlation between pollen exposure (<b>annual</b> <b>total</b> pollen <b>quantity</b> and main pollen season length) of selected allergenic plants in the atmosphere of Bratislava, and concentration of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) in serum of patients with seasonal allergy during 2002 – 2003. Material and Methods The concentration of pollen was monitored by a Burkard volumetric pollen trap. At the same time, 198 pollen allergic patients were testing to determine the values of sIgE antibodies against selected pollen allergens; a panel of 8 purified allergens was used. Results The highest percentages of sensitization were detected for Poaceae and Ambrosia pollen allergens. The most abundant airborne pollen types were Urticaceae, Betula, Populus, Fraxinus, Pinus and Poaceae. The length of the pollen season varied. The longest pollen season was that of the Plantago – 105 days, and the shortest, Corylus – 20 days. A significant correlation was found between <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> pollen <b>quantity</b> and median sIgE values, especially in 2002. Conclusions A strong and significant positive correlation was observed between pollen counts, excluding Betula, and sIgE levels in both analysed years.

40|$|Though {{agriculture}} is the predominant occupation in Northern Ghana, {{the relationship between}} rainfall variability and crop production appears {{not to have been}} adequately investigated in the area. Crop production is largely characterized by smallholder subsistence farmers who depend solely on highly unpredictable and irregular seasonal rainfall. In recent times, rainfall variability has led to numerous incidences of drought and floods. This phenomenon has the potential to adversely affect crop production and food security in the area. This study analyses inter- and intra-annual variability of rainfall so as to identify the relationship between rainfall variability and crop production in a representative district of Northern Ghana. Available monthly rainfall data for 33 years (1980 - 2012) recorded at Babile station of the district was analyzed for seasonal and annual variability using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the precipitation concentration index (PCI). <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of crop production data on main crops (i. e. maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut and cowpea) was used. The available data covered a period of 21 years (1992 - 2012). To verify the influence of rainfall variability on crop production, correlation analysis was conducted. Although the results showed moderate seasonal rainfall distribution, (i. e. PCI> 11), the inter-seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variability (CV= 0. 19 and C= 0. 18 respectively) were moderate/less erratic. The results point to a negative correlation between annual rainfall and crop production for maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut and cowpea. At seasonal level sorghum, millet and groundnut showed negative correlation while maize and cowpea showed positive correlation. These results also point to a need for further studies to determine the influence of rainfall on arable land use and the periods of occurrence of drought in the study area. The results of this study would enable farmers to improve their crop production strategies...|$|E
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} roles of the brick making industries in Sudan in deforestation and greenhouse gas emission due to the consumption of biofuels. The results {{were based on the}} observation of 25 brick making industries from three administrative regions in Sudan namely, Khartoum, Kassala and Gezira. The methodological approach followed the procedures outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For predicting a serious deforestation scenario, it was also assumed that all of wood use for this particular purpose is from unsustainable sources. The study revealed that the <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of fuelwood consumed by the surveyed brick making industries (25) was 2, 381 t dm. Accordingly, the observed total potential deforested wood was 10, 624 m 3, in which the total deforested round wood was 3, 664 m 3 and deforested branches was 6, 961 m 3. The study observed that a total of 2, 990 t biomass fuels (fuelwood and dung cake) consumed annually by the surveyed brick making industries for brick burning. Consequently, estimated total annual emissions of greenhouse gases were 4, 832 t CO 2, 21 t CH 4, 184 t CO, 0. 15 t N 20, 5 t NOX and 3. 5 t NO while the total carbon released in the atmosphere was 1, 318 t. Altogether, the total annual greenhouse gases emissions from biomass fuels burning was 5, 046 t; of which 4, 104 t from fuelwood and 943 t from dung cake burning. According to the results, due to the consumption of fuelwood in the brick making industries (3, 450 units) of Sudan, the amount of wood lost from the total growing stock of wood in forests and trees in Sudan annually would be 1, 466, 000 m 3 encompassing 505, 000 m 3 round wood and 961, 000 m 3 branches annually. By considering all categories of biofuels (fuelwood and dung cake), it was estimated that, the total emissions from all the brick making industries of Sudan would be 663, 000 t CO 2, 2, 900 t CH 4, 25, 300 t CO, 20 t N 2 O, 720 t NOX and 470 t NO per annum, while the total carbon released in the atmosphere would be 181, 000 t annually...|$|E
40|$|We review {{studies that}} {{consider}} how food affects primate population abundance. In order to explain spatial variation in primate abundance, various correlates that parameterize {{quality and quantity}} of food in the habitat have been examined. We propose two hypotheses concerning how resource availability and its seasonality determine animal abundance. When the quality of fallback foods (foods eaten during the scarcity of preferred foods) is too low to satisfy nutritional requirement, <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> food <b>quantity</b> should determine population size, but this relationship can be modified by the quality or the quantity of fallback foods. This mechanism has been established for Japanese macaques and sportive lemurs that survive lean seasons by fat storage or extremely low metabolism. Second, when fallback food quality is high enough to satisfy nutritional requirement but quantity is limited, quantity of fallback food should be a limiting factor of animal abundance. This is supported by the correlation between fig density, which is a high-quality fallback food, and gibbon and orangutan abundance. For a direct test of these hypotheses, we need more research that determines both the quality of food that animals require to satisfy their nutritional requirement and the quantity of food production. Leaves are often regarded as superabundant, but this assumption needs careful examination...|$|R
40|$|Adoption of {{permanent}} cover crops and no-till systems is considered integral to achieving the California state {{air quality standards}} regulating airborne particulate matter, as indicated in Senate Bill 656. Imposition of such management techniques in a vineyard could create competition with vines for limited water resources. We evaluated the effects of cover crops that were either tilled or just mowed on vineyard floor composition, weed populations, vine water relations and growth, and fruit composition over three years within a mature commercial Merlot vineyard subjected to deficit irrigation in Lodi, San Joaquin Valley, California. The vineyard floor in this experiment supported resident vegetation that was tilled (standard grower practice), an oat cover crop, or a legume/oat cover crop. The two planted cover crops were either tilled or mowed (i. e., no-till). Biomass of cover crops, weeds, and legumes varied by year and treatment, but consistent effects among treatments were not observed. Weed species composition and cover segregated with {{the presence or absence}} of tillage rather than cover crop type and the weed species composition of the resident vegetation was distinct from those in the cover crop treatments. Some treatments, like 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill', 'Oats + NoTill', 'Oats/Legumes + Till', and 'Resident Vegetation + Till' reduced soil water content (circle minus(v)) in at least one of the three shallow soil layers spanning 0 to 30 cm, 30 to 60 cm, and 60 to 100 cm in 2008, and 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill' also dried the two upper layers in 2009, but these differences had no consistent influence on plant water status. Distinctions in circle minus(v) between years were attributed partly to the cessation of rainfall two months earlier in 2008 than in 2009, despite similar <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quantities.</b> Significant reductions in circle minus(v) imposed by the 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill' treatments reduced vine vegetative growth in two of three years, but these effects did not manifest in yield and fruit composition. Values for the Ravaz index for two of the three years indicate that the vineyard was overcropped for all treatments, but maximizing production in this region is a common practice. Weak competitive effects of the cover crops for water were likely associated with the use of a well-established mature vineyard and demonstrated that these management strategies could be employed to improve air quality to meet California air quality regulations with limited effects on vine water status and production.

Emphasis is placed on determining the onset {{and end of the}} rainy season, from which its length and rain rate are determined. It is shown that over large parts of the domain the onset and ending dates are well simulated by the model, with biases of less than 10 days. There is a tendency for model onset to occur early and ending to occur late, resulting in a simulated rainy season that is on average too long in many areas. The model wet season rain rate also tends to be larger than observed. To estimate the relative importance of errors in wet season length and rain rate in determining biases in the <b>annual</b> <b>total,</b> adjusted totals are computed by substituting both the observed climatological wet season length and rate for those of the model.

Methods: Patients completed a standardized questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel costs, meals, and productivity loss of patients when seeking treatment for IBS. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient were calculated as the sum of direct (including medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient among various IBS subtypes were compared. Analysis of variance and bootstrapped independent sample t -tests were performed to determine differences between groups after controlling for IBS subtypes. Results: A total of 105 IBS patients (64. 80 % female), mean age of 57. 12 years ± 10. 31 years), mean disease duration of 4. 31 years ± 5. 40 years, were included. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient were estimated as CNY 18262. 84 (USD 2933. 08). Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use were major cost drivers, accounting for 46. 41 %and 23. 36 % of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs, respectively. Productivity loss accounted for 25. 32 % of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs. The proportions of {{direct and indirect}} costs were similar to published studies in other countries.
