5|$|The {{city council}} voted {{in favour of}} {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. However, the decision did not include how the line would be financed, and the politicians stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> that the state would use national road funds to finance the project. This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company {{formed a}} {{football}} team, New Brighton Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> for and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, The Wachowskis {{were brought}} on board by {{the studio to}} write and direct the film. Producer Joel Silver, who had collaborated with the Wachowskis for V for Vendetta and The Matrix Trilogy, {{explained}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> to reach a broader audience with a film {{that would not be}} rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Visual effects designer John Gaeta, who won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for the Wachowskis' The Matrix, was brought in to help conceive making Speed Racer into a live-action adaptation. Production was set to begin in summer 2007 in European locations for a summer 2008 release. In November 2006, the release date for it was set for May 23, 2008. Producer Joel Silver described Speed Racer as a family film in line with the Wachowskis' goal to reach a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|When the Crypto Jews {{arrived on}} the island of Puerto Rico, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> to avoid {{religious}} scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to worship, the Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronica was {{confirmed}} {{to be in}} development as early as August 1998. Despite not being a numbered title, they still promoted it as the true sequel to Resident Evil 2. It was officially revealed on October 6, 1998 by Capcom R chief Yoshiki Okamoto. Capcom of Japan stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> to sell the game to roughly one third of all Dreamcast users, which they estimated would total to around one million copies. In July 1999, Capcom of Japan announced their shipment expectations for the Japanese Dreamcast version were at 400,000 copies. Journalists were skeptical if this was only the initial shipment, or evidence that Capcom overestimated sales of the Dreamcast, given their initial sales estimate was one million. Capcom initially planned to have Code: Veronica released {{around the same time}} as Resident Evil 3 and, more importantly, the Dreamcast launch in North America in late 1999. However, delays pushed the project back to early 2000. To make up for the game's absence, Capcom announced they would release a port of Resident Evil 2 for the Dreamcast that December. This release, called Biohazard 2: Value Plus, included a demo for Code: Veronica.|$|E

25|$|Seeking {{to expand}} their {{following}} outside Germany, the Puhdys recorded an English-language album, Far From Home in London with lyrical help provided by West German singer Wolfgang Michels. Consisting of re-recorded versions {{of some of their}} German hits, it failed to be the international breakthrough <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> for, although it gave the band a chance to perform one-off concerts in several countries including the United States to try to generate interest. Like City's English album Dreamland, recorded the previous year, it was hampered by Birr's and Hertrampf's thickly accented English, though it won greater acceptance in Germany. Interestingly, the Fern, fern, fern backing vocals on the title track, originally Fern von Zuhause, were left in the original language.|$|E

25|$|In a 1954 {{operation}} by Israeli military intelligence, {{known as}} the Lavon Affair after the defence minister Pinchas Lavon, a group of Zionist Egyptian Jews attempted to plant bombs in an US Information Service library, and {{in a number of}} American targets in Cairo and Alexandria. According to Teveth, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> that the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communists, 'unspecified malcontents' or 'local nationalists' would be blamed for their actions and this would undermine Western confidence in the existing Egyptian regime by generating public insecurity and actions to bring about arrests, demonstrations, and acts of revenge, while totally concealing the Israeli factor. The operation failed, the perpetrators were arrested by Egyptian police and brought to justice, two were sentenced to death, several to long term imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 1594 {{they set}} sail from Plymouth, {{heading for the}} Azores. En route they roamed the coast of Portugal and Spain, {{capturing}} a number of ships. Off Viana do Castelo, Portugal, a 28 tonne barque was captured as it headed towards Portuguese Angola. Near the islands of Berlengas another three Portuguese and Spanish caravels, were taken, one of which had twelve butts of Spanish wine and another a small chest of silver. These were sent back to England under prize crews aboard the Violet {{while the rest of}} the fleet continued towards the Azores. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> to avoid Alonso de Bazán's Spanish fleet which was on the lookout for Cumberland, after his failure to intercept him two years earlier.|$|E
25|$|The HBC {{built a new}} {{much larger}} Fort Vancouver in 1824 {{slightly}} upstream of Fort Astoria {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River (<b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> the Columbia would be the future Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.|$|E

25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Wang sent {{messengers}} issuing pardons {{in hopes}} of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital Chang'an, some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws {{made it impossible for}} them to make a living and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those who told the truth from their posts. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force. In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm. As a result, they never dared to attack cities.|$|E

Greece manager Otto Rehhagel had publicly urged Charisteas to try to move to another club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> to find a replacement for Swedish international striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, who had been sold to Juventus. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against FC Utrecht and scored his first goal four days later against SC Heerenveen. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005–06 season, which included a late winner against Vitesse Arnhem. Charisteas missed Greece's crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with Arsenal's Kolo Touré in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2–1.|$|E
