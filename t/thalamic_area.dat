40|$|Abstract Background The {{mechanism}} of aluminum-induced neurotoxicity is not clear. The involvement of glutamate in the aluminium-induced neurocomplications has been suggested. Brain glutamate levels {{also found to}} be altered in protein malnutrition. Alterations in glutamate levels as well as glutamate-α-decarboxylase in different regions of rat brain {{has been reported in}} response to aluminum exposure. Thus the study of glutamate metabolising enzymes in different brain regions of rats maintained on either normal or restricted protein diet may be of importance for understanding the neurotoxicity properties of aluminium. Results Dietary protein restrictions does not have an significant impact on regional aluminum content of the brain. The interaction of aluminum intoxication and protein restriction is significant in the <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> and the midbrain-hippocampal region in cases of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase. In the case of gluatmate pyruvate transaminase, this interaction is significant only in <b>thalamic</b> <b>area.</b> Conclusion The metabolism of amino acids, as indicated by activities of specific transaminases, of brain is altered in response to aluminum exposure. These alterations are region specific and are dependent on dietary protein intake or manipulation of the brain amino acid homeostasis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Central {{sensitization}} (CS) {{refers to}} an increase in the excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons that results from, and far outlasts the initiating nociceptive input. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine whether supraspinal activity might contribute to the maintenance of CS in humans. A crossover parametric design was used to distinguish and control for brain activity that is related to the consequence of increased pain experienced during CS. When the intensity of pain during CS and normal states were matched, only activity within the brainstem, including the mesencephalic pontine reticular formation, and the anterior thalami remained increased during CS. Further analyses revealed that activity in the isolated brainstem area correlated positively with the force of noxious stimulation only during CS, whereas activity in the isolated <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> was not modulated parametrically in either CS or normal states. Additionally, the mean activity in the isolated brainstem area was increased only during CS, whereas the mean activity in the isolated <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> was increased in both states, albeit less so in the normal state. Together, these findings suggest a specific role of the brainstem for the maintenance of CS in humans. Regarding brain areas related to the consequence of increased pain perception during CS, we found that only cortical activity, mainly in the primary somatosensory area, was significantly correlated with intensity of pain that was attributable to both the force of noxious stimulation used and state in which noxious stimulation was applied...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Propofol is {{commonly}} used as sedative in newborns and children. Recent experimental studies led to contradictory results, revealing neurodegenerative or neuroprotective properties of propofol on the developing brain. We investigated neurodevelopmental short- and long-term effects of neonatal propofol treatment. METHODS: 6 -day-old Wistar rats (P 6), randomised in two groups, received repeated intraperitoneal injections (0, 90, 180 min) of 30 mg/kg propofol or normal saline and sacrificed 6, 12 and 24 hrs following the first injection. Cortical and <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas</b> were analysed by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for expression of apoptotic and neurotrophin-dependent signalling pathways. Long-term effects were assessed by Open-field and Novel-Object-Recognition at P 30 and P 120. RESULTS: Western blot analyses revealed a transient increase of activated caspase- 3 in cortical, and a reduction of active mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK 1 / 2, AKT) in cortical and <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas.</b> qRT-PCR analyses showed a down-regulation of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF, NT- 3) in cortical and thalamic regions. Minor impairment in locomotive activity was observed in propofol treated adolescent animals at P 30. Memory or anxiety were not impaired at any time point. CONCLUSION: Exposing the neonatal rat brain to propofol induces acute neurotrophic imbalance and neuroapoptosis in a region- and time-specific manner and minor behavioural changes in adolescent animals...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{autoradiography}} {{shows that}} there is a close relationship between [3 H]imipramine binding sites and the distribution of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) neurons in the rat brain.

Thus, antidepressant drugs that have high affinity for [3 H]imipramine binding sites can exert an influence at the 5 -HT cell body {{as well as at the}} 5 -HT nerve terminal level. The present results underline the possibility that the 5 -HT and dopamine hypotheses for the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs are not mutually exclusive, because both 5 -HT and dopamine neurons can be regulated by large numbers of [3 H]imipramine binding sites...|$|E

40|$|Mouse {{whiskers}} are somatotopically mapped in brainstem trigeminal nuclei as neuronal modules {{known as}} barrelettes. Whisker-related afferents form barrelettes in ventral principal sensory (vPrV) nucleus, whereas mandibular input targets dorsal PrV (dPrV). How barrelette neuron identity and circuitry is established is poorly understood. We found that ectopic Hoxa 2 expression in dPrV neurons {{is sufficient to}} attract whisker-related afferents, induce asymmetrical dendrite arbors, and allow ectopic barrelette map formation. Moreover, the <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> forming whisker-related barreloids is prenatally targeted by both vPrV and dPrV axons followed by perinatal large-scale pruning of dPrV axons and refinement of vPrV barrelette input. Ectopic Hoxa 2 expression allows topographically directed targeting and refinement of dPrV axons with vPrV axons into a single whisker-related barreloid map. Thus, a single HOX transcription factor is sufficient to switch dPrV into a vPrV barrelette neuron program and coordinate input-output topographic connectivity of a dermatome-specific circuit module...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] In awake monkeys, we used {{repetitive}} {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (rTMS) to focally inactivate {{visual cortex}} while measuring the responsiveness of parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. Effects were noted in 64 / 75 neurons, and could be divided into 2 main groups: (1) for 39 neurons, visual responsiveness decreased and visual latency increased without apparent shift in receptive field (RF) position and (2) a second group (n = 25, 33 % of the recorded cells) whose excitability was not compromised, but whose RF position shifted an average of 4. 5 °. This change {{is related to the}} retinotopic correspondence observed between the recorded <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> and the affected cortical zone. The effect of inactivation for this group of neurons was compatible with silencing the original retinal drive and unmasking a second latent retinal drive onto the studied neuron.

Although a parenteral support was provided, he developed acute encephalopathy followed by hypotension and lactic acidosis without evidence of renal and hepatic disease or glycemic alterations. Likewise, no cerebral CT and cerebrospinal fluid alterations were found. Conversely, cerebral MRI showed marked and diffuse DP- 2 and FLAIR hyperintensity of the mesencephalic tectal plate, of the periaqueductal area, and of the periventricular region of the third ventricle including the median <b>thalamic</b> <b>area.</b> These MRI descriptions were considered pathognomonic of Wernicke encephalopathy.

A striking inconsistency existed between the complaints of limb anaesthesia and the grossly preserved motor and postural control of the involved limb. The gross discrepancy between complaint and functional ability prompted early consideration of a "non-organic " diagnosis. It is suggested that this unusual sensory deficit {{may be due to}} distorted perception of somatosensory stimuli, repre-senting another disorder of body schema associated with parietal lobe lesions. The diagnosis of non-organic illness may then be avoided by focusing on a search for parietal disease. Parietal lobe lesions may present with dramatic perceptual disturbances such as anosognosia and hemiasomatognosia. The patient may deny an obvious hemiplegia or may even deny the exist-ence of one half of his body. These disturbances are found most common in lesions of the non-dominant parietal lobe (Critchley, 1966, Fredericks, 1969; Jewesburg, 1969). However, it is a clinical axiom that parietal lobe lesions do not cause a total hemisensory loss (DeJong, 1967; Jewesburg, 1969).

40|$|The motor <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas</b> {{receiving}} {{input from}} the globus pallidus (VA) and the cerebellar nuclei (VL) appear to have different roles in the generation and guidance of movements. In order to further test these differences, we used electrical stimulation to map the ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei of the thalamus in three ketamine anaesthetised monkeys. Movements were readily evoked from VL at currents of down to 10 microA. The movements were typically multijoint, and stimulation could evoke arm and trunk or arm and facial movement at the same current threshold. Evoked arm movements often involved multiple joints, with or without finger movements. Facial movements included the lips, tongue, jaw, eyebrows and, occasionally, the eyes. The thalamic map was topographic, but complex {{with at least two}} separate regions related to arm movement. Very few sites within the VA could stimulate movement, even at high currents. We therefore suggest that the cerebellar projections to motor regions of the cortex, which pass through the VL thalamic nuclei, have a different relationship and are closer to movement execution than the projections from basal ganglia via the ventro-anterior nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The learned {{helplessness}} paradigm has been repeatedly shown to correlate with neurobiological aspects {{of depression in}} humans. In this model, rodents are exposed inescapable foot-shock in order to reveal susceptibility to escape deficit, defined as '{{learned helplessness}}' (LH). Few methods are available to probe the neurobiological aspects underlying the differences in susceptibility in the living animal, thus far being limited to studies examining regional neurochemical changes with microdialysis. With the widespread implementation of small animal neuroimaging methods, including positron emission tomography (PET), {{it is now possible}} to explore the living brain on a systems level to define regional changes that may correlate with vulnerability to stress. In this study, 12 wild type Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 40 minutes of inescapable foot-shock followed by metabolic imaging using 2 -deoxy- 2 [{sup 18 }F]fluoro-D-glucose (18 -FDG) 1 hour later. The escape test was performed on these rats 48 hours later (to accommodate radiotracer decay), where they were given the opportunity to press a lever to shut off the shock. A region of interest (ROI) analysis was used to investigate potential correlations (Pearson Regression Coefficients) between regional 18 -FDG uptake following inescapable shock and subsequent learned helpless behavior (time to finish the test; number of successful lever presses within 20 seconds of shock onset). ROI analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between time to finish and 18 -FDG uptake, and a negative correlation between lever presses and uptake, in the medial <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> (p= 0. 033, p= 0. 036). This ROI included the paraventricular thalamus, mediodorsal thalamus, and the habenula. In an effort to account for possible spillover artifact, the posterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>area</b> (including ventral medial and lateral portions) was also evaluated but did not reveal significant correlations (p= 0. 870, p= 0. 897). No other significant correlations were found in additional regions analyzed including the nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, substantia nigra, and amygdala. These data suggest that medial thalamic 18 -FDG uptake during inescapable shock may contribute to subsequent escape deficits, and are not confounded by shock effects per se, since all animals received the same treatment prior to scanning. We have previously explored 18 -FDG differences following the escape test session which also showed hyperactivity in the medial thalamus of learned helpless animals compared to non-learned helpless, and included additional cortical-limbic changes. Given the neuroanatomical connections between the medial thalamus (and habenula) with the prefrontal cortex and monoaminergic brain stem, one possible speculation is that abnormal neuronal activity in these areas during stress may set in motion circuitry changes that correlate with learned helpless behavior...|$|E

Wide differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were found in phase-locking of cortex EEG. We derive a phenomenological mathematical model based on coupled phase oscillators with continu-ous distributed frequencies to describe the neural activ-ity of the thalamocortical loop.

At the investigation of our model we use Ott-Antonsen theory [2] and Pikovsky-Rosenblum reduction methods [3]. The results derived from our mathematical model coincide with the experimental data obtained by EEG measurements. The model pro-vides that modifying the coupling strength from the tha-lamic region to a cortical region effects the duration of phase synchronization and while modifying the coupling back to the thalamic region affects the strength of syn-chronization in this cortical area. Thus it supports the view that the coupling between the thalamic region and cortical regions is the responsible mechanism for dys-function of the thalamo-cortical loop in schizophrenia...|$|E

The MGB can be subdivided into a ventral subdivision, forming part of the lemniscal (primary) auditory pathway, and medial and dorsal subdivisions, traditionally considered (alongside the Pol) part of the non-lemniscal (secondary) pathway. However, physiological studies of the auditory thalamus {{have suggested that the}} Pol may be more appropriately characterised as part of the lemniscal pathway, while the medial MGB may be part of a third (polysensory) pathway, with characteristics of lemniscal and non-lemniscal areas. We document physiological properties of neurons in histologically identified areas of the MGB and Pol in the anaesthetised mouse, and present evidence in favour of a distinctive role for medial MGB in central auditory processing. In particular, medial MGB contains a greater proportion of neurons with short first-spike latencies and high response probabilities than either the ventral or dorsal MGB, despite having low spontaneous rates. Therefore, medial MGB neurons appear to fire more reliably in response to auditory input than neurons in even the lemniscal, ventral subdivision. Additionally, responses in the Pol are more similar to those in the ventral MGB than the dorsal MGB...|$|E
40|$|Midlife obesity {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased dementia risk, yet reports on brain structure and function are mixed. We therefore assessed the effects of body mass index (BMI) on gray matter volume (GMV) and cognition in a well-characterized sample of community-dwelled older adults. GMV was measured using 3 T-neuroimaging in 617 participants (258 women, 60 - 80 years, BMI 17 - 41 kg/m 2). Also, cognitive performance and various confounders including hypertension, diabetes and APOE-genotype were assessed. A higher BMI correlated significantly with lower GMV in multiple brain regions, including (pre) frontal, temporal, insular and occipital cortex, thalamus, putamen, amygdala and cerebellum, even after adjusting for confounders. Also, lower GMV in prefrontal and <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas</b> partially mediated negative effects of (1) higher BMI and (2) higher age on memory performance. We here showed that a higher BMI in older adults is associated with widespread gray matter alterations, irrespective of obesity-related co-morbidities and other confounders. Our results further indicate that a higher BMI induces structural alterations that translate into subtle impairments in memory performance in aging...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} imaging {{membrane}} potential changes have limited spatial resolution, particularly along the axis {{perpendicular to the}} cortical surface. The laminar organization of the cortex suggests, however, that the distribution of activity in depth is not uniform. We developed a technique to resolve network activity of different cortical layers in vivo using two−photon microscopy of the voltage−sensitive dye (VSD) ANNINE− 6. We imaged spontaneous voltage changes in the barrel field of the somatosensory cortex of head−restrained mice and analyzed their spatiotemporal correlations during anesthesia and wakefulness. EEG recordings always correlated more strongly with VSD signals in layer (L) 2 than in L 1. Nearby (< 200 μm) cortical areas were correlated with one another during anesthesia. Waking the mouse strongly desynchronized neighboring cortical areas in L 1 in the 4 − to 10 −Hz frequency band. Wakefulness also slightly increased synchrony of neighboring territories in L 2 in the 0. 5 − to 4. 0 −Hz range. Our observations {{are consistent with the}} idea that, in the awake animal, long−range inputs to L 1 of the sensory cortex from various cortical and <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas</b> exert top−down control on sensory processin...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen brain {{points in}} prefrontal and <b>thalamic</b> <b>areas</b> {{of each of}} three adult male macaques were tested {{for the effects of}} {{electrical}} stimulation and coagulation during the delayed response test. During the delay period, stimulation of prefrontal areas and dorsomedial thalamus caused severe impairment in two subjects. Stimulation caused less impairment during the baiting period than during the delay period; continuous stimulation throughout the test caused less impairment than intermittent stimulation; intermittent stimulation throughout the test was the most effective mode of stimulation. Distraction tests produced the same standard of performance achieved during control tests; peripheral shocks produced a slightly impaired performance. Even aversive peripheral stimuli did not produce as many errors as did central stimuli which produced no behavioral effects. Prefrontal lesions had more disruptive and longer-lasting effects than did thalamic lesions, but the order in which the lesions were made had no effect on performance. The results substantiate previous conclusions that electrical stimulation of points {{along the banks of the}} principal sulcus can impair the delayed response performance of overtrained subjects, but, on the other hand, stimulation of dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus has the same effect...|$|R
