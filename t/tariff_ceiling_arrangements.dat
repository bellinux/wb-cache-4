40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} trade agreements where "politics" play an central role. This stands {{in contrast with the}} standard theory, where even politically-motivated governments sign trade agreements only to deal with terms-of-trade externalities. We develop a model where governments may be motivated to sign a trade agreement both by the presence of standard terms-of-trade externalities and by the desire to commit vis-a-vis domestic industrial lobbies. The model is rich in implications. In particular, it predicts that trade agreements result in deeper trade liberalization when governments are more politically motivated (provided capital mobility is sufficiently high) and when capital can move more freely across sectors. Also, governments tend to prefer a commitment in the form of <b>tariff</b> <b>ceilings</b> rather than exact tariff levels. In a fully dynamic specification of the model, trade liberalization occurs in two stages: an immediate slashing of tariffs and a subsequent gradual reduction of tariffs. The immediate tariff cut {{is a reflection of the}} terms-of-trade motive for the agreement, while the domestic-commitment motive is reflected in the gradual phase of trade liberalization.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying <b>tariff</b> <b>ceilings</b> or harmonization formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower product coverage of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the product coverage of GSP schemes in high tariff items and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP product coverage and margins in higher tariff items would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high tariff items are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high tariff items. Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs.  Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the {{multilateral}} trading system is to enhance the stability and predictability of the environment in which traders operate. Binding tariffs at the WTO reduces the scope for their discretionary use. But, countries have bound <b>tariffs</b> at <b>ceiling</b> levels often substantially above the level of applied tariffs. Therefore, whether the ceiling rate at which countries have committed at the WTO is sufficient to diminish trade policy volatility is an empirical question. Using a recently built database on applied tariffs covering over 100 countries for the period 1996 to 2009, we find evidence that countries do vary tariffs. Most importantly, we find evidence that applied tariffs of tariff lines that are bound {{are more likely to be}} decreased and less likely to be increased, and that this taming effect of the binding decreases with the level of the water (i. e. the gap between bound and applied tariff).

40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT Sustainability and „green‟ {{issues are}} {{becoming}} {{an integral part}} of business and management. There is a conscious shift that needs to be embraced by the business and management sector. Sustainable energy generation falls into this field. Large gird connected renewable energy (RE) facilities form a subset of sustainability and the clean technology sector. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) cannot compete with traditional fossil fuel generated electricity and hence support policies are required to encourage and protect these IPPs. Different policy mechanisms have been deployed with varying degrees of success in predominately developed countries. Countries like Denmark, Spain and The UK, to mention a few, have developed RE sectors, where spill over affects have taken place. From a business perspective, {{it is important to understand}} what policies are available and what factors (drivers) play a key role. This study identifies five main RE policy mechanisms (Feed-In Tariffs (FITs); Tradable Green Certificates; Renewable Portfolio Standards; Bidding/Tendering and Fiscal) of which the FIT has experienced the most success in establishing a RE sector. In addition twenty four key drivers are extracted that feed into a policy design. Using the qualitative method of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping, the study relates the policies to the drivers to identify which drivers are most effective within a RE sector. Finally the study reviewed the current developments of RE in South Africa and questions whether the current competitive bidding system with a <b>tariff</b> <b>ceiling</b> („REBID”) policy is set to create a sustainable local RE sector. This study has been based on an extensive literature review and the findings have formed the model. Model validation has used both country specific case studies and expert input, resulting in a model that can be applied universally. Modelling concluded that FITs deployed in isolation of the twenty four drivers are no better than a no-policy stance. In addition the model has identified Big Players, The Non-RE Sector, Cost Competitiveness and Risk as the most influential drivers and when managed properly, can lead to a more successful RE sector. Finally, this study could not conclude with certainty that SA‟s current policy framework is indeed sustainable, however, if Energy and Capital Costs are monitored and managed, REBID with South African Renewable Initiative (SARi) have the potential to create a solid RE sector in SA...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Following {{a period}} of {{economic}} growth, political stability and poverty reduction spanning two decades (1960 - 1979), Costa Rica experienced {{at the beginning of}} the 1980 ´s the worst recession in its most recent history. In 1981 and 1982 gross domestic product (GDP) fell by - 2. 3 % and - 7. 3 %. Analysts pinpoint to short term economic factors and long run structural problems as the main causes of the recession. Short term economic factors comprise the end of the coffee price bonanza and the second oil shock. Long run structural factors are rooted in the economic imbalances generated by the adoption of import substitution strategies. In 1985 the authorities undertook a change of regime which mixed free market with state intervention policies. Free market policies aimed at getting the prices right" by liberalizing trade through tariff and traditional export tax reduction, and by eliminating trade barriers. State intervention policies were encapsulated into non-traditional export promotion schemes and a target real exchange rate tending to favour export performance. These government policies were justified on the grounds of compensating the anti-export bias that guided the commercial policy of Costa Rica during the import substitution era. The implementation process was very gradual and began with export promotion policies followed by reduction of import and export barriers. From 1986 to 1994 trade liberalization policies were followed on a systematic basis. The <b>tariff</b> <b>ceiling</b> was substantially reduced, and tariff dispersion as well as effective protection diminished. Taxes levied on non traditional exports disappeared, while taxes on traditional exports were significantly lowered. Finally, most non tariff barriers were eliminated as quantitative import restrictions were replaced with tariffs in compliance with the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. During 1995 - 1996, the country experienced temporary interruptions in its tariff reduction and trade liberalization commitments in part due to a recession caused by internal contractionary policies and external factors (i. e., "the Tequila effect"). In 1997 as GDP growth overcame its trough, the authorities continued their outward oriented efforts. The policy centered mostly on a national tariff reduction schedule that would comply with the Central American Common External Tariff. The country plans to reach this tariff schedule in the year 2000. While trade liberalization has eliminated import surcharges and lowered, to great extent, the weight of export taxes in fiscal revenue, the same cannot be said about import duties. Export taxes represented 23. 3 % of total revenue in 1983. By 1994 - 1998, they represented 2. 1 %. The reduction of fiscal dependence on export taxes has shielded the fiscal accounts from the volatility of primary commodity price fluctuation. Import duties have, however, increased their weight in fiscal revenue. They accounted for 5. 6 % of total revenue in 1983 and for 13. 2 % for 1994 - 1998. The greater dependency of fiscal equilibrium on import duties is due both an increase in the import tax base as a consequence of liberalization and perhaps to a shift in the propensity to import. If trade reform has allowed a better allocation of resources by liberalizing import prices, it has also placed a restriction on output growth by increasing the possibilities of a balance-of-payments constraint scenario. Export promotion policies materialized into tax exemption schemes such as the CAT (tax redemption certificates). CATs were equivalent to an income tax deduction and represented 1. 9 % of total expenditure in 1985 and 4. 2 % by 1994 - 1998. The government has stopped the issue of new CATs and their fiscal impact will vanish by the year 2000. This will certainly be a source a fiscal respite and a basis on which to further reduce import duties without compromising internal equilibrium. ...|$|R

The position of the landmark with the largest belief is used to estimate the robot location. We also utilize the received signal strength (RSS) method to realize a more accurate estimation. Instead of using the Lambertian radiant intensity [21] to compute the relationship between the distance of the detected IR LED and the photodiode with the output voltage of the receiver, we used a machine-learning method to obtain a formula based on the experimental data.|$|R

This paper argues that the lack of clear WTO disciplines on regional arrangements may have already had adverse consequences for the EU. Given that the EU has declared its support for a clarification of the rules, the paper tries to identify where its priorities should lie. It is argued that there should be two such priorities. The first should be to define more precisely what is meant by an "applicable" tariff. It has never been clear whether this refers to applied tariff rates or to bound ceilings. Because of this ambiguity, Mexico was able to raise applied <b>tariffs</b> (within bound <b>ceilings)</b> on imports from the EU and other third countries in response to the peso crisis, whilst lowering tariffs on her NAFTA partners.

40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} influenza (or flu) from a patient's {{cough and}} exhaled air causes potential flu virus transmission to the persons located nearby. Hospital-acquired influenza {{is a major}} airborne disease that occurs to health care workers (HCW). This paper examines the airflow patterns and influenza-infected cough aerosol transport behavior in a ceiling-ventilated mock airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and its effectiveness in mitigating HCW's exposure to airborne infection. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the airflow patterns and the flu virus dispersal behavior in a mock AIIR is conducted using the room geometries and layout (room dimensions, bathroom dimensions and details, placement of vents and furniture), ventilation parameters (flow rates at the inlet and outlet vents, diffuser design, thermal sources, etc.), and pressurization corresponding {{to that of a}} traditional ceiling-mounted ventilation arrangement observed in existing hospitals. The measured data shows that ventilation rates for the AIIR are about 12 air changes per hour(ach). However, the numerical results reveals incomplete air mixing and that not all of the room air is changed 12 times per hour. Two life-sized breathing human models are used to simulate a source patient and a receiving HCW. A patient cough cycle is introduced into the simulation and the airborne infection dispersal is tracked in time using a multiphase flow simulation approach. The results reveal air recirculation regions that diminished the effect of air filtration and prolong the presence of flu-contaminated air at the HCW's zone. Immediately after the patient coughs (0. 51 s), the cough velocity from the patient's mouth drives the cough aerosols toward the HCW standing next to patient's bed. Within 0. 7 s, the HCW is at risk of acquiring the infectious influenza disease, as a portion of these aerosols are inhaled by the HCW. As time progresses (5 s), the aerosols eventually spread throughout the entire room, as they are carried by the AIIR airflow patterns. Subsequently, a portion of these aerosols are removed by the exhaust ventilation. However, the remaining cough aerosols reenter and recirculate in the HCW's zone until they are removed by the exhaust ventilation. The infectious aerosols become diluted in the HCW's region over a period of 10 s because of the fresh air supplied into the HCW's zone. The overall duration of influenza infection in the room (until the aerosol count is reduced to less than 0. 16 % {{of the total number of}} aerosols ejected from the patient's mouth) is recorded as approximately 20 s. With successive coughing events, a near-continuous exposure would be possible. Hence, the ceiling-ventilation arrangement of the mock AIIR creats an unfavorable environment to the HCW throughout his stay in the room, and the modeled AIIR ventilation is not effective in protecting the HCW from infectious cough aerosols. The CFD results suggest that the AIIR <b>ceiling</b> ventilation <b>arrangement</b> has a significant role in influencing the flu virus transmission to the HCW.

[...] Department of Speech and Theatre. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 1972 Missouri Vanguard Theatre {{is a small}} professional touring company with its base at the University of Missouri—Kansas City. This touring company performs primarily {{in the rural areas}} of the State of Missouri before audiences of all ages. The philosophy of performing for people of all ages has become the ambition of Missouri Vanguard, and the programs presented by Vanguard are expanding each year to encompass this philosophy. Many of the touring restrictions and limitations placed upon the technical operations of Missouri Vanguard are complex and interrelated. But one of the primary restricting factors to the operation of Vanguard is imposed by the allotted budget, which limits the number of actors and technicians hired, the number of vehicles rented, the type of scenery and lighting used, and most importantly, the scenic style of productions presented. Missouri Vanguard performs in very few buildings equipped with adequate theatre producing facilities; consequently, many existing physical conditions in the theatre plants often place limitations and restrictions upon the manner of technical operation and execution. For example, the location of the unloading area, the height of the stage <b>ceiling,</b> the <b>arrangement</b> of audience seating, and the accessibility of the electric power sources are but a few of these restricting factors. The Vanguard technicians are obligated to operate within the limitations imposed by such things as the budget, pre-tour deadlines, truck capacities, theatre plants, and the ritual of daily tour schedules, and still construct scenery and purchase equipment that is rugged, durable and of high scenic quality. In 1968, {{the first year of the}} Vanguard tour, many technical failings resulted from the technicians' lack of experience with touring. After the first tour, with the limited experience gained, the technicians progressed to the use of better and faster means of executing their technical work. The modified method of scenery construction for two-dimensional scenery has now become standardized, and an inventory of durable, stock flats has been increasing each year. Three-dimensional scenery and set properties are being constructed so that they break down into smaller units for both storage and handling. Both ornamental elements of scenery and dress properties have been a problem in the past, and they will probably continue to remain so simply because they are delicate necessities which often are unique to a particular production and present special problems of construction and handling. Vanguard has progressed from renting to owning lighting equipment. In the process or acquiring lighting equipment to tour, some selections have proven to be better than others. The most extensive improvements have been made in the lighting for the out-front positions and in the portable, legged onstage light batten. After five years of successful touring, improvements in Vanguard’s technical program are still being made. Past experiences of the seasoned technicians and new ideas of younger technicians are invaluable to the technical growth of Vanguard. Missouri Vanguard Theatre has played to well over one hundred thousand people in its five years of existence. A total of forty-two productions and classroom programs has afforded the people in the rural areas of Missouri the opportunity to experience live theatre.

40|$|Rice is {{the main}} staple food, besides wheat, in many {{countries}} in the world. For the purpose of food security, many countries protect their rice industry through various mechanisms such as domestic subsidies, import/export <b>tariffs,</b> price <b>ceilings</b> and other mechanisms. Malaysia {{is one of the}} rice importing countries, which spends millions of Malaysian Ringgit from the public funds to protect the rice industry {{and at the same time}} invests in research and development (R&D) activities to increase rice production. However, in the past 30 years, the production of rice was still not sufficient to meet the domestic demand. The purpose of the present study is to examine the impact of the reallocation of public funds from domestic subsidies to R&D expenditures. Furthermore, the present study also examines the impact of removing BERNAS, the sole importer, and removing all the trade barriers in the Malaysian rice industry. An econometrically estimated dynamic spatial equilibrium model was developed to analyse the impact of policy changes in the Malaysian rice industry. The rice trade model in this study incorporated six regions of Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia and the Rest of the World. In the present study, there are two main parts: econometrics and simulations. For each region, there were four stochastic equations; namely, consumption demand, stocks demand, area harvested and yield and the supply function was constructed as an identity comprising of area harvested, yield and the conversion rate of paddy to rice. The time series data used for the stochastic equations from the period of 1980 to 2009 were tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey Fuller test. The area harvested equation was estimated using ordinary least squares and the other stochastic equations were estimated using two-stage least squares. In the cases with autocorrelation, the equations were re-estimated using a first-order serial autocorrelation correction. The econometric results were consistent with a priori expectations and as represented in the equations the decision-making agents appeared to be well behaved according to theory. An R&D expenditure variable was incorporated into the yield function for Malaysia. To select the most appropriate yield function including the R&D expenditure variable, eight alternatives of R&D lags of different lengths and shapes were tested. Two lag lengths, 16 and 35 years and three shapes: trapezoid, inverted “V” and gamma distributions were used and the most preferred model was the gamma distribution with δ= 0. 6 and λ= 0. 8 with a lag of 16 years. The R&D elasticities in the range of 0. 10 to 0. 13 were computed for the Malaysian rice industry and these were found to be consistent with the R&D literature. As there seemed to be no other estimates of R&D elasticities for Malaysian agriculture previously published, these estimates are seen as a contribution to knowledge about the effects of R&D expenditure in Malaysia. The coefficients of all the exogenous variables from the econometric estimation were collapsed into the intercept and then these collapsed demand and supply equations were included in the spatial equilibrium model. The spatial equilibrium model was formulated using a primal-dual approach in a mathematical programming model. The model was simulated dynamically from 1982 to 2009 using the Lemke algorithm written in Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel. Both statistical and graphical methods were then used to validate the historical data with the simulation values. The simulated endogenous variables were found to replicate the historical values quite closely. Four historically based policy simulations were developed to analyse policy changes in Malaysia. In the first two scenarios, 10 per cent and 25 per cent of the rice subsidy funds were reallocated to R&D expenditures. In the third scenario, the sole importer status of BERNAS was removed and replaced with import tariffs and in the fourth scenario the free trade environment was represented. The results from the simulations in scenario 2 showed that if the government had allocated 25 per cent of the subsidy funds into R&D expenditures in the 1980 s, self-sufficiency in rice could have been achieved 25 years earlier. Furthermore, both the consumers and producers would be better off if these changes had taken place back in 1980 s. Findings that emerged from this study have some important policy implications for the Malaysian rice industry. The findings suggest that the government interventions, such as providing domestic subsidies to farmers to increase the production of rice and the use of a marketing board to control imports do not necessarily protect the industry. The findings indicate that if the government had chosen to eliminate domestic subsidies and the sole importer status, consumers would be better off even though the farmers‟ revenue would be affected in such a free trade environment. The findings in the present study also suggest that the income per farmer could increase by about double if the government invested 25 per cent of the subsidy funds into R&D expenditure. The key recommendation from this study is that the government should remove the domestic subsidies and other trade barriers and use the limited public funds for R&D related activities and both the consumers and producers will be better off than in the current situation...|$|R
