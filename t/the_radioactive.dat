5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack <b>the</b> <b>radioactive</b> elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>radioactive</b> element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago <b>the</b> <b>radioactive</b> element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
