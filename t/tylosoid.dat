40|$|Old {{architectural}} wood materials {{damaged by}} a fire were evaluated {{on the basis}} of wood species and scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM) observation of wood tissues in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis. Results of SEM observation showed that tracheid wall thickness of burned parts was very thin com-pared with undamaged and sound wood, and <b>tylosoid</b> in the resin canals disappeared after the exposure to fire. SEM-EDXS analysis indicated that carbon and oxygen peaks occurred in the original energy band, and the carbon peak was higher than that of the oxygen in the burned part. A computerized tomography was also undertaken to in-vestigate the carbonization layer formed by fire and possible internal defects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of cyanogenesis on the onset of irreversible tapping panel dryness (TPD) and the physiological and histological aspects of secondary phloem in the trunk (tapping panel) of rubber trees (Hevea spp.). Two cyanogenic compounds, linamarin and KCN, were applied separately on the trunk bark of healthy mature trees belonging to two Brazilian clones (Fx 4098 and Fx 3899). Changes in histology, latex pressure potential (YP) and cyanogenic potential (HCNP) were followed in the trunk inner barks. In addition, the HCNp levels were determined in TPD-affected plants of both clones. The applications of linamarin or KCN in healthy plants decreased latex YP, and formed <b>tylosoids</b> associated with in situ coagulation of latex. The clone Fx 4098 had the higher HCNp and showed the quicker and stronger responses to the cyanogenic compounds. Plants with TPD syntoms had a higher HCNp than the untreated healthy ones. Since histological changes are also structural markers of early TPD, it can be inferred that excessive release of cyanide can induce it in sensitive rubber clones. 201...|$|R

Dois compostos cianogênicos, linamarina e KCN, foram aplicados separadamente na casca do tronco de árvores sadias de dois clones adultos (Fx 4098 e Fx 3899). Alterações na histologia, potencial de pressão de látex (&# 936;P) e potencial cianogênico (HCNp) foram monitoradas. Além disso, os níveis HCNp foram determinados em plantas afetadas por TPD, em ambos os clones. A aplicação de linamarina ou KCN em plantas saudáveis causou redução em &# 936;P e formação de tilosoides associados à coagulação do látex in situ. O clone Fx 4098 apresentou o maior nível de HCNp, e respostas mais intensas e rápidas aos compostos cianogênicos. Plantas com sintomas de TPD têm maior HCNp de que as sadias. Como as alterações histológicas observadas são reconhecidos marcadores estruturais precoces de TPD, pode-se inferir que a liberação excessiva de cianeto pode induzi-las em clones de seringueira sucetívei...|$|R
