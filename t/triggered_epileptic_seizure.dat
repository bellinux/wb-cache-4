40|$|AbstractReflex {{seizures}} {{can occur}} {{in response to a}} variety of stimuli, both sensory and emotional. Common triggers include light and music; however, in a growing number of case reports, the phenomenon of sexual activity <b>triggering</b> <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> is described. The majority of these case reports have been in women so far, and most have been found to localise to the right cerebral hemisphere on interictal electroencephalography (EEG). We report the case of a 34 -year-old male with orgasm-induced seizures, recorded on ictal EEG. This gentleman's electrophysiology localised his seizure focus to the left cerebral hemisphere, making his case atypical in comparison with the majority of previous reports. Orgasm-induced seizures are an increasingly well-described phenomenon and we suggest that this should be taken into account when assessing patients with possible reflex seizures...|$|R

40|$|People of all ages, but {{especially}} children and adolescents, are increasingly exposed to visual stimuli. Typical environmental stimuli that can <b>trigger</b> <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in susceptible persons are televisions (TVs), computers, videogames (VGs), discothèque lights, venetian blinds, striped walls, rolling stairs (escalators), striped clothing, and sunlight reflected from snow or the sea or interrupted by trees during {{a ride in}} a car or train. Less common stimuli are rotating helicopter blades, disfunctioning fluorescent lighting, welding lights, etc. New potentially provocative devices turn up now and then unexpectedly.

50|$|Those with {{photosensitive}} epilepsy can have seizures triggered by flashing lights. Other precipitants can <b>trigger</b> an <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizure</b> {{in patients who}} otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures. For example, children with childhood absence epilepsy may be susceptible to hyperventilation. In fact, flashing lights and hyperventilation are activating procedures used in clinical EEG to help trigger seizures to aid diagnosis. Finally, other precipitants can facilitate, rather than obligately trigger, seizures in susceptible individuals. Emotional stress, sleep deprivation, sleep itself, heat stress, alcohol and febrile illness are examples of precipitants cited by patients with epilepsy. Notably, the influence of various precipitants varies with the epilepsy syndrome. Likewise, the menstrual cycle in women with epilepsy can influence patterns of seizure recurrence. Catamenial epilepsy is the term denoting seizures linked to the menstrual cycle.|$|R
40|$|Stress {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} self-identified seizure triggers in patients with epilepsy; however, most previous publications on stress and epilepsy have focused on the role of stress in the initial development of epilepsy. This narrative review explores the causal role of stress in triggering seizures in patients with existing epilepsy. Findings from human studies of psychological stress, as well as of physiologic stress responses in humans and animals, and evidence from nonpharmacologic interventions for epilepsy are considered. The evidence from human studies for stress as a <b>trigger</b> of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> is inconclusive. Although retrospective self-report studies show that stress is the most common patient-perceived seizure precipitant, prospective studies have yielded mixed results and studies of life events suggest that stressful experiences only trigger seizures in certain individuals. There is limited evidence suggesting that autonomic arousal can precede seizures. Interventions designed to improve coping with stress reduce seizures in some individuals. Studies of physiologic stress using animal epilepsy models provide more convincing evidence. Exposure to exogenous and endogenous stress mediators has been found to increase epileptic activity in the brain and trigger overt seizures, especially after repeated exposure. In conclusion, stress is likely to exacerbate the susceptibility to <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in a subgroup of individuals with epilepsy and may play a role in triggering "spontaneous" seizures. However, there is currently no strong evidence for a close link between stress and seizures in the majority of people with epilepsy, although animal research suggests that such links are likely. Further research is needed into the relationship between stress and seizures and into interventions designed to reduce perceived stress and improve quality of life with epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency and}} risk factors of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in a large cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Five hundred nineteen consecutive patients with SLE were studied, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 7. 8 years. The type and frequency of risk factors associated with acute and recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> in SLE were determined. Results: Sixty (11. 6 %) patients with <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> were identified. <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred {{at the onset of}} SLE symptoms in 19 (31. 6 %) and after the onset of SLE in 41 of 60 (68. 3 %) patients. Fifty-three of 60 (88. 3 %) patients had acute symptomatic <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> and 7 of 60 (11. 7 %) had recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures.</b> Variables associated with acute <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE onset were stroke (p= 0. 0004) and antiphospholipid antibodies (p= 0. 0013). <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> during follow-up were related to nephritis (p= 0. 001), antiphospholipid antibodies (p= 0. 005), and <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at disease onset (p= 0. 00001). All seven patients who presented recurrent <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> had antiphospholipid syndrome and interictal epileptic abnormalities on EEG. Conclusions: <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> were observed in 11. 2 % of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies and stroke were related to <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE disease onset. Patients with renal flares, <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> at SLE disease onset, and antiphospholipid antibodies were at greater risk for acute symptomatic seizures during follow-up.

The experience of such consultation for a period of 2 years is discussed by presenting 19 such cases. The importance of a thorough history obtained from the patient and family about the environmental background is emphasized in order to increase the practitioner's awareness of a functional pathology. Epilepsy, as a disease, cannot be defined as one entity or syndrome. It has so many aspects of symptomatology that the diagnostician may be faced with a diagnostic dilemma. The questions of what type of epilepsy the pa-tient has, if it is local or general, organic or idiopathic are dealt with in the process of diagnosing each new case or seizure disorder. There is one aspect that might not be considered at least in the first stages of the diagnostic process. This is the emotional aspect of epilepsy. In dealing with this, we should differentiate between two factors.

We also investigated impact of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> and epileptiform activity on clinical outcome (30  months post-onset). <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred in 35 / 130 patients (26. 9  %), epileptiform activity in 61 / 130 (46. 9  %) patients, without significant differences related to clinical diagnosis or aetiology. Among patients with epileptiform activity, only 26 / 61 (42. 6  %) developed clinically evident seizures. Mortality at 30  months {{was not significantly}} influenced {{by the presence of}} seizures or epileptiform activity. The proportion of patients who recovered at long-term follow-up was higher in patients without than in patients with <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> but was similar in patients with or without epileptiform activity.

In conclusion, seizures were detected in about one third of the whole sample, and in about a half of patients with epileptiform activity, regardless of clinical diagnosis or aetiology. Although <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> or epileptiform activity did not significantly affect mortality rate, we demonstrated that <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> could hamper recovery of consciousness. <b>Epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> thus qualify as one of the factors largely undetermined at the moment which can influence prognosis in DOC patients...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Purpose: Some {{patients}} with nonconvulsive status epilepticus {{are known to}} exhibit catatonic stupor. Thus {{it is necessary to}} rule out ictal catatonia by electroencephalography in {{patients with}} catatonic stupor. However, few reports are available on <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on catatonic stupor. Methods: We report three cases of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on psychiatric catatonic stupor without a prominent predisposing factor, including high fever or encephalitis. None of the patients had a personal or family history of neurologic disease, including epilepsy. Results: In all three patients, catatonic stupor persisted after resolution of the <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> with administration of phenytoin. In two of the three patients, catatonic stupor resolved with electroconvulsive therapy, which caused no marked adverse effects. Conclusions: Because it is possible that catatonic stupor itself predisposes patients to the development of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures,</b> electroencephalographic examinations in patients with catatonic stupor are indispensable for early recognition not only of nonconvulsive status epilepticus but also of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures</b> superimposed on catatonic stupor. Electroconvulsive therapy deserves consideration when catatonic stupor persists after resolution of <b>epileptic</b> <b>seizures...</b>|$|R
