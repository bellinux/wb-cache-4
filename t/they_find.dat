Inside, <b>they</b> <b>find</b> makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl until <b>they</b> <b>find</b> a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E

5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. <b>They</b> <b>find</b> that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E
5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but <b>they</b> <b>find</b> the beetles to be larger and more mature.

Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed the beetles in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery.

They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer; they will usually bury specimens <b>they</b> <b>find.</b> In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E
