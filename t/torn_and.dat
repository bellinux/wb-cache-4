5|$|She married Paul Mansfield at age 17 on May 10, 1950. Their daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield, {{was born}} {{six months later}} on November 8, 1950. After getting married, Jayne and her husband {{enrolled}} in Southern Methodist University to study acting. In 1951, she moved to Austin, Texas, with her husband, and studied dramatics at the University of Texas at Austin, until her junior year. There {{she worked as a}} nude model for art classes, sold books door to door, and worked as a receptionist of a dance studio. She also joined the Curtain Club, a popular campus theatrical society that featured Tom Jones, Harvey Schmidt, Rip <b>Torn,</b> <b>and</b> Pat Hingle among its members of that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{rebuilding}} of the venue took place {{ahead of the}} 1962 season, when the wooden stands were <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> replaced with concrete stands on both long sides. On the south side, a wave-shaped roof was built; originally designed to be self-supporting, the contractor, Reinertsen, did not trust their own calculations and made a last-minute decision to install support columns. The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches {{to be held at}} the venue. An all-weather running track was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a short walk to the stadium. In 1994, the first pitch with Desso GrassMaster was laid.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E

25|$|While at Yale, Horn {{also began}} her drawing practice, which she {{describes}} as “absolutely essential to me, although not to my viewer. My drawing was always about my relationship to it, not the audience’s.” Produced from the 1980s onwards, her drawings are collage-like blots of pigment applied to sometimes <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> (once again) diagrammatically pieced-together sheets of paper. Small markings – words and numbers – track the work’s progression built up with the recomposing of the image. In the 1990s, Horn's drawings grew in scale.|$|E
25|$|On 16 February, a 300 strong Muslim mob {{attacked}} {{the village of}} Akhra. The destroyed the images and went after the priest who fled.

Their sacred threads were <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> stamped upon and they were forcibly converted to Islam. In the villages of Sunaita and Kurma, the Hindu women were attacked. Their sindur and conch shell bangles were broken. In the village of Rajaganj Akhra, the houses of Nir Bhatta and Ram Chandra Bhatta were looted. On 17 February, a 500 to 600 strong armed mob attacked the village of Lakeshwar under Chhatak police station. The Brahmin houses were looted. Two of them were severely beaten up.

During the night the villagers swam across the river to safety. At Pargram, the houses of Akrur Namashudra and Ramesh Namashudra were looted and forcibly occupied by the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Gawain {{features}} {{frequently in}} modern literature and media. Modern English depictions of him are {{heavily influenced by}} Malory, though characterizations are inconsistent. Alfred Tennyson adapts episodes from Malory to present Gawain as a worldly and faithless knight in his Idylls of the King. Similarly, T. H. White's novel The Once and Future King follows Malory, but presents Gawain as more churlish than Malory's <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> tragic portrayal. In contrast, Thomas Berger's Arthur Rex portrays Gawaine as open-minded and introspective about his flaws, qualities that make him the Round Table's greatest knight. Though he usually plays a supporting role, some works feature Gawain as the main character. Vera Chapman's The Green Knight and Anne Crompton's Gawain and Lady Green offer modern retellings of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Gwalchmai is the protagonist in Gillian Bradshaw's Celtic-tinged Hawk of May and its sequels. An aged Gawain {{is one of the}} central characters in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Buried Giant.|$|E

25|$|Ebadi and {{the other}} lawyers of the family insisted in the court that they know that Kazemi was not killed by Aghdam-Ahmadi, and they need {{witnesses}} {{to be brought to}} the court in order to find the real murderer, who they guessed may be Mohammad Bakhshi, a high officer of the Evin prison. The list of witnesses they requested included Saeed Mortazavi, the general prosecutor of Tehran Mohsen Armin, reformist member of the previous parliament , Jamileh Kadivar, and Mohsen Mirdamadi, Minister of Intelligence Ali Younesi, the Vice President of Legal Affairs Mohammad Ali Abtahi, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ahmad Masjedjamei, the five judges who were present during Kazemi's interrogation, a few employees of the Evin prison, the president of the Baghiyyatollah hospital, and all of the medical staff who had signed her file. Judge Farahani denied all of the requests. The lawyers also quoted the official report of death that various of parts of Kazemi's body had been damaged and her clothes were <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> bloody, which proves that she had been tortured.|$|E
25|$|The {{cost of an}} ACL {{reconstruction}} surgery {{will vary}} due to a few different reasons such as where you live, which graft is used, if the meniscus is also <b>torn,</b> <b>and</b> the coverage of your insurance. A study has shown in 2016 that metropolitan areas, {{of at least one}} million residents, located on the western coast of the United States of America and areas like Minnesota, Indiana, and Michigan were more expensive that the East and South East coast of the United States. Another study, conducted by Baylor University, found that ACL reconstruction procedures using the bone-patella tendon-bone technique took 2.5 hours longer than using a hamstring graft. The operation room costs and hospital charges for that amount of extra time came to about $1,580 more expensive. This also applies to having a torn meniscus during the procedure. Fixing the torn cartilage will increase the procedure time, increasing cost. Insurance plays the biggest roll in cost for an ACL reconstruction since that it will be covering majority of the costs. The coverage of your plan, deductibles, and insurance company will determine how much the patient will pay in copay's.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 1937, {{a family}} boating on the River Idle in Bawtry spotted {{an object in}} the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family {{discovered}} that the object was the partially decomposed body of a child, with the head and upper torso embedded in silt and trapped in a drain below water level. Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal. On {{the banks of the}} river was a <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> rotting sack which had evidently been used to transport the child's body. The location was approximately 30 miles from where Nodder had lived. The body was moved to an inn at Newington, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled—most likely with a ligature—and that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive adipocere formation upon the corpse prevented the pathologist from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder.|$|E

25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become <b>torn</b> <b>and</b> was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E
