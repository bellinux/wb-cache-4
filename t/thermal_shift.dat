40|$|High-resolution photoemission spectra {{from the}} shallow core levels of alkali metals and of In have been {{obtained}} between 78 K and room temperature. The data yield values for the alkali-metal surface-atom core-level <b>shift</b> and show <b>thermal</b> <b>shifts</b> of comparable size for bulk and surface. The positive surface shifts are due to the spill-out of conduction-electron charge, {{which is responsible for}} the surface dipole layer. The surface shifts are in good agreement with values obtained from a Born-Haber cycle expressed in terms of surface energies. The <b>thermal</b> <b>shifts</b> are proportional to the lattice expansion, and arise from both initial-state and final-state effects. As the lattice expands, the Fermi level decreases, decreasing the core-electron binding energy. At the same time, the expansion of the conduction-electron charge increases rs, thereby decreasing the potential at the core level and increasing the binding energy. The expansion also decreases the relaxation energy, further increasing the core-electron binding energy. In the alkali metals, the combined potential- and relaxation-energy terms dominate the Fermi-level term, making the shifts positive.

An intrinsic limitation of this assay is that not all proteins aggregate upon unfolding but might instead populate highly soluble, relatively compact molten-globule (like) conformations.

50|$|Recent {{developments}} have extended <b>thermal</b> <b>shift</b> {{approaches to the}} analysis of ligand interactions in complex mixtures, including intact cells. Initial observations of individual proteins using fast parallel proteolysis (FastPP) showed that stabilization by ligand binding could impart resistance to proteolytic digestion with thermolysin. Protection relative to reference was quantified through either protein staining on gels or Western blotting with a labeling antibody directed to a tag fused to the target protein. CETSA, for cellular <b>thermal</b> <b>shift</b> assay, is a method that monitors the stabilization effect of drug binding through the prevention of irreversible protein precipitation, which is usually initiated when a protein becomes thermally denatured. In CETSA, aliquots of cell lysate are transiently heated to different temperatures, following which samples are centrifuged to separate soluble fractions from precipitated proteins. The presence of the target protein in each soluble fraction is determined by Western blotting and used to construct a CESTA melt curve that can inform regarding in vivo targeting, drug distribution, and bioavailability. Both FastPP and CETSA generally require antibodies to facilitate target detection, and consequently are generally used in contexts where the target identity is known a priori. Newer developments seek to merge aspects of FastPP and CETSA approaches, by assessing the ligand-dependent dependent proteolytic protection of targets in cells using mass spectroscopy (MS) to detect shifts in proteolysis patterns associated with protein stabilization. Present implementations still require a priori knowledge of expected targets to facilitate data analysis, but improvements in MS data collection strategies, together with the use of improved computational tools and database structures can potentially allow the approach to be used for de novo target decryption on the total cell proteome scale. This would be a major advance for drug discovery since it would allow the identification of discrete molecular targets (as well as off-target interactions) for drugs identified through high-content cellular or phenotypic drug screens.|$|E
50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>shift</b> assay quantifies {{the change}} in thermal {{denaturation}} temperature of a protein under varying conditions. The differing conditions that can be examined are very diverse, e.g. pH, salts, additives, drugs, drug leads, oxidation/reduction, or mutations. The binding of low molecular weight ligands can increase the thermal stability of a protein, as described by Daniel Koshland (1958) and Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang and Schellman (1959). Almost half of enzymes require a metal ion co-factor. Thermostable proteins are often more useful than their non-thermostable counterparts, e.g. DNA polymerase in the polymerase chain reaction, so protein engineering often includes addingmutations to increase thermal stability. Protein crystallisation is more successful for proteins with a higher melting point and adding buffer components that stabilise proteins improve the likelihood of protein crystals forming.If examining pH then the possible effects of the buffer molecule on thermal stability {{should be taken into}} account along with the fact that pKa of each buffer molecule changes uniquely with temperature. Additionally, any time a charged species is examined the effects of the counterion should be accounted for.|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} aspect of elevated temperature {{and its relationship}} to the science of strain gage calibrations of aircraft structures are addressed. A section of a wing designed for a high-speed aircraft structure was used to study this problem. This structure was instrumented with strain gages calibrated at both elevated and room temperatures. Load equations derived from a high-temperature load calibration were compared with equations derived from an identical load calibration at room temperature. The implications of the high temperature load calibration were studied from the viewpoint of applicability and necessity. Load equations derived from the room temperature load calibration resulted in generally lower equation standard errors than equations derived from the elevated temperature load calibration. A distributed load was applied to the structure at elevated temperature and strain gage outputs were measured. This applied load was then calculated using equations derived from both the room temperature and elevated temperature calibration data. It was found that {{no significant differences between the}} two equation systems existed in terms of computing this applied distributed load, as long as the <b>thermal</b> <b>shifts</b> resulting from <b>thermal</b> stresses could be identified.
