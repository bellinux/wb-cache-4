40|$|This study investigates whether {{interest}} rates and household lending caused housing price bubbles in Korea over the period of 1986 to 2003. Using a regime-switching model, we found evidence {{of the existence of}} housing price bubbles throughout the sample period, with the exception of 1998 when Korea suffered from a financial crisis. Using a Kalman filter technique, we estimated the size of housing price bubbles for the sample period. Finally, using generalized impulse response function analysis and variance decompositions, we found that housing price bubbles increased with household lending and industrial production, whereas they decreased with interest rate; this latter effect is relatively small, however. Policy implications include the importance of preemptive intervention on household lending in order to contain housing price bubbles, but {{interest rates}} appear to be a less effective policy <b>tool.</b> <b>Housing</b> price bubbles Regime switching model Kalman filter...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Home Appreciation Participation Notes (HAPNs), {{an innovative}} new housing finance <b>tool.</b> <b>Housing</b> is a commodity providing two distinct utilities: shelter and investment. Traditionally, buyers {{have had to}} purchase both elements in tandom. HAPNs allow buyers to purchase these elements individually. Thus, buyers can focus on purchasing housing units that best fit their shelter needs, investing in housing appreciation to whatever extent is appropriate {{for the needs of}} their investment portfolio. HAPNs are different from previous financing tools in three key ways: there is no payment burden until ownership of the home is transferred, the risk of housing price declines is shifted to investors, and the final payoff is indexed to the appreciation rates of local housing prices. With these three features, HAPNs considerably improve the affordability of homeownership while reducing the risk of default and avoiding the moral hazard associated with shared appreciation instruments. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{program for the}} simulation of elastic wave propagation and scattering in three-dimensional (3 -D) cylindrical coordinates based on the first-order velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on staggered grids. Both Liao's and Lindman's absorbing boundary conditions are implemented for the exterior boundaries to efficiently truncate the computation domain for elongated 3 -D well logging problems. Symmetric and anti-symmetric boundaries in azimuthal and axial directions are also implemented in the code to further {{reduce the size of}} the problem. Included {{for the first time with}} this code are very large and complex geometrical structures such as the whole slotted sleeve housing of a sonic well-logging tool which typically involves hundreds of millions of unknowns. The calculation for such a large problem only takes a couple of days on a four- processor SGI Power Challenge machine. Different types of slotted sleeve models are studied for sonic logging tools. Simulation results show that different slotted sleeves vary widely in delaying and attenuating the pipe waves which travel along the <b>tool</b> <b>housing.</b> A new slotted sleeve structure with three horizontal slot sections for every vertical slot period is proposed for better performance. A dipole source is found to produce much cleaner waveforms than a monopole source. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Toronto’s {{housing system}} is in crisis. As we persist in {{maintaining}} this failing system, we are limiting ourselves {{to the possibility of}} creating transformational change. Toronto’s housing arena is a complex organism of competing interests and influences, reinforcing a stratification between those who benefit from it and those who do not. With limited housing choices, many Torontonians are left with few opportunities to invest in their communities and to generate personal financial wealth for their futures. Through foresight methods, systems analysis, and generative design research techniques, this project asserts that we can create change in Toronto’s housing system by transforming real estate investment into an inclusive community-building <b>tool.</b> <b>Housing</b> Horizons begins by describing the evolution of the housing arena in Canada and analyzing the dynamics at play in the current system. The research then proposes several design principles for innovation: shift the power in the development industry to smaller community-based players, create wealth-generating mechanisms suitable for renters, and foster collaboration across stakeholders in the system. A city where all citizens can thrive is only possible when the housing system contributes to the wellbeing of its entire population – this vision can be realized through strategies that level the playing field for all...|$|E

60|$|Presently {{we came to}} a long clearing, {{where it}} had once been the {{intention}} of some capitalists to build a railroad. But the matter had drifted into litigation, and nothing was done but to build a <b>tool</b> <b>house</b> and cut away the trees and brush.|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless, we lost no time {{in getting}} away from the <b>tool</b> <b>house.</b> We walked side by side, I with the pistol in the pocket of my jacket, and Dick with the lantern held aloft, that we might see to make rapid {{progress}} over the unaccustomed road.|$|R

60|$|I was not greatly {{surprised}} to see him, for, as mentioned before, the old <b>tool</b> <b>house</b> was frequently used by men of his stamp. He had as much right there as I had, and though I was chagrined to see him enter I was {{in no position to}} protest.|$|R
60|$|The <b>tool</b> <b>house</b> {{had burned}} to the ground, there being no means at hand to {{extinguish}} the fire. The glare of the conflagration had called out several dozens of people from Darbyville and the vicinity, several of whom had stumbled upon me as I lay in the clearing.|$|R
