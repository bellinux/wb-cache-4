5|$|Some stamps {{were issued}} {{in the form}} of a {{miniature}} sheet comprising from one to sixteen stamps of a single, or multiple, design from one issue printed on the same sheet and sold in that format. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> sheets are most often produced in addition to the same designs issued as single stamps.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> appear {{realistic}} in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> city project {{involved}} {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Miniatures</b> were {{negatively}} {{received by}} critics. Vincent McDermott, from The Musical Quarterly, described the {{whole set of}} miniatures as [...] "dull". However, <b>the</b> <b>miniatures</b> {{were some of the}} few early compositions accepted for publication.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> towers bear finer {{and more}} elegant details, {{indicating}} that architectural ideas traveled fast {{from the north}} to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and a change in <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (kapota), a floor (vyalamala), a balustrade (vedika) and a roof (kuta) with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed dravida miniature towers with many tiny tiers (tala) came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain {{an image of a}} deity.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Carroll was {{selected}} to represent Heath High School at Kentucky Boys State, a week-long a civic affairs summer camp for high school seniors-to-be. Participants in the camp create a miniature state government based on their state's actual government. At the camp, Carroll was elected governor of <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> government. The following year, he graduated as salutatorian and student body president of Heath High School.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the resort}} {{benefited from a}} £14million (2011:£) {{investment}} and improvement scheme, following which the resort was known as Funcoast World. Around this time, many of the structures were subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre. The 1980s saw the removal of <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> railway and chairlift system, but also saw {{the construction of a}} new indoor swimming pool named the Funsplash and an outdoor fun pool.|$|E

5000|$|The French Orientalist Edgard Blochet (1870-1937) {{argued that}} some of the folios of the manuscript, {{including}} the pictorial series, were an interpolation no earlier than the 10th or 11th century. Since the original caption accompanying <b>the</b> <b>miniatures</b> is of <b>the</b> same paleographic character as the main text of the manuscript, this theory was rejected by Giuseppe Furlani and by Carlo Cecchelli in the commentary of the facsimile edition of <b>the</b> <b>miniatures</b> published in 1959. [...] But doubts as to the original unity of the contents continued. [...] More recently, scholars have proposed that the text of 586 was only bound up together with <b>the</b> <b>miniatures</b> in <b>the</b> 15th century, and that <b>the</b> <b>miniatures</b> themselves were taken from at least one other original manuscript, and come from two different campaigns of work.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, who were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health had deteriorated as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> heart attacks which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|The Ickenham and District Society of Model Engineers {{was formed}} in September 1948 and {{originally}} met in the old ARP huts, before moving to Ickenham Hall. On 14 May 1949, the society held their first exhibition of miniature locomotives in a field off Swakeleys Road. A new society clubhouse opened on 18 June 1955 on a site near the Coach & Horses public house where it remains. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> railway {{is open to the}} public on the first Saturday of each month.|$|E
5|$|The extant folios of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise {{the doctrine of the}} four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when {{the two sides of}} its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small {{droplets}} of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E
5|$|This {{time they}} come {{too close to}} being caught having public sex, and while they manage to escape, they have to flee through Springfield in the nude.

5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding <b>the</b> <b>miniature</b> Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. <b>The</b> <b>miniature</b> working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art {{is focused on the}} word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or geometrical designs, not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of <b>the</b> <b>miniature,</b> and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E
