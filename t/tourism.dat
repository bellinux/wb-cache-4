5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut <b>Tourism</b> {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for <b>Tourism</b> Development in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut <b>tourism</b> operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut <b>tourism</b> industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives <b>tourism</b> numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based <b>tourism</b> market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many <b>tourism</b> organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between <b>tourism</b> operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E
5|$|Malta's <b>tourism</b> {{industry}} faces {{a number}} of issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's <b>tourism</b> industry is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when <b>tourism</b> numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese <b>tourism</b> operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese <b>tourism</b> operators must balance increased <b>tourism</b> numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's <b>tourism</b> development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing <b>tourism</b> in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from <b>tourism</b> and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial <b>tourism</b> steering committee aims to ensure that <b>tourism</b> is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and <b>tourism</b> skills to indigenous people.|$|E

5|$|The {{volatility}} of the Maltese <b>tourism</b> {{market in the}} past has been largely due to trends in the preferences of tourists from the United Kingdom, who comprise Malta's largest <b>tourism</b> market. Although Malta's uniform use of English, its traditional ties to the United Kingdom and low-cost travel options have made it an attractive option to British tourists, changing preferences of these tourists can impact Malta's <b>tourism</b> income quite significantly. For example, the increasing preference of British tourists for Spanish destinations during the 1980s was reflected in a drop in Malta's <b>tourism</b> numbers during that period.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, Kerala was a {{relatively}} unknown destination compared to other states in the country. In 1986 the government of Kerala declared <b>tourism</b> an important industry {{and it was the}} first state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala <b>Tourism</b> Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees the <b>tourism</b> prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the <b>tourism</b> industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala <b>tourism</b> is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall. In 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5million tourists, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark.|$|E
