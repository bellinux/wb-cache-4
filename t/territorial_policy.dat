50|$|Another {{proposition}} is {{the establishment}} of a condominium of the Flemish and the French-speaking Communities of Brussels, where both sides would govern Brussels together for national and international issues.

This idea is in general popular among Flemish politicians, such as socialist politician Louis Tobback and nationalist Bart De Wever.|$|R

40|$|Current {{changes in}} {{territorial}} organization are interpreted {{by focusing on}} two main aspects that are different yet closely interrelated. The first aspect concerns relationships between unfolding processes of territorial redefinition and changes imposed by globalization processes and by European integration, and {{by the loss of}} centrality and of part of the power of nation-state government. The second aspect concerns the change in forms and procedures of collective action in urban and <b>territorial</b> <b>policies,</b> recognizing, in particular, the consolidation - including in practices - of forms of partnership, interinstitutional cooperation, strategic planning and governance. Within this general context, this article aims to present and discuss changes, both ongoing and recent, by (1) presenting the changes that are emerging in the framework of Italian urban and territorial policies; and (2) discussing critically, with reference to the Italian case, the relationship between change in the idea of local territories and change in urban and <b>territorial</b> <b>policies.</b> Our aim is to verify whether, within what limits and from what point of view, the innovations introduced in the Italian context may be interpreted as changes that are moving towards more place-focused forms of urban and territorial governance...|$|R

The OECD’s market predominant approach for endogenous or place-based development policies of the European Union’s Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) has influenced countries like Brazil. At the same time when the European Parliament renews its support to regions in transition and to the cross-border ones, the reality of European borders shows a relatively pessimistic scenario, despite important experiences of territorial management like in the Upper Rhine region between France, Germany and Switzerland.

40|$|The {{message of}} this {{contribution}} {{is that now}} that the EU <b>territorial</b> cohesion <b>policy</b> has been formally recognized in the European Constitutional Treaty, the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) should evolve towards a discussion of common principles of EU territorial governance.

Moreover, the experiences of European spatial planning, summed up here in four main regional perspectives, show that some common principles of EU territorial governance would be rather in the interest of not only Community institutions, but of all public authorities in Europe, who, whether they appreciate it or not, already participate in <b>territorial</b> cohesion <b>policy</b> and are progressively transformed by it...|$|R
