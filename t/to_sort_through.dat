A card that would be canceled by one that is already in play is canceled the moment it comes into play, and should also be taken into account.|$|R

There was little previous research done on African-American quiltmaking so in addition <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> her own research and exhausting library resources, Benberry began to interview African-American quilt-makers and gathered information about slave-made quilts, {{as well as their}} personal take on the role of African-American quilt-makers in the realm of American quilt history. Benberry ventured away from previous theories on African-American quilt making that suggested visual criteria was the main determinant in qualifying a quilt as African-American. She countered the theories on African-American quilts being determined by one visual style (improvisational) by noting in her comprehensive research the differences in technique throughout several African-American quilts.|$|R

A particular concern is the growing tendency among some feminist political scientists to use "discourse" as shorthand for ways of talking about an issue. Critical <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> different meanings of discourse, it argues, is the question of subject "agency" - the extent to which subjects can use discourses or are constituted by them.

Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'"

2500|$|Sexual {{activity}} of kangaroos consists of consort pairs. Oestrous females roam widely and {{attract the attention}} of males with conspicuous signals. A male will monitor a female and follow her every movement. He sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus, a process exhibiting the flehmen response. The male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her. [...] If the female does not run away, the male will continue by licking, pawing, and scratching her, and copulation will follow. After copulation is over, the male will move on to another female. Consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long. Thus, a consort pair is likely to {{attract the attention of}} a rival male. As larger males are tending bonds with females near oestrus, smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus. Dominant males can avoid having <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> females to determine their reproductive status by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight.|$|E
