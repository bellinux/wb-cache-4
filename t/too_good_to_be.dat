25|$|For {{the first}} time in 'Australian Idol' history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges {{initially}} chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed out yet again. The judges decided however that Roxane was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left out of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the finals.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a similar}} premise to the {{previous}} game, Danganronpa 2 puts players in control of Hajime Hinata, an amnesiac boy who has just become one of Hope's Peak Academy's 'Ultimate' students, alongside fifteen others. The students find themselves taken to the remote tropical Jabberwock Island by their alleged teacher, a small, rabbit-like mascot named Usami, who claims {{it to be a}} simple field trip. However, things turn out to be <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get away with it. If the students can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but if they make the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E

Gehringer said of Houtteman's high trading price, [...] "Art has always had good stuff—much <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a 20-game loser". That season, he was used as both a starter and reliever during the season. However, he lost six straight decisions, and {{by the middle of}} June had a 2–6 record and a 5.90 ERA.

On August 10, 2010, Evancho performed the aria [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] in the show's quarter-final round. The judges' reactions were effusive. Afterwards, commentators queried whether her performance had been lip-synched. On the next evening's live show, Evancho sang an impromptu voice exercise {{to demonstrate that the}} broadcast was of her live voice. In an interview, judge Howie Mandel addressed the issue: [...] "hat people are ... really saying [...] that it's really <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{interest}} in Kabbalah inspired her {{to venture into}} the children's book market. Her Kabbalah teacher had suggested the singer to share her spiritual knowledge {{in the form of}} written stories. All the books included the lessons Madonna had learned in Kabbalah, teaching about strong morality and warning against greed and envy. A sequel for The English Roses was released in 2006, titled The English Roses: <b>Too</b> <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> True. Madonna also released a total of twelve chapter books for the series in 2007. Her success as a children's author was noted by Ed Pilkington from The Guardian, who believed that the singer [...] "lured a host of other celebrities and publishers into the [...] market".|$|E

500|$|Cooper's twenty-year {{friendship}} with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when {{he created the}} character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. The two shared {{a passion for the}} outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling—Cooper kept a copy of the poem [...] "If—" [...] in his dressing room—and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure. As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, [...] "If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true." [...] They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.|$|E

Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spoilt. It is time some people got out of it."

Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
500|$|... "My Man" [...] is a pop and R {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. described by Nick Levine of Digital Spy as a [...] "sassy R club banger". The song is notably different from her previous ballad, [...] "It's My Time", featuring a more contemporary R sound than the latter. Speaking upon {{the change in}} musical direction, Ewen clarified: [...] "What I'm now doing now is really me, [...] so if people don't like it I'm {{going to take it}} more personally." [...] "My Man" [...] opens with electro and bass-driven R beats, synthesizers that are reminiscent of those featured in [...] "Yeah!" [...] by Usher, and later develops into [...] "a pop/R stormer". The lyrical content of [...] "My Man" [...] is about a woman who [...] "pledges devotion to a man who sounds almost <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true". Ewen stated that the lyrics were not directed at any man in particular.|$|E

[...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian compared the chanting chorus to that of Justice vs. Simian's track, [...] "We Are Your Friends". He called it both [...] "ridiculously cool and a bit naff". In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true. The response from critics has been amazing. It's like being at school and being told ‘well done’ by the teachers but I want my classmates to like it too.

500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie is <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the end of the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E
