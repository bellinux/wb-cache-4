5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Whitney {{returns and}} she helps the Carters repair their new till. Johnny offers her {{the chance of}} moving back into the Vic, which Whitney accepts. Mick also offers her her old job back as a barmaid and Whitney accepts this too. However, Shirley warns Whitney {{to stay away from}} Mick and she tells Shirley that she cannot stop her from being at the Vic. In private, Whitney reveals to Mick that she is engaged to Woody and she shares the news with her family and friends. She asks Mick to give her away and he agrees. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> him for Whitney's sake and Whitney admits to Mick {{although}} she can't be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she figures out she's the one Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, Stacey's husband and Bianca's relative, Martin Fowler (James Bye) and their kids. Mick takes the rest of her stuff round and offers her £200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells him to keep his dirty money, annoyed with him revealing all.|$|E

In this way, she {{can be seen as a}} pioneer of {{contemporary}} approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.|$|E

Isolated punishments such as these clearly were not effective. Those drawbridges of defences were brought {{back as soon as}} it was thought to be politic.|$|E
25|$|In December 1776, Philippe Charles Tronson de Coudray and a {{group of}} French {{officers}} left for America on the Amphitrite. The ship was soon forced to turn back to France. Anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their journey, Lieutenant du Plessis and Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre went aboard the Mercure. Du Plessis paid 400 livres for the price of his passage. Carrying a secret cargo of military supplies, the vessel left Saint-Nazaire on 5 February 1777. The Mercure reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 17 March and de Borre arrived at Morristown, New Jersey exactly two months later. Appointed captain of artillery in the Continental Army, du Plessis' commission dated from 15 April 1777. He fought at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September.|$|E

25|$|Lord Sugar told Lewis and Gbemi {{they had}} been lucky to escape the boardroom, and that had {{either one of them}} been brought back instead of Harry M. or Zara they would have been fired over Hannah, as Lewis sold the {{smallest}} number of flowers on either team and contributed little to the task overall, whilst Gbemi was responsible for the team's overly conservative pricing (though Hannah inexplicably tried to claim that Gbemi made the £150 sale rather than Harry M., despite not being present herself and the footage showing otherwise). Lord Sugar saw no reason to fire Zara as she secured two of the three business deals and sold the most flowers, and despite his continued failure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his teammates, Harry M.'s salesmanship allowed him to continue the process, leaving a defenseless Hannah out of luck.|$|E
25|$|In Dark Magick Morgan was {{betrayed by}} the first boy she ever loved (Cal). Now Morgan must attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> her life. Morgan begins to study with Hunter, and slowly begins to realize her {{feelings}} for him. But dark magick seems to be surrounding them and someone close is to blame. Hunter and Morgan slowly start to get closer throughout the book. Hunter suspects that the dark magick is being used by David Redstone, owner of Practical Magick, and Morgan's friend. Morgan does everything she can to try and prove it was not him, but in the end, Hunter is right. The day before David gets stripped of his powers, Morgan and Hunter share a passionate kiss, and after Hunter strips David of his powers, he gives Morgan the stone Morganite, and it shows that Morgan is the thing/person that Hunter desires most in his heart.|$|E
25|$|Pat {{is forced}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> life. She begins a romance with another car dealer, Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), in 1995 and by November, {{they are living}} together. When Pat {{receives}} {{a letter from a}} psychiatric hospital saying Frank has recovered from a breakdown and wants to reunite, she tears up the letter. On Christmas Day 1995, Frank arrives unannounced and is furious to discover Pat is living with Roy. Frank declares he wants his house, business, and children back and refuses to leave Walford. Pat's son David Wicks (Michael French) contacts his lawyers and is relieved to discover Frank has no claim on the car lot; however, Ricky gives his share of the business to Frank who then threatens to sell Pat's house. Roy tries scaring Frank away via various underhanded tricks. In a moment of remorse, Frank threatens to confess his involvement in the arson attack to the police. Pat attempts to make him reconsider and this leads to them having sex. Pat regrets her actions but Frank takes great pleasure in telling Roy. Furious, Roy threatens to leave Pat; to stop him, she claims Frank is lying. She convinces Frank she doesn't love him; defeated, he leaves Walford in March 1996 and moves to Manchester.|$|E

25|$|But {{the main}} problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as {{uncritical}} {{as they had been}} when considering what they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered a large number of casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had, had begun the process of demobilisation and as such many regiments had lost almost all their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regiments serving in India. However, of these all but 10 (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Army (TA), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard fought campaign on the Indian frontier.|$|E

500|$|On {{its first}} showing on BBC Two, [...] "Séance Time" [...] was moved from Inside No. 9 usual slot on a Thursday evening. It was instead shown on Wednesday 29 April; this showing was at 10pm {{in most of}} the UK, and at 11.20pm in Northern Ireland. The {{freelance}} journalist Dan Owen suggested that this, combined with their refusal to release the series on Blu-ray, suggested that the BBC had little faith in Inside No. 9. He nonetheless called for a third series, a request echoed by other commentators. In their commentary on the episode, Pemberton said that he and Shearsmith had plans for a potential third series, and hoped to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> producing it. [...] "Séance Time", along with the other episodes from the second series, was released on DVD on 5 May 2016, and a third series was announced in October of that year.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "In My Place" [...] was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, {{and the way you}} look, and how you have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live.

500|$|Finkelstein {{grew up in}} Borough Park, then Mill Basin, both in Brooklyn, New York, where [...] he {{attended}} James Madison High School. In his memoir, Finkelstein recalls his strong youthful identification with the outrage that his mother, witness to the genocidal atrocities of World War II, felt at the carnage wrought by the United States in Vietnam. [...] One childhood friend recalls his mother's [...] "emotional investment in left-wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria". He had [...] "internalized [...] indignation", a trait which he admits rendered him [...] "insufferable" [...] when talking of the Vietnam War, and which imbued him with a [...] "holier-than-thou" [...] attitude at the time which he now regrets. But Finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother's outlook—the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> one's life—as a virtue. Subsequently, his reading of Noam Chomsky {{played an important role}} in tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1976, {{childhood}} friends Sumner and Hook separately {{attended a}} Sex Pistols {{show at the}} Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that {{he felt that the}} Pistols [...] "destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he [...] "knew he was all right <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in".|$|E
