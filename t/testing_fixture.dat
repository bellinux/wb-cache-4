50|$|Test {{fixtures}} {{can be set}} up {{in three}} ways: in-line setup, delegate setup, and implicit setup. In-line setup is where the developer creates the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in the same method {{as the rest of the}} test and is the simplest <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> to create but can lead to duplication if multiple tests need to use the same initial data. Delegate setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a separate standalone helper method that can be accessed by multiple test methods. Implicit setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a setup method which is used to set up multiple test methods. This is different from delegate setup in that the overall setup of multiple tests is in a single setup method where the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> gets created instead of each test method having its own setup procedures and linking to an external <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Identifying {{material}} characteristics of composites {{is important in}} designing any structural system. The aerospace industry relies on these material properties not only to design a functional aircraft, but also a safe and reliable one. Since carbon fiber composites are relatively new materials, {{little is known about}} its characteristics under certain loading conditions. The majority of previous research has been dedicated to inplane tension, bending, and shear loading. However, little to no research has been devoted to out-of-plane shear loading (Mode III) of notched panels. This document presents a novel approach to test and analyze panels loaded in Mode III. Literature provided some excellent inspiration for designing a feasible testing method. The proposed method consists of a <b>testing</b> <b>fixture,</b> as well as a testing procedure. One component of the <b>testing</b> <b>fixture</b> includes a hinged grip mechanism to apply load to the panel. The grips are clamped {{on each side of the}} notch and then loaded in opposite directions. The hinge gives the system a rotational degree of freedom and helps eliminate any unwanted damage near the grips. This creates high stress concentrations at the notch tip. To validate this testing method, six different ply layups were analyzed. Each ply layup was tested using six repeated specimens to show consistency between similar panels. The optical method, digital image correlation (DIC), provided a full-field strain measurement of the region of interest every two seconds throughout the test. Specific strain concentrations, secondary strain buildup, and early fracture patterns were extracted from the digital image correlation results. Along with strain patterns, applied load and grip displacement was recorded using the Bluehill® software. Information about the stiffness of the panel, maximum applied load, and work to maximum load was correlated with the number of 0 -degree plies of each panel...|$|E

The samples were secured in a microtensile <b>testing</b> <b>fixture</b> (Odeme Biotechnology, Joaçaba, SC, Brazil) using cyanoacrylate-based adhesive (Super Bonder Gel, Loctite, Itapevi, SP, Brazil) and tested in a universal testing machine (EMIC DL 2000, São José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil) at a crosshead speed of 0.5  mm/min. The rationale behind microtensile bond strength methodology [12] is that the higher the actual bonding capacity of an adhesive, the better it will withstand such stresses and the longer the restoration would survive clinically [10].|$|E

40|$|In many {{industrial}} stamping operations, {{the sheet}} material {{is subject to}} a series of loading and reverse loading cycles. In order to accurately predict the outcome of such forming processes, numerical simulation models rely on advanced constitutive models to rigorously reproduce the cyclic work hardening behaviour of the sheet material.

A suitable specimen geometry and a corresponding loading fixture were designed and fabricated. Cyclic shear tests were successfully carried out on four different grades of automotive sheet steel using this new <b>testing</b> <b>fixture</b> mounted in a universal testing machine.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Advisors: Terri Fiez, Karti Mayaram. Committee members: Andreas Weisshaar, David Hackleman. At {{frequencies}} exceeding 1 - 2 GHz, {{the substrate}} network models used in substrate coupling simulation must {{account for the}} reactive nature of the substrate. Unlike at low frequencies, where the purely resistive substrate models can be validated through DC resistance measurements, these high-frequency models, comprising reactive components, must be validated through high-frequency network analyzer measurements.

40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) Abstract: The {{document}} {{reports on}} research conducted on titanium bolt assemblies {{pertaining to the}} surface friction behaviour between the sliding surfaces of a screw and nut within a fastener assembly. The research was motivated by problems encountered in the dental implant industry whereby the prescribed preload after application of the fixation torque was not achieved. The insufficient preload in the abutment screw led to implant failure due to the dynamic nature of its maxillofacial function and resulting in tissue growth into micro-spaces because of joint separation between the abutment and implant. Commercially pure Grade 4 titanium screws were sulphurically anodised to various oxide layer thicknesses {{in an attempt to}} reduce the coefficient of friction within the implant assembly. Testing procedures involved the design and manufacturing of the experimental specimen and <b>testing</b> <b>fixture,</b> anodising of screws, friction coefficient measurement, oxide layer thickness measurement, surface hardness measurement, and surface typography investigation. The design process of the specimen and the <b>testing</b> <b>fixture</b> included various FEA (Finite element analysis) in optimising both of the aforementioned systems of the research and conclusively generate accurate results and findings to compare with each other. Oxide layer thickness measurement was conducted by wavelength reflectance theory and visual measurement of the oxide layer using a scanning electron microscope. The surface hardness of the material was measured using a Vickers hardness tester while surface typography investigation was performed using a scanning electron microscope. Findings of the experiments revealed that the coefficient of friction reduces by 10 % to 40 % as the anodising voltage is increased up to an oxide layer thickness of 0. 4 μm, where after the surface friction coefficient increases to eventually surpass the coefficient of friction for untreated fastener assemblies. Untightening examination exhibited similar behaviour to fixation, where the removal friction coefficient reduces to attain a minimum of 0. 69 at an oxide thickness of 0. 06 μm. The untightening coefficient of friction was at a maximum at the increased oxide layer thicknesses of 0. 97 μm to 3. 4 μm. Oxide layer thickness investigation revealed that the thickness of the oxide layer increases exponentially as the anodising voltage is increased. The increase in anodising voltage also [...] ...|$|E
