5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} theory {{increased}} {{through the end of}} the 1940s.

These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.|$|E

The bank was inaugurated on February 1, 1890, with Juan Róspide y Navarro and José Manuel López Sainz as governor and vice governor respectively. The Royal Decree permitted the issuing of paper money in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 pesos. These banknotes were manufactured by the American Bank Note Company. The original bank {{was located in}} San Juan, with a second one being established in Mayagüez in 1894. Until 1898, the institution issued four series A, B, C and D, though apparently C was put into production after D and didn't circulate under Spanish control.

In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role.

40|$|The {{demographic}} explosion recorded {{worldwide in}} the last century and also the increasing level of living had as result the constantly increasing of the meat requirements. The researches were made in a company from the city of Vaslui, on two groups of half-breed <b>lambs</b> obtained from <b>the</b> crossing of females of Merinos de Palas with males of Ile de France. At the first group the supplementary feeding started when <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> were 10 days old, when in their food it was provided, in specially arranged places, high quality hayand concentrated forage made in the farm, containing 50 % corn, 40 % oat and 10 % pea, ad libitum. The second group was fed supplementary starting at the age of 10 days, when the lams food was provided, in specially arranged places, high quality hay and compound grain forage for lambs given on discretion. In the period of 10 - 40 days in <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> food it was administrated compound grain forage “starter” which provides a level of the protein of 16 % and a minimum level of phosphorus of 0, 45 % and in the period of 40 - 60 days it was administrated in <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> food compound grain forage “grower” which provides a level of the protein of 15, 8 % and a minimum level of phosphorus of 0, 40 %. At the age of 30 days as well at the age of 60 days <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> from <b>the</b> second group had accomplished body weights higher than <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> from <b>the</b> first group.

5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live.
