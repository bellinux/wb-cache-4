5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district and was driving around because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> area.|$|E
5|$|As the sun, the Eye of Ra is {{a source}} of heat and light, and it is {{associated}} with fire and flames. It is also equated with <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> that appears before sunrise, and with the morning star that precedes and signals the sun's arrival.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
40|$|Red {{warning lights}} {{delineate}} the runway approach with additional blue <b>lights</b> juxtaposed with <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> such that <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are chromatically balanced. The red/blue point light sources {{result in the}} phenomenon that <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> appear {{in front of the}} blue lights with about one and one-half times the diameter of the blue. To a pilot observing these lights along a glide path, those <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> directly below appear to be nearer than the blue lights. For those lights farther away seen in perspective at oblique angles, <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> appear {{to be in a position}} closer to the pilot and hence appear to be above the corresponding blue lights. This produces a very pronounced three dimensional effect referred to as chromostereopsis which provides valuable visual cues to enable the pilot to perceive his actual position above the ground and the actual distance to the runway...|$|R

5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. <b>The</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of {{qualifying}} started problematically, as <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> {{at the end of}} the pitlane, indicating that cars had to stop, was still on when the clock began to run. A marshal with a green flag then indicated the drivers to take to the track. During the session, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, but a mistake by Nico Rosberg meant that Vettel was able to place second. Daniil Kvyat was the first driver to be eliminated, lining up behind the two McLaren drivers, with debutant Vandoorne out-qualifying his teammate Button. Nico Hülkenberg was the only driver to go out to improve his time, managing to proceed into Q3 in eighth place, leaving Grosjean, Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr. behind.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath has one {{professional}} football team, Arbroath, who play in Scottish League One, the third tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Arbroath play their home matches at Gayfield Park, which holds {{the record for}} being the closest stadium to the sea in European football (around 5½ yards from the high tide line). Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Further goals were disallowed either for offside, or {{because it was not}} clear whether the ball had gone into the goal. For this reason the AFC supporters' club is called the 36–0 club in memory of this event. Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC.|$|E

25|$|When {{the safety}} {{car and the}} drivers behind it are on the start/finish straight, there is a red light at the exit of the pit lane. Drivers who go past <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> are disqualified from the race. This has {{happened}} to several drivers during the years, such as Giancarlo Fisichella and Felipe Massa in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. At the same race a year later, Lewis Hamilton failed to notice <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> and slammed {{into the back of}} the car of Kimi Räikkönen, who was waiting at the end of the pit lane alongside Robert Kubica.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the city}} of Amsterdam started a project to improve <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> {{district}} in the old city centre. Noten participated with a street vending machine that sold red rings {{with a wide variety}} of designs for only €2.50. The rings were intended to be bought for the neighbourhood prostitutes by their clients. Noten called the project Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that it might even introduce a more romantic atmosphere in <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for €310.00 each.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{software}} user manual of IVE, {{the speed of}} a fleet of vehicles that as an input parameter in this model, is movement speed not travel speed [18]. For this reason, the fleet velocity of this intersection, the stop time of the vehicles caused by <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> was ignored. These numbers show the dominant speed of the cars 50  m before and after the intersections at two intersecting streets obtained by the distance and time (minus <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> interval). <b>The</b> results of the average approximate speed of vehicles on research days are presented in Appendix Table 6.|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands 114 {{collisions}} between {{train and}} road users took place annually {{during the last}} five years, resulting in an average of 51 deaths and 38 injuries. Sometimes the collisions are regarded simply {{as a consequence of}} red- light violations. In road- side interviews on level crossings protected by flashing lights only, 12 % of users of these crossings admitted ignoring <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> "once". Two categories road users admitted ignoring <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> signficantly more: regularly users and (young) cyclists and moped riders.

25|$|In the European Union {{member states}} in general, {{it is illegal}} to turn on a red light, unless it is {{indicated}} otherwise, for example by a green arrow on a red light, a flashing amber arrow with a red light or a permanent green board next to <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the National Gallery in London mounted an {{exhibition}} of The Hoerengracht (Dutch: Whores' Canal), a 1980s streetscape installation portraying <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district of Amsterdam, Holland. From May 6 to June 19, 2010, Kienholz's Roxy's (1960) was meticulously reconstructed and visible through the aperture of two panoramic windows at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{days later}} the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any {{establishment}} of the district which served alcohol, that no women – employees or patrons – would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden. As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became straight saloons, while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or closed dance halls, but they never regained their previous popularity. In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Light</b> Abatement Act, {{but by that time}} all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished. Following <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Light</b> Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the Tenderloin and Union Square as shopping centers took over.|$|E
5000|$|In international-level motorsport, races with rolling starts are {{typically}} {{started by the}} starter changing <b>the</b> starting <b>lights</b> from <b>red</b> to green after a specified number of green flag pace laps behind either a lead car or safety car. In this case <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are pre-illuminated {{part of the way}} around the final pace lap and are changed to green once the starter is happy with the composition of the field. International rolling starts may be aborted by leaving <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> illuminated and <b>the</b> displaying of an [...] "Extra Formation Lap" [...] board and/or flashing yellow lights.|$|R

50|$|The {{scenes of}} Walter Jameson's aging was {{performed}} by using an old movie-making trick. Age lines were drawn on actor Kevin McCarthy's face in <b>red</b> make-up. During <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> scene, <b>red</b> <b>lighting</b> was used, bathing <b>the</b> scene in <b>red</b> and hiding <b>the</b> age lines. As the scene progressed, <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> were turned down and green lights were brought up. Under <b>the</b> green <b>lights,</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> age lines were prominent. The lighting changes were unseen by the audience because it was filmed in black-and-white. The ultimate result is {{the appearance of a}} complete make-up change with no cuts to the scene.|$|R
25|$|Crows {{in urban}} Japan and the United States have innovated a {{technique}} to crack hard-shelled nuts by dropping them onto crosswalks and letting them be run over and cracked by cars. They then retrieve the cracked nuts when the cars are stopped at <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> Macaws {{have been shown to}} utilize rope to fetch items that would normally be difficult to reach. Striated herons (Butorides striatus) use bait to catch fish.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania, {{drivers are}} allowed to turn right on red when a {{particular}} sign with a green arrow on a white background is mounted beside <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> of the traffic signal.
