5|$|The {{bridge of}} 1685 {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} Williamite War in Ireland of the 17th century and was used by Patrick Sarsfield to retreat to Connacht after his ambush of a Williamite convoy at Ballyneety in Co. Limerick during the Siege of Limerick. Because of its affording Sarsfield and his army a method of advance and retreat, the old bridge was {{often referred to as}} Sarsfield's Bridge. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> was blown up in 1843 by gunpowder by a section of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The abutment of <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> can still be seen adjacent to Cromwell's Castle on the Connacht side of the river.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is named}} in honor and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> serves the public, let us not forget the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> new <b>bridge</b> is {{sometimes}} called North Torrey Pines Bridge, although that same name {{is sometimes}} applied to the taller arch bridge immediately to its north. <b>This</b> lower <b>bridge</b> over the lagoon inlet was built by Flatiron and cost $9,628,750.|$|R
50|$|A steel two-hinged {{arch bridge}} {{with a single}} span of 42 metres was added in 1907 {{stretching}} over the older <b>bridge.</b> <b>This</b> second <b>bridge</b> was repaired in 1930-1933 and 1952-1953.|$|R

5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was used by}} George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the New York and Boston Air Line Railroad. The details on <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> are largely unknown, but contradictory evidence exists placing {{the construction of the}} bridge between 1876 and 1877. According to Marshall, the Air Line Railroad was completed in 1873 and the Colchester branch was completed in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had {{to replace it with}} a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long {{concrete}} tee {{beam bridge}} was built; <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long {{bridge of the}} same type {{was built in the}} same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built in 2010 and carries State Route 1027/Layton Road over the creek.|$|E
5|$|Made up of two road {{bridges and}} a railway bridge located over {{a section of}} water known as The Narrows, located between Mill Point and Point Lewis, it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways, linking the city's {{northern}} and southern suburbs. The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world. Construction of the northern interchange for <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> necessitated the reclamation of {{a large amount of}} land from the river.|$|E
5|$|NY16 now {{follows the}} narrow valley of Ischua Creek, {{one of the}} Olean's tributaries, north past {{the road to the}} city's airport, north to Franklinville.

5|$|Since iron was {{becoming}} cheaper and more plentiful, it {{also became a}} major structural material following {{the building of the}} innovative first iron bridge in 1778. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines. Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italien and German) refer to railways as iron road.|$|E
5|$|The A82 runs {{towards the}} centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 {{continues}} along the western shore of the loch up to the Bridge of Oich at its northern end. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade's Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at a swing bridge next to the locks in the village.|$|E
5|$|The Aldford Approach {{leads from}} the village of Aldford and crosses the River Dee by the GradeI listed Aldford Iron Bridge, which was built in 1824 by William Hazledine for the 1stMarquis.

40|$|Abstract: The EU {{has tried}} to bridge {{decision}} making by qualified majority and unanimity {{over the years by}} expanding qualified majorities (consensus) or by making unanimities easier to achieve. I call this decision-making procedure q-"unanimity" andtrace its history from the Luxembourg compromise to the Lisbon Treaty, and to more recent agreements. I analyze the most recent and explicit mechanism of <b>this</b> <b>bridging</b> (article 31 (2) of the Lisbon Treaty) and identify one specific means by which the transformation of qualified majorities to unanimities is achieved: the reduction of precision or scope of the decision, so that different behaviors can be covered by it. I provide empirical evidence of such a mechanism by analyzing legislative decisions. Finally, I argue that <b>this</b> <b>bridging</b> is a ubiquitous feature of EU institutions, used in Treaties as well as in legislative decision-making. ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{railway bridge}} to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk Railway {{bridge across the}} Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built {{simultaneously}} across the West Channel, <b>this</b> <b>bridge</b> provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It was not until 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built across the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Perrot Island {{was the only way}} out of Montreal to the West before the construction of √éle aux Tourtes Bridge, which goes directly to Vaudreuil across the Lake of Two Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{crosses the}} Colorado River {{at the site}} of the Dewey Bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> was the longest {{suspension}} bridge in Utah until April 2008 when it was destroyed by a fire started by a child playing with matches.

5|$|The {{original}} railroad {{bridge was}} replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that, along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River, was one of the United States' first all steel railroad bridges. <b>This</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed from Bessemer steel, which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position, allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27¬Ω hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|E
