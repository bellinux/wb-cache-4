The five-minute Radio 4 UK Theme composed by Fritz Spiegl followed this for 28 years until April 2006.

After a continuity link and programme trail there are a shipping forecast, weather reports from coastal stations for 04:00 GMT and the inshore waters forecasts, followed at 05:30 by a news bulletin, a review of British and international newspapers, and a business report.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, {{nineteen}} men hijacked four airliners all bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners, they told the passengers {{that they had a}} bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it had never happened before in history, and many previous hijacking attempts had been resolved with the passengers and crew escaping unharmed after obeying the hijackers. The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the White House or the U.S. Capitol. None of the flights had any survivors. A total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks. Fifteen of the nineteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.|$|E

500|$|To further {{complicate the}} practice, the ascent rate may {{vary with the}} depth, and is {{typically}} faster at greater depth and reduces as the depth gets shallower. In practice a continuous decompression profile may be approximated by ascent in steps as small as the chamber pressure gauge will resolve, and timed to follow the theoretical profile as closely as conveniently practicable. [...] For example, USN treatment table 7 (which may be used if decompression sickness has reoccurred during initial treatment in the compression chamber) states [...] "Decompress with stops every 2 feet for times shown in profile below." [...] The profile shows an ascent rate of 2fsw every 40min from 60fsw (feet of sea water) to 40fsw, followed by 2ft every hour from 40fsw to 20fsw and 2ft every <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> 20fsw to 4fsw.|$|E

In his 1952 autobiography Talking Football, Ramsey would describe [...] "liv for the open air from the moment I could toddle", spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a tennis ball. From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to 14. He and his brothers had to walk <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> their house to get there, and passed a ball between {{each other on the}} way to break the monotony.
