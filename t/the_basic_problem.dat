25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> is {{that the}} {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And {{by the time it}} finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E

25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally materialâ€”this is <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> of causal interaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> facing {{designers}} of color televisions was this: Sending each {{frame of the}} moving image meant sending three signals, red, green and blue. The sequential systems, like Baird's earlier efforts, sent the three images one after another. In order for motion to appear smooth, images must change at least 16 times a second. To reduce flicker, over 40 frames per second (fps) is mandatory. In sequential systems, each color requires a separate field. For this reason, very high refresh (field) rates were necessary. CBS' system refreshed at 144fps. (Peter Goldmark's CBS team tried several field rates. Within the 6 MHz allowable channel bandwidth, the most acceptable rate was 144 fps. This rate made pictures incompatible with existing systems working at 50 or 60Hz.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out what kinds of issues related to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problems</b> of accounting exist in the M&A performance evaluation. The objective is also to research how those problems can affect the evaluation of M&A performance and what kinds of principles should be taken into account in order to solve those problems. These effects can be either affecting the process of the performance evaluation or affecting the performance of the M&A case. This study also aims to get a deeper insight into <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problems</b> of accounting that need to be solved in order to gain better understanding of the performance evaluation. METHODOLOGY AND DATA The research method is a qualitative single case study. The empirical data was mainly collected through seven semi-structured interviews of personnel working with mergers and acquisitions in the case company. MAIN FINDINGS The main conclusion of the study is that <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problems</b> of accounting can have a substantial impact on the evaluation of M&A performance. If the problems are not solved, it can lead to a situation where the performance evaluation cannot be done in a reliable way. If the reliability of the performance evaluation of M&A is questioned, the evaluation adds no value into assessing whether M&A case was successful or not. It was also discovered that there are some other problems, for example cultural issues, that might have an effect on the M&A performance evaluation in addition to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problems</b> of accounting. This means that even though all <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problems</b> are solved, <b>the</b> evaluation process might still be unsuccessful to produce a valuable outcome...|$|R

25|$|Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> is that through {{intensive}} studies {{of thousands of}} detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones.

Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), {{they will not be able}} to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> with {{estimating}} a gas {{allowance for}} contingencies {{is to decide}} what contingencies to allow for. This is addressed in the risk assessment for the planned dive. A commonly considered contingency is to share gas with another diver from {{the point in the}} dive where the maximum time is needed to reach the surface or other place where more gas is available. It is likely that both divers will have a higher than normal RMV during an assisted ascent as it is a stressful situation. It is prudent to take this into account. The values should be chosen according to recommendations of the code of practice in use or the training agency, but if a higher value is chosen it is unlikely that anyone would object. Recreational divers may have the discretion to use RMV values of their own choice, based on personal experience and informed acceptance of risk.|$|E

But <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> proved insoluble.

The Government leaders were unwilling to permit Communist participation in the Government until the Communists had given up their armed forces, while the Communists believed that to do so without guarantees of their legal political status would end in their destruction.|$|E
