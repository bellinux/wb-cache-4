500|$|In interviews, Stevens {{stated that}} during 2009–2010 he {{suffered}} from a mysterious debilitating viral infection that affected his nervous system. He experienced chronic pain, {{and was forced to}} stop working on music for several months. He said: [...] "The Age of Adz, is, in some ways, a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> physical self. That's why I think the record's really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{signed for}} League One side Stevenage on 27 June 2011. He joined the club on a free transfer, rejecting a {{contract}} extension at Accrington. He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> agent and discussed the offer and when I thought I had the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough.

2500|$|On 18 April, the {{cardinals}} assembled in St. Peter's Basilica {{in the morning}} to concelebrate the mass Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice (For the Election of the Roman Pontiff). As Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was the principal concelebrant. He chose to give the homily himself. In the afternoon, {{the cardinals}} assembled in the Hall of Blessings for the procession to the Sistine Chapel. The cardinals proceeded to the Sistine Chapel while the Litany of Saints was chanted. After taking their places the [...] "Veni Creator Spiritus" [...] ("Come, Creator Spirit") was sung. Cardinal Ratzinger read the oath. Each cardinal elector beginning with Ratzinger, followed by Vice Dean Angelo Sodano and the other cardinals in order of seniority, affirmed the oath by placing his hands on the book of the Gospels saying aloud: [...] "And I, , do so promise, pledge and swear.

In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|William York of AllMusic wrote, [...] "the tracks {{here could}} best be {{described}} as miniature audio movies." [...] Christian Renner of Metal Crypt praised the album as being [...] "overall another excellent album worthy of extremely high praise and what would be a masterpiece for most bands turns out to be just another great album from the genius that is Opeth." [...] Jim Raggi of Lamentations of the Flame Princess said that [...] "this is still the most perfect album ever recorded." [...] He also stated [...] "the more personal nature of the lyrics on Morningrise are another thing that make it a much more intense listen than the stories that would follow. It's incredible how everything changed after this album. The lineup, the style, the lyrics... Opeth has never released less than an excellent album. But they have only released one perfect album." [...] Drew Schinzel of Chronicles of Chaos said that the songs are [...] "melodic and well played, with great vocals and the occasional guitar solo".

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
