The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of justifying the use of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> in the technology of minced meat canned products of special purpose. The key criterion determined the specialized purpose of canned food is the high content of physiologically functional food ingredient of chondroitin sulfate in the cartilage of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> wings. The high content of chondroitin sulfate in raw materials ensures that the content of the physiologically functional ingredient in the finished canned food will be at the level from 220 to 250 mg per 100 g of product. The method of IR blanching is presented for removing urea from the <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> muscle tissue. To confirm the efficiency of the developed method of urea removal, it has been proposed to use a modified photocolorimetric method for determination of mass fractions of urea in feed flour according to the governmental standard GOST R 50032 – 92 "Feed flour made of fish, marine mammals, crustaceans and invertebrates. Methods of determining the mass fraction of urea and calculation of the crude protein with a given mass fraction of carbamide".

40|$|The <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja radiata) {{is a large}} {{species of}} skate that is endemic to {{the waters of the}} western north Atlantic in the Gulf of Maine. Because the biomass of thorny skates has {{recently}} declined below threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act, commercial harvests from this region are prohibited. We have undertaken a comprehensive study to gain insight into the life history of this skate. The present study describes and characterizes the reproductive cycle of female and male thorny skates, based on monthly samples taken off the coast of New Hampshire, from May 2001 to May 2003. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), shell gland weight, follicle size, and egg case formation, were assessed for 48 female skates. In general, these reproductive parameters remained relatively constant throughout most of the year. However, transient but significant increases in shell gland weight and GSI were obser ved during certain months. Within the cohort of specimens sampled monthly throughout the year, a subset of females always had large preovulatory follicles present in their ovaries. With the exception of June and September specimens, egg cases undergoing various stages of development were observed in the uteri of specimens captured during all other months of the year. For males (n= 48), histological stages III through VI (SIII−SVI) of spermatogenesis, GSI, and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were examined. Although there appeared to be monthly fluctuations in spermatogenesis, GSI, and HSI, no significant differences were found.

40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five skate species- thorny (Amblyraja radiata), Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for thorny and Arctic skates were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for smooth skate. Round skate has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for Arctic skate. Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. <b>Thorny</b> <b>skate</b> showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and round skate did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO. <b>Thorny</b> <b>skate</b> appear as dominant predator in NAFO Div. 3 NO...|$|E
40|$|From stomachs of cod (Gadus morhua), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> (Raja radiata) sampled in {{the fishing}} surveys {{carried out in}} Flemish Cap in July from 1993 to 1998, the {{importance}} in diet, predator-prey relationship and length frequency of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) were evaluated. These three species prey on different lengths of northern shrimp {{as a function of}} their feeding habits and the overlap in their ranges of vertical distribution with that of their prey. The ability of these predators to sample different sizes of northern shrimp allows the observation of the annual progression of strong year classes of this prey and the estimate of its recruitment at age 2 from its frequency of occurrence in cod stomach contents from 1989 to 1997...|$|E
