[...] This was the first that the newspaper reporters had heard of speed and tonnage competition between divisions at Port Chicago, and each reporter filed a story featuring this revelation to be published the next day. Naval authorities quickly issued a statement denying Green's allegation.|$|E
500|$|All Hands on the Bad One is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed fourth album The Hot Rock, released in 1999. The Hot Rock marked a considerable {{change in the}} band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. It {{was also the first}} Sleater-Kinney album that entered the US Billboard Top 200 chart, peaking at number 181. Some fans, however, dismissed the album, claiming that the band had sold out and that it was a commercial album. This criticism was something that singer and guitarist Corin Tucker strongly disagreed with, claiming that The Hot Rock was their least commercial album due to its longer and intricate pieces. According to Tucker, [...] "we wanted to be doing difficult work. We wanted to be expanding as musicians and people didn't want that from us. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to jump around and yell." ...|$|E

[...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie , sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And she turned to me and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E

6000|$|One party {{attracted}} {{our attention}} {{as soon as}} we went aboard. It was made up of a lady and two gentlemen-hunters. The lady wasn't a hunter, but she was dressed in a suitable costume to go about with fellows who had on hunting-clothes. The men wore long yellow boots that came ever so far up their legs, and they had on all the belts and hunting-fixings that the law allows. The lady wore yellow gloves, to match the men's boots. As we were going up the St. John's, the two men strode about, in an easy kind of a way, as if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to understand that this sort of thing was nothing to them. They were used to it, and could wear that style of boots every day if they wanted to. Rectus called them [...] "the yellow-legged party," [...] which wasn't a bad name.|$|E
