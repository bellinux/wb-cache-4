40|$|In this paper, a broad {{qualitative}} {{description of}} GPS-based radio occultation technique for the Earth atmosphere limb sounding is given and some equations {{in the recovery}} of temperature are summarized. Based on a simple software developed in this work, some quantitative results on this topic are provided. The sensitivity of this technique to orbit errors of GPS and LEO satellites is investigated particularly. Some conclusions are derived as follows. Although a constant extra path delay error due to inaccurate POD information {{has no effect on}} the retrieved temperature in radio occultation technique, orbit errors of GPS and LEO satellites, especially for LEO, can result in <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> that are not negligible. <b>Temperature</b> <b>errors</b> grow very rapidly with the increasing of the impact height of the ray. The lower LEO orbit altitude, the larger <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> are, at the same height and given the same orbit accuracy. There exists an approximately linear relationship between <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> and the orbit errors of LEO satellite at each specific height. For upcoming CHAMP satellite, <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> are expected to be less than 1 K below 50 km of the minimum ray height if 10 cm orbit accuracy can be obtained in the post-processed case.

5000|$|Before {{developing}} Elinvar, Guillaume also invented an alloy {{to compensate}} for middle <b>temperature</b> <b>error</b> in bimetallic balances by endowing it with a negative quadratic temperature coefficient. This alloy, named anibal, is a slight variation of invar. It almost completely negated the temperature effect of the steel hairspring, but still required a bimetal compensated balance wheel, known as a Guillaume balance wheel. This design later fell out of use in favor of single metal Invar balances with Elinvar springs.

50|$|Spring scales {{have two}} sources of error that {{balances}} do not: the measured weight {{varies with the}} strength of the local gravitational force (by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth), and the elasticity of the measurement spring can vary slightly with temperature. With proper manufacturing and setup, however, spring scales can be rated as legal for commerce. To remove the <b>temperature</b> <b>error,</b> a commerce-legal spring scale must either have temperature-compensated springs or be used at a fairly constant temperature. To eliminate the effect of gravity variations, a commerce-legal spring scale must be calibrated where it is used.|$|E
50|$|In the 1720s, the English clockmaker Henry Sully {{invented a}} marine clock that was {{designed}} to determine longitude: this was {{in the form of a}} clock with a large balance wheel that was vertically mounted on friction rollers and impulsed by a frictional rest Debaufre type escapement. Very unconventionally, the balance oscillations were controlled by a weight at the end of a pivoted horizontal lever attached to the balance by a cord. This solution avoided <b>temperature</b> <b>error</b> due to thermal expansion, a problem which affects steel balance springs. Sully's clock only kept accurate time in calm weather, because the balance oscillations were affected by the pitching and rolling of the ship. However his clocks were amongst the first serious attempts to find longitude in this way. Harrison's machines, though much larger, are of similar layout: H3 has a vertically mounted balance wheel and is linked to another wheel of the same size, an arrangement that eliminates problems arising from the ship's motion.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} resolution capabilities or the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) {{and the proposed}} GOES Itigh-resolution Interferometer Sounder (GillS) were considered with regard to temperatures at and near the ground surface. Simulated retrievals were performed, along with experiments on the sensitivity of radiances to profile perturbations. For a moderately moist atmosphere, ground surface <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> of about V°C and low-level air <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> of about 3 'C can occur in VAS retrievals due specifically to {{vertical resolution}} limitations and instrument noise. For a drier atmosphere the surface <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> tend to be smaller and the low-level air <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> tend to be larger. It appears that these vertical-resoluCon-related retrieval errors can be reduced {{by a factor of}} about 70 - 90 % by going from VAS to an instrument with performance specifications such as those of GillS. These results also imply that, a high-spectral-resolution instrument can perform significantly better than VAS in the task of estimating cloud top heights and temperatures for low clouds. I.

40|$|This study {{utilizes}} a model-generated {{data set}} {{to evaluate the}} errors associated with the diagnosis of geopotential height using three approximate forms of the divergence equation (DE). The DE was solved on the original sigma-coordinate surfaces of the model to exclude any error produced {{in the process of}} interpolating the data from observation points to the coordinate surface of the DE. An inviscid, nonlinear, divergent DE produced rms geopotential height errors as large as 3 m and rms <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> of over 26 C in the lower planetary boundary layer (PBL), with minimal errors above 800 mb. Elimination of the isobaric divergence in the velocity field caused additional height errors of 5 - 6 m and <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> of 0. 4 - 1. 2 C in the free troposphere. Use of a further-degraded DE without nonlinear terms caused height errors of 10 - 15 m in the upper troposphere with modestly increased <b>temperature</b> <b>errors.</b> Error fields at all levels had synoptic-scale features, with some mesoalpha structure. No spatial noise was apparent.

5000|$|Modern (2007) watch balance {{wheels are}} usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal {{expansion}} alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal coefficient of elasticity alloy such as Nivarox. [...] The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower <b>temperature</b> <b>error.</b> The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. [...] Balance wheels rotate about 1½ turns with each swing, that is, about 270° to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds {{the part of the}} spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant vibration rate of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‘free sprung’ balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight screws on the balance rim. A balance's vibration rate is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. [...] Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. [...] Audemars Piguet currently produces a movement that allows for a very high balance vibration of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). [...] The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which by WWII had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day.|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} and orientation system (POS) {{is a key}} equipment for airborne remote sensing systems, which provides high-precision position, velocity, and attitude information for various imaging payloads. <b>Temperature</b> <b>error</b> is the main source that affects the precision of POS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Volumetric {{thermometry}} {{with fine}} spatiotemporal resolution is desirable to monitor MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) {{procedures in the}} brain, but requires some form of accelerated imaging. Accelerated MR temperature imaging methods have been developed that undersample k-space and leverage signal correlations over time to suppress the resulting undersampling artifacts. However, in transcranial MRgFUS treatments, the water bath surrounding the skull creates signal variations that do not follow those correlations, leading to <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> in the brain due to signal aliasing. METHODS: To eliminate <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> due to the water bath, a spatially-segmented iterative reconstruction method was developed. The method fits a k-space hybrid signal model to reconstruct temperature changes in the brain, and a conventional MR signal model in the water bath. It was evaluated using single-channel 2 DFT Cartesian, golden angle radial, and spiral data from gel phantom heating, and in vivo 8 -channel 2 DFT data from a FUS thalamotomy.

40|$|Given the {{temperature}} dependence of {{various aspects of}} light-emitting diode (LED) performance, LED temperature sensing is becoming increasingly important in solid-state lighting applications.

While it leads to higher <b>temperature</b> <b>errors</b> than existing electrical techniques, which use the linear relationship between voltage and temperature at a fixed current, the proposed technique {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce calibration costs, as it requires calibration at only one temperature instead of two for existing techniques.
