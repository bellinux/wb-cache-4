5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{retelling of}} the Exodus to one's child {{is the object}} of the Seder experience, much effort is made to arouse the {{interest}} and curiosity of the children and keep them awake during the meal. To that end, questions and answers are a central device in the Seder ritual. By encouraging children to ask questions, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> open to hearing the answers.|$|E
25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E

Continuing her blackmail of Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Sue has Madonna tracks played over the school intercom throughout the day. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) overhears {{the girls in}} the club discussing difficulties they are having in relationships and life. Rachel (Lea Michele) asks the other girls for advice on a boy pressuring her to have sex, while Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) tells them that Artie (Kevin McHale) has asked her to start wearing more revealing clothes if she wants to be with him. When Will observes the Cheerios performing a routine with stilts to [...] "Ray of Light", he is inspired to set a Madonna-themed assignment to restore the girls to equal status.

2500|$|Nick and Sharon {{remained}} {{apart for}} a number of months. However, they worked together in court to legally adopt Cassie as their own. Nick moved back into the family home, Case explained [...] "Neither knew what the other wanted. So, Sharon went to bed and Nick slept on the couch." [...] During this time, they reconnected and eventually got back together, as Nick grew even closer to Cassie as his own daughter. The show's then head-writer at the time Kay Alden, said [...] "This {{has been a long time}} coming for Sharon and Nick [...] For the last several months, there's been a lot of stop-and-go — and mixed messages — between them. But now the feelings they have for each other are definitely clear." [...] Sharon and Nick were awarded custody of Cassie, and Nick adopted Cassie and became her father. Joshua Morrow stated: [...] "Nick has accepted Cassie as his daughter. He loves her as much as he loves Noah. She's an incredible child and Nick is crazy about her". Of their reunion, Case said: [...] "Happiness doesn't just mean lying around in bed saying, 'I love you' everyday for the rest of their lives. Love expresses itself in other ways. One way is getting over the hurdles of life together. So, I'm sure <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> hurdles to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goal {{congruence}} {{also plays}} a role in influencing the relationship between one's core self-evaluations and the satisfaction one has with one's job. The theory behind goal congruence argues that people who choose self-concordant (i.e., congruent) goals will be happier with the goals they pursue, be more likely to put in effort towards achieving these goals, and, consequently, {{will be more likely to}} attain their goals. Self-concordant goals include goals that focus on intrinsic factors. [...] For example, a person pursuing a self-concordant goal will choose a goal that they feel is personally important, and that they will enjoy. On the other hand, goals that are non-self-concordant will focus on more external factors. [...] A person who chooses a non-self-concordant goal will focus on avoiding negative emotions (e.g., anxiety or guilt), satisfying someone else's wishes, or on external rewards, like money. [...] Judge, Bono, Erez, and Locke (2005) found that goal congruence, or choosing self-concordant goals, partially mediates the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] The authors explain that individuals with positive self-regard (i.e. high core self-evaluations) believe themselves to be capable and competent and will be less likely to be affected by external factors; thus, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to choose self-concordant goals, which will lead to higher satisfaction. [...] On the other hand, individuals with negative self- regard will be susceptible to external factors like anxiety and guilt. [...] These people will be more likely to pursue non-self-concordant goals and will report lower job satisfaction.|$|E
