5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> or the other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E

5|$|Lea {{took him}} <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and {{informed}} {{him of the}} charges, but Corder denied all knowledge of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought {{on the day of}} the murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained warnings about the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E
5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths. It is not true that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the back-to-back fireplaces, but {{no evidence of}} this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic {{was used as a}} flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are off <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> rather than going through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory.

Those loyal <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> or the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses {{who did not know}} the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates the wheel <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The restoring {{force is applied}} in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing {{her head on his}} torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E
