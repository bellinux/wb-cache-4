5000|$|Controlled radical polymerization, namely {{reversible}} addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), is {{a common}} method for the polymerization of acrylates, methacrylates and acrylamides. Usually, a <b>thiocarbonate</b> is used in combination with an effective initiator for RAFT. The <b>thiocarbonate</b> moiety can be functionalized at the R-group for end group analysis. The end group {{is a result of}} the propagation of chain-transfer agents during the free-radical polymerization process. The end groups can subsequently be modified by the reaction of the thiocarbonylthio compounds with nucleophiles and ionic reducing agents. The method for removal of thiocarbonyl containing end groups includes reacting the polymers containing the end-groups with en excess of radicals which add to the reactive C=S bond of the end group forming an intermediate radical (shown below). The remaining radical on the polymer chain can be hydrogenated by what is referred to as a trapping group and terminate; this results in a polymer that is free of the end groups at the α and ω positions. Another method of end group removal for the thiocarbonyl containing end-groups of RAFT polymers is the addition of heat to the polymer; this is referred to as thermolysis. One method of monitoring thermolysis of RAFT polymers is by thermogravietric analysis resulting in a weight-loss of the end group. An advantage of this technique is that no additional chemicals are required to remove the end group; however, it is required that the polymer be thermally stable to high temperature and therefore may not be effective for some polymers. Depending on the polymers sensitivity to [...] ultraviolet radiation (UV) it has been reported in recent years that decomposition of end-groups can be effective, but preliminary data suggest that decomposition by UV leads to a change in the distribution of molecular weights of the polymer.|$|E

40|$|Stabilization traps toxic {{contaminants}} (usually both chemically and physically) in {{a matrix}} {{so that they}} do not leach into the environment. Typical contaminants are metals (mostly transition metals) that exhibit the characteristic of toxicity. The stabilization process routinely uses pozzolanic materials. Portland cement, fly ash-lime mixes, gypsum cements, and clays {{are some of the most}} common materials. In many instances, materials that can pass the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP-the federal leach test) or the Soluble Threshold Leachate Concentration (STLC-the California leach test) must have high concentrations of lime or other caustic material because of the low pH of the leaching media. Both leaching media, California`s and EPA`s, have a pH of 5. 0. California uses citric acid and sodium citrate while EPA uses acetic acid and sodium acetate. These media can form ligands that provide excellent metal leaching. Because of the aggressive nature of the leaching medium, stabilized wastes in many cases will not pass the leaching tests. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, additives such as dithiocarbamates and <b>thiocarbonates,</b> which are pH-insensitive and provide resistance to ligand formation, are used in the waste stabilization process.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work described in this thesis is {{an investigation into the}} reactivity and possible synthetic applications of aziridinylcarbinyl radicals. These radicals rapidly rearrange via βcleavage, which can proceed by breakage of either the CoN or C-C bond. Cleavage of the latter has been found when the molecule has a phenyl stabilising group attached to the aziridine ring. Chapter I is a review of the known radical reactions involving aziridines whilst chapter 2 discusses the various methods of aziridine syntheses. Chapter 3 outlines the project aims with reference to the potential of directed cleavage of aziridinylcarbinyl radicals in synthesis. Chapter 4, {{the main body of the}} work, describes the synthetic routes to aziridines derived from 3 -phenyl- 2 -cyclohexen-I-one and indenone. The radical mediated β-cleavage reactions of these is reported and the selectivity of C-C v. CoN bond homolysis has been investigated. Two successful approaches to the target aziridines were involved. I) Conversion of 3 -azido- 3 -phenylcyclohexan-I, 2 -diol, derived from the epoxide of 3 - phenyl- 2 -cyc 1 ohexen-I-ol, to the aziridine via reaction with triphenylphosphine. Subsequent methylation and formation of the thiocarbonylimidazolide gave the radical precursor Nmethyl- 5 -[imidazol-I-yl(thiocarbonyl) oxy]-I-phenyl- 7 -azabicylo[4. 1. 0]heptane. In the course of this work, several unusual cyclic <b>thiocarbonates</b> resulting from the reaction of 3 -azido- 3 - phenylcyclohexan-I, 2 -diol and 2 -azido- 3 -phenylcyclohexan-I, 3 -diol with I, I 'thiocarbonyl diimidazole were isolated. 2) Formation of N-(2 -ethylquinazolinonyl) -I-phenyl- 7 -azabicyclo[4. 1. 0]heptan- 5 - 01 from the reaction of 3 -amino- 2 -ethyl- 4 (3 H) -quinazolinone with 3 -phenyl- 2 -cyc 1 ohexen-I-ol in the presence of lead tetraacetate. These aziridines show interesting acid-catalysed rearrangements to diazadioxabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octanes. Formation of the thiocarbonylimidazolide then gave the radical precursor. A number of other aziridines have been prepared using this methodology. It has been found that in all cases the precursors undergo CoN bond homolysis under radical conditions. These results are discussed and conclusions are drawn. Suitable future work is also suggested...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the functional mechanism of thioxolone, a compound recently {{identified as a}} weak inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II by Iyer et al. (2006) J. Biomol. Screening 11, 782 - 791. Thioxolone lacks sulfonamide, sulfamate, or hydroxamate functional groups that are typically found in therapeutic carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, such as acetazolamide. Analytical chemistry and biochemical methods were used to investigate the fate of thioxolone upon binding to CA II, including Michaelis–Menten kinetics of 4 -nitrophenyl acetate esterase cleavage, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), oxygen- 18 isotope exchange studies, and X-ray crystallography. Thioxolone is proposed to be a prodrug inhibitor that is cleaved via a CA II zinc-hydroxide mechanism known to catalyze the hydrolysis of esters. When thioxolone binds in the active site of CA II, it is cleaved and forms 4 -mercaptobenzene- 1, 3 -diol via the intermediate S-(2, 4 -thiophenyl) hydrogen <b>thiocarbonate.</b> The esterase cleavage product binds to the zinc active site via the thiol group and is therefore the active CA inhibitor, while the intermediate {{is located at the}} rim of the active-site cavity. The time-dependence of this inhibition reaction was investigated in detail. Because this type of prodrug inhibitor mechanism depends on cleavage of ester bonds, this class of inhibitors may have advantages over sulfonamides in determining isozyme specificity.
