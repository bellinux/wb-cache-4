5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

2500|$|John Gay and Alexander Pope {{belong on}} one side of a line {{separating}} the celebrants of the individual and the celebrants of the social. [...] Pope wrote The Rape of the Lock, he said, to settle a disagreement between two great families, to laugh them into peace. [...] Even The Dunciad, which seems to be a serial killing of everyone on Pope's enemies list, sets up these figures as expressions of dangerous and antisocial forces in letters. [...] Theobald and Cibber are marked by vanity and pride, by having no care for morality. The hireling pens Pope attacks mercilessly in the heroic games section of the Dunciad are all embodiments of avarice and lies. [...] Similarly, Gay writes of political society, of social dangers, and of follies <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> to protect the greater whole. [...] Gay's individuals are microcosms of the society at large. [...] On {{the other side of this}} line were people who agreed with the politics of Gay and Pope (and Swift), but not in approach. They include, early in the Augustan Age, James Thomson and Edward Young.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} {{combined with}} local search were named "Memetic Algorithms" (MAs) in [1]. These methods {{are inspired by}} models of adaptation in natural systems that combine evolutionary adaptation of populations of individuals with individual learning within a lifetime. Additionally, MAs are inspired by Richard Dawkins concept of a meme, which represents a unit of cultural evolution that can exhibit local refinement[2]. In the case of MAs "memes" refer to the strategies (e. g. local refinement, perturbation or constructive methods, etc) individuals (also called "agents") employ to improve themselfs. In this paper we will review some works on the application of MAs to well known combinatorial optimization problems. A syntactic model will be defined and a classification scheme based on a computable index will be given. The existence of both a model and a taxonomy for MAs is of theoretical and practical relevance as it aids in conceptualizing important desing issues <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>address</b> if one intend to produce competent Memetic Algorithms.
