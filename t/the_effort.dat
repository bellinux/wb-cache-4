This research study is aimed at investigating <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> in <b>the</b> fulfillment of safety needs conducted by the students’ activity unit of full body contact sports in order to prevent accidents which can end in injury, physical defect, or even death during the training sessions. This is a descriptive research study involving the safety needs as the only variable. The population involved in this research was the students of Yogyakarta State University who were the members of the students’ activity unit in the area of full body contact sports.

Through this analysis, I found that <b>the</b> main character?s <b>efforts</b> and their effects are basically related with American dream concept. <b>The</b> <b>efforts</b> may occur in everyone?s life. The wealth will mean nothing although it is already achieved if we also lose something important in our life.
