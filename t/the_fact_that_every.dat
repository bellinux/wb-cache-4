The function that maps each configuration to its successor is, mathematically, a surjective function. Rule 90 is also not injective. In an injective rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective. The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective, but this example shows that the converse is not true.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem lies in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Porcupine in 1983, NME {{reviewer}} Barney Hoskyns gave the album a negative review. Hoskyns wrote, [...] "Porcupine is the distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points, a dynamic force striving fruitlessly to escape the brilliant track that trails behind it." [...] Hoskyns likened {{the sound of the}} album to the band [...] "turning on their own greatest 'hits' and savaging them". Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch's lyrics and the general mood of the album, noting, [...] "Only on 'Porcupine' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce", and dismissed the entire second side of the album, saying it [...] "horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration, for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention". Record reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs, such as Ian McCullough's octave jumps, from their previous albums. While he praised the opening tracks [...] "The Cutter" [...] and [...] "Back of Love", he remarked that Porcupine as a whole was not nearly as good an album as Echo and the Bunnymen's live performances showed they were capable of.|$|E

[...] With tremendous self-created pressure, he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound, incorporating elements of math-rock, indie-pop and theatrical pomp. He and Linder also started the search for a producer. The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O'Heir and Stephen Trask. Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on [...] "the artistic struggle, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art, to be more than just a guy in a band or a poet or a sculptor." [...] Bemis originally intended the album to be a rock opera with a full script, narration, and a cast of characters. It was tentatively titled Zona! Zona! However, Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> once in a while I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
500|$|While {{there are}} not many {{accounts}} of early courts in Alder Gulch, probably due to their informality and short existence, John X. Beidler recalled a murder trial in the Virginia City miners' court in his memoirs. The trial recalled by Beidler occurred in the fall of 1863. It concerned the matter of the murder of J.W. Dillingham. [...] The trial was held outside, due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> resident took part. In the end all three defendants were set free. The first, Charley Forbes, was freed after he gave an eloquent and sentimental speech about his mother. [...] The other two, Buck Stinson and Haze Lyons, were convicted and set to be the first men executed in what would become the state of Montana. [...] However, at what would be a very public hanging friends and sympathizers of Stinson and Lyons convinced the crowd to vote again on the execution. [...] Two attempts at counting the vote were made according to Beidler. The first people voting 'hang' were to walk up-hill while those voting 'no hang' were to walk down-hill. [...] This vote was rejected and the next attempt had four men form two gates and people would cast their vote by walking through the 'hang' gate or the 'no hang' gate. [...] Beidler claims that friends of the condemned men simply walked through the 'no hang' gate multiple times casting multiple fraudulent votes that possibly allowed two murderers to walk free.|$|E
