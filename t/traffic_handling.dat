This basic battery layout could attack three warheads at once, normally using two missiles per salvo in case one failed in flight.

A maximally expanded battery included three DRs, ten TTRs, six TICs driving eighteen MTRs and 72 missiles.

5|$|In 1968, {{the freeway}} was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed {{for a year and}} a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and <b>traffic</b> <b>handling</b> as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor John Engler.|$|E
