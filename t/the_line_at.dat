5|$|Passenger numbers fell {{during the}} 1960s, {{and the line}} became {{economically}} unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but no trace remains of the stations.|$|E
5|$|South of the 36th Street {{station on}} the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, there are three trackways that diverge from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> a flying junction. These trackways end under the eastern curb of Fourth Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The railway left <b>the</b> Cuckoo <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> Hellingly Station. Although {{the railway}} joined <b>the</b> Cuckoo <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> {{northern}} and southern ends of the platform, virtually no through trains ran. Due to the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> junction with <b>the</b> Cuckoo <b>Line,</b> passenger trains {{to and from the}} hospital reversed south of Hellingly station.|$|R
5|$|The Trans-Siberian Railway and {{its various}} {{associated}} branches and supporting lines, completed in 1916, established the first rail connection between Europe and Asia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. <b>The</b> <b>line,</b> <b>at</b> , {{is the longest}} rail line in the world.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{approved}} {{and the bill}} received royal assent on 28 March 1893 as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1893. Stations were permitted at Baker Street, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Embankment and Waterloo. The depot {{would have been at}} the south end of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> James Street and Lower Marsh.|$|E
5|$|All three {{captured}} {{ships were}} taken into the Royal Navy. The name of Alexandre reverted to the former Alexander, and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by Alexanders presence in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball. Tigre retained her French name, while Formidable, as there was already a ship of that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS Belleisle, apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. Belleisle had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.|$|E

5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} the rails before smashing into a building. The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the end of the 1965 holiday season. Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{disputes}} and delays, {{it was reported}} in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked TIE to draw up costs for truncating <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.|$|E
5|$|From November 1943, {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan {{to fight a}} costly war of attrition, while {{awaiting}} Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.|$|E

5|$|In a dark match {{before the}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, {{and that the}} belts would not be on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits {{trying to solve the}} mystery of the two Undertakers.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine {{reached the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As there was not enough track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1998, Hatfield Government Station opened {{along with}} the Westside MAX line. Dedication ceremonies for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the station {{included}} a speech by then U.S. Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater. Oregon politicians speaking at the dedication included Governor John Kitzhaber, former Congressman Les AuCoin, then Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse, U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Gordon Smith, and former Senator and station namesake Mark Hatfield. Scheduled train service began at 11:00a.m., which {{was followed by a}} two-day opening party.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Hwanghae Chŏngnyŏn <b>Line</b> is an {{electrified}} standard-gauge secondary <b>line</b> of <b>the</b> Korean State Railway in the North and South Hwanghae {{provinces of}} North Korea, running from Sariwŏn to Haeju.

It {{plays an important}} role in the transportation of freight and passengers in North and South Hwanghae provinces, serving important mining and industrial areas, as well as one of the DPRKs most important ports for foreign trade.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station were {{electrified}} on 9 January 1965. On 15 January 1967, all <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> {{were converted}} to 25 kV AC.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> {{connects with}} <b>the</b> Yamada <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> Ujiyamada Station and <b>the</b> Shima <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> Toba Station. <b>The</b> Yamada <b>Line,</b> Toba Line, and Shima Line form a single train <b>line</b> that begins <b>at</b> Ise-Nakagawa Station and serves the Ise-Shima tourist region.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the start, McLaren {{confirmed}} {{that they were}} unable to get Jenson Button's car to the grid, as the data indicated his earlier electrical issues continued. Felipe Massa's Williams did not get off <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the start of the formation lap, so he had to start from pit lane. The start lights went on after a long delay, due to Pastor Maldonado being in the wrong grid position.|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{had spent most of}} their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E
5|$|Several of the area's coastal {{settlements}} have {{facilities for}} small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service {{runs to the}} Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins River Branch, linked the area with the South Island Main Trunk Line from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, {{but it did not}} reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.|$|E

5|$|The French Atlantic fleet {{was even}} more {{dispersed}} than the British {{in the spring of}} 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and Briarwood, normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The M and R serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and the R splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> all times, while the M runs on the line during weekdays only and the R runs on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of Briarwood to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based train control system, would add capacity to the line.|$|E
5|$|The Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} at Harding Avenue in the Bronx, {{and connect}} into the Court Street station in Brooklyn as a two-track and four-track line. A yard {{would have been}} constructed to store the line's equipment. The first phase would end <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> East 139th Street. The Main Line and its connections to other subway lines was to have cost $213,950,000, while the future Bronx extension would have cost $130,160,000.|$|E
