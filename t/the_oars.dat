5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> of an outrigger skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very similar {{to one of the}} other types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all <b>the</b> <b>oars.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>oar</b> {{acts as a}} lever, {{pivoting}} {{around the}} gate, which acts as a fulcrum. <b>The</b> <b>oar's</b> button sets <b>the</b> leverage ratio between the inboard and outboard portions of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> and therefore sets the gearing.|$|R
25|$|The rower pushes <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> handle down so <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade {{comes out}} of the water.|$|R
40|$|Regardless of <b>the</b> angle <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> {{makes to}} <b>the</b> forward {{direction}} during a rowing stroke, there is negligible loss of energy between <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> and <b>the</b> gate. However, {{it does not}} follow from this that there is no decrease in <b>oar</b> efficiency at <b>the</b> extreme <b>oar</b> angles necessary for a very long catch. The loss of energy from <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> occurs, not at the gate, but at the blade. The water which is moved by the blade absorbs mechanical energy from <b>the</b> <b>oar.</b> Calculations, experimental data and on-water measurements of rowing show that the energy efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> is generally lowest for oar angles less than 55 degrees to the boat-forward direction (i. e. {{in the early part of}} the stroke) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{disposition}} {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf lashed his ships side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows projected beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all hands free to fight, that a barrier could be formed with <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another advantage to the defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would have to shoot upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt {{was shocked by the}} dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.|$|E
50|$|A {{thixotropic}} fluid is best visualised by an oar blade {{embedded in}} mud. Pressure on <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> {{often results in}} a highly viscous (more solid) thixotropic mud on the high pressure side of the blade, and low viscosity (very fluid) thixotropic mud on the low pressure side of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade. Flow from the high pressure side to the low pressure side of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade is non-Newtonian. (i.e.: fluid velocity is not linearly proportional to the square root of the pressure differential over <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade).|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the stroke, {{with the}} blade still in the water, the hands drop {{slightly}} to unload <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> so that spring energy stored in the bend of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> gets transferred to the boat, which eases removing <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> from <b>the</b> water and minimizes energy wasted on lifting water above the surface (splashing).|$|R
50|$|Oarlocks are {{technical}} {{pieces of}} equipment in sport rowing, holding <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> shaft and therefore <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade at <b>the</b> correct angle in the water to ensure optimum performance.|$|R
25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} image of rowers chained to <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> {{conveyed}} by movies such as Ben Hur, {{there is no evidence}} that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals or slaves as oarsmen, with the possible exception of Ptolemaic Egypt. Literary evidence indicates that Greek and Roman navies relied on paid labor or ordinary soldiers to man their galleys. Slaves were put at <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> only in times of extreme crisis. In some cases, these people were given freedom thereafter, while in others they began their service aboard as free men. Roman merchant vessels (usually sailing vessels) were manned by slaves, sometimes even with slaves as ship's master, but this was seldom the case in merchant galleys.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>oars</b> {{include a}} {{traditional}} Chinese sculling oar called a yuloh, used from the stern, {{and a pair}} of oars that can be used from the bow. These oars allow the crews of shrimp fishing junks to maneuver around the fixed nets when the wind is not blowing.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{among the}} {{occupants}} of Boat 6 were strained throughout the night. Hichens apparently resented Peuchen's presence, perhaps fearing the major would pull rank and take charge. The two men quarreled, and Hichens refused Peuchen's request that he assist him at <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> since {{there was only one}} other man (Fleet) rowing.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese [...] "yuloh" [...] (from [...] ) is a large, heavy {{sculling}} oar with {{a socket}} {{on the underside}} of its shaft which fits over a stern-mounted pin, creating a pivot which allows <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> to swivel and rock from side to side. The weight of <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> often supplemented by a rope lashing, holds <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> in place on the pivot. The weight of the outboard portion of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> is counterbalanced by a rope running from the underside of the handle to the deck of the boat. The sculler mainly moves <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> by pushing and pulling on this rope, which causes <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> to rock on its pivot, automatically angling the blade to create forward thrust. This system allows multiple rowers to operate one oar, allowing large, heavy boats to be rowed if necessary. The efficiency of this system gave rise to the Chinese saying [...] "a scull equals three oars".|$|R
25|$|The two {{fundamental}} reference {{points in the}} anatomy of a rowing stroke are the catch where <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the extraction (also known as the 'finish', 'release' or 'tapping down') where <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade is removed from the water. After the blade is placed in the water at the catch, the rower applies pressure to <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> levering <b>the</b> boat forward which is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the rower extracts <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> from <b>the</b> water, the recovery phase begins, setting up the rower's body for the next stroke.|$|R
25|$|Just as <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> blade {{is being}} {{removed from the}} water, the rower rotates <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> handle 90 degrees so that the blade is again {{parallel}} to the water. This action {{is referred to as}} feathering.|$|R
25|$|Served {{on board}} the U.S.S. Wyandank during a boat {{expedition}} up Mattox Creek, March 17, 1865. Participating with a boat crew in the clearing of Mattox Creek, L/man Anderson carried out his duties courageously {{in the face of}} a devastating fire which cut away half <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> pierced the launch in many places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy.|$|E
25|$|One legend {{says that}} the {{building}} rests on immense piles of oak sinking into the waters of an underground lake. A boat would roam around the lake, without anyone inside, though the noise of <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> could be heard nevertheless. According to the legend, the entry to the underground lake {{could be found in}} the cellar of a house just opposite the cathedral. It would have been walled up a few centuries ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ship}} Adventure Galley was {{well suited to}} the task of {{catching}} pirates, weighing over 284 tons burthen and equipped with 34 cannon, oars, and 150 men. <b>The</b> <b>oars</b> were a key advantage, as they enabled Adventure Galley to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.|$|E
50|$|In single-oar sculling, <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> pivots on <b>the</b> boat's stern, and the inboard end {{is pushed}} {{to one side}} with the blade turned so that it generates forward thrust; it is then twisted so that when pulled back on the return stroke, the blade also {{produces}} forward thrust. Backward thrust can also be generated by twisting <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> in <b>the</b> other direction and rowing. Steering, as in moving coxless sculling shells in crew, is accomplished by directing <b>the</b> thrust. <b>The</b> <b>oar</b> normally pivots in a simple notch cut into—or rowlock mounted on— {{the stern of the}} boat, and the sculler must angle the blade, by twisting the inboard end of <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> to generate <b>the</b> thrust that not only pushes the boat forward but also holds <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> in its pivot. Specifically, the operation of <b>the</b> single sculling (<b>oar)</b> is unique as turning the blade of <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> in figure 8 motions operates them. It is not hoisted {{in and out of the}} water like any other traditional <b>oars.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to minimize the movement of the operator’s hands, and the side-to-side movement of the boat, so the boat moves through the water slowly and steadily. This minimal rotation keeps the water moving over the top of the blade and results in forces that transfer to the multi directional row-lock, or pivoting mount, on the side of the hull thus pushing the boat forward. Steering the boat is just a matter of rotating <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> to produce more thrust on a push or pull of <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> depending upon which way the operator wants to go.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE:Hypofractionated {{irradiation}} {{is often}} used in precise radiotherapy instead of conventional multifractionated irradiation. We propose a novel mathematical method for selecting a hypofractionated or multifractionated irradiation regimen based on physical dose distribution adding to biologic consideration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The linear-quadratic model {{was used for the}} radiation effects on tumor and normal tissues, especially organs at risk (<b>OARs).</b> On <b>the</b> basis of the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> receives a fraction of the dose intended for the tumor, the minimization problem for the damage effect on <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> was treated under the constraint that the radiation effect on the tumor is fixed. RESULTS: For an N-time fractionated irradiation regimen, the constraint of tumor lethality was described by an N-dimensional hypersphere. The total dose of the fractionated irradiations was considered for minimizing the damage effect on <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> under <b>the</b> hypersphere condition. It was found that the advantage of hypofractionated or multifractionated irradiation therapies depends on the magnitude of the ratio of α/β parameters for <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> and tumor in the linear-quadratic model and the ratio of the dose for <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> and tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Our mathematical method shows that multifractionated irradiation with a constant dose is better if the ratio of α/β for <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> and tumor is less than the ratio of the dose for <b>the</b> <b>OAR</b> and tumor, whereas hypofractionated irradiation is better otherwise...|$|R
25|$|The rower {{extends the}} arms fully forward (toward the stern) pushing <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> {{away from his}} or her body while, at the same time, keeping <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> at a {{constant}} height with his or her legs straight, and torso leaning back.|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} watch before dawn, they {{attacked}} {{the guards and}} the sleeping Spaniards, killing most of them, although a few escaped by swimming or in the galley's tender. Upon hearing the commotion, Governor Dasmariñas, thinking that the galley was dragging and the men were taking to <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> carelessly left his cabin bareheaded. He was killed by several Chinese waiting outside the door. Two Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Franciscan Father Montilla, survived by remaining in their cabin amidships. They were later released ashore by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus {{was once}} {{captured}} by Etruscan pirates who mistook {{him for a}} wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins {{so that they would}} spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{was subject}} to a similar attack. In June 1631 Murat Reis, with corsairs from Algiers and armed troops of the Ottoman Empire, stormed ashore at the little harbor village of Baltimore, County Cork. They {{captured}} almost all the villagers and took them away {{to a life of}} slavery in North Africa. The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates— some lived out their days chained to <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> as galley slaves, while women spent long years as concubines in harems or within the walls of the sultan's palace. Only two of these captives ever returned to Ireland.|$|E
60|$|Without a cry, Bill's {{grasp on}} <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> loosened; he fell over it limply, his head {{striking}} the almost submerged log. A dark-red fluid colored the water; then his body slipped over <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> and into <b>the</b> river, where it sank.|$|R
50|$|Since 2009, <b>the</b> Okefenokee <b>Oar</b> {{has been}} awarded to {{the winner of the}} Florida-Georgia game. Florida last {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> for its 2016 victory.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> can be {{conveniently}} {{thought of}} as a lever with a [...] "fixed" [...] pivot point in the water, the blade moves sideways and sternwards through the water, so that the magnitude of the propulsion force developed {{is the result of a}} complex interaction between unsteady fluid mechanics (the water flow around the blade) and solid mechanics and dynamics (the handle force applied to <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar's</b> inertia and bending characteristic, the acceleration of the boat and so on).|$|R
25|$|An 1899 {{reproduction}} of the Lincoln Imp also overlooked the Front Quad of Lincoln College, Oxford until 2000 when it {{was transferred to the}} bar (Deep Hall) and another Imp was erected in the traditional position above the entrance to Hall. This has given rise to a traditional Oxford expression: 'to look on someone like the Imp looks over Lincoln' as well as giving rise to the title of the college's undergraduate newspaper: The Lincoln Imp. The Lincoln Imp is also the mascot of the college boat club, an image of which is used to decorate <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> and jerseys of the men's 1st VIII.|$|E
25|$|The Barbary corsairs had {{a direct}} Christian {{counterpart}} in the military order of the Knights of Saint John that operated out first out of Rhodes and after 1530 Malta), though they were less numerous and took fewer slaves. Both sides waged war against the respective enemies of their faith, and both used galleys as their primary weapons. Both sides also used captured or bought galley slaves to man <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> of their ships; the Muslims relying mostly on captured Christians, the Christians using a mix of Muslim slaves, Christian convicts and a small contingency of buonavoglie, free men who out of desperation or poverty had taken to rowing.|$|E
25|$|Before engines became available, boats {{could be}} {{propelled}} manually {{or by the}} wind. Boats could be propelled by the wind by attaching sails to masts set upright in the boat. Manual propulsion {{could be done in}} shallow water by punting with a push pole, and in deeper water by paddling with a paddle or rowing with oars. The difference between paddling and rowing is that when rowing <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> have a mechanical connection with the boat, while when paddling the paddles are hand-held with no mechanical connection. Canoes were traditionally paddled, with the paddler facing the bow of the boat. Small boats that use oars are called rowboats, and the rower typically faces the stern.|$|E
5000|$|In {{sculling}} each rower has two oars (or sculls), {{one in each}} hand. Sculling {{is usually}} done without a coxswain, in quads, doubles or singles. <b>The</b> <b>oar</b> in <b>the</b> sculler's right hand extends to port, and <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> in <b>the</b> left hand extends to starboard.|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side of the boat, she made a grasp at <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> but it was too far for her to reach it; and then, by a spasmodic {{movement}} of <b>the</b> other <b>oar,</b> <b>the</b> distance was increased.|$|R
5000|$|Oars have {{traditionally}} been made of wood. The form is a long shaft (or loom) with a flat blade on the end. Where <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> connects to <b>the</b> boat there is a [...] "collar" [...] which stops <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> slipping past <b>the</b> rowlock. <b>Oars</b> usually have a handle about 150mm long, which may be a material sleeve or alternatively an ovoid shape carved to fit the hands.|$|R
