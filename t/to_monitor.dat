This imaging has allowed scientists <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
40|$|Boards of directors’ {{attention}} <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{represents an}} understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, {{we find that}} board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention <b>to</b> their <b>monitoring</b> function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards’ attention <b>to</b> <b>monitoring,</b> positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards’ allocation of attention <b>to</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Additional analysis demonstrates {{that the effects of}} duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair’s control of the meeting’s agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards’ attention <b>to</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members’ monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders’ interests...|$|R
