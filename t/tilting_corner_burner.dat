Recently with a growing population and vast growing urbanization some buildings have started to experience structural damages, which {{are not related to}} their construction design, but rather to the ground conditions around the buildings’ foundations. Variations in properties of the soil supporting the buildings’ foundations such as soil bearing capacity, moisture content and scouring may eventually lead to the failure of these buildings. This study is attempting to characterize the variations in the soil properties around the City Star shopping mall, in eastern Cairo, where a large building has tilted over the past few years. This tilting may lead to the collapse of the whole building if it continues at the same rate. An integrated geophysical investigation including multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW), ground penetrating radar (GPR) and 2 -D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used around the affected building to help detect possible causes of deterioration. The GPR data showed a soil-fill layer overlaying a thick bottom layer of higher moisture content. The MASW data revealed a middle layer of relatively low shear wave velocity sandwiched between two relatively high shear wave velocity layers. The ERT data showed an upper low resistivity layer overlying a high resistivity layer. Integrating the interpretations of the three geophysical methods provide a combined model that reflects lateral and vertical variation in the soil properties.

Automated tilt control systems can be classed as Steering Tilt Control (STC) in which active control of the front wheel steer angle is used to maintain stability, Direct Tilt Control (DTC) in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and a non-tilting base, or {{a combination of the two}} (SDTC).

It is also shown that by using a revised series of steer inputs, a vehicle equipped with SDTC is able to successfully follow a similar path to one equipped with DTC, and that the roll stability of the vehicle is not unduly compromised.

Their narrow width requires that they <b>tilt</b> into <b>corners</b> {{in order to maintain}} stability; this may be achieved by means of an automated tilt control system. A three-wheeled tilting vehicle prototype, known as the Compact Low Emission Vehicle for uRban transport (CLEVER), was constructed at the University of Bath in 2006. The vehicle was equipped with a direct tilt control system in which a pair of hydraulic actuators applied a moment between the cabin and a non-tilting base. This tilt control system provided satisfactory steady state performance but limited transient stability. High tilt rate demands associated with rapid steering inputs would lead to large tilting moments being applied to the non-tilting rear engine module; this, combined with the engine module’s own propensity to roll out of the bend, could cause the inside wheel to lift and the vehicle to capsize. This thesis details the implementation of a Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) system, whereby the front wheel steer angle is used to generate some of the tilting moment, on the prototype CLEVER Vehicle. Simulation and experimental results are presented which show a 40 % reduction in load transfer across the rear axle during a transient ramp steer manoeuvre. The influence of the SDTC system, and associated steer angle alteration, on the vehicle trajectory is considered. A human driver is found to be capable of adapting their steer inputs such that they can follow their chosen path. Finally, a feed-forward control strategy is shown to reduce the load transfer across the rear axle by an additional 30 % in transient situations, but only if the steer input signal is sufficiently free of noise...|$|R
40|$|The major {{advantage}} of a motorcycle {{with respect to a}} passenger car is the possibility of the driver to <b>tilt</b> during <b>cornering</b> and thereby maintaining stability whereas a passenger car will suffer from the risk of capsizing at high speed. This observation has motivated recently various manufacturers to develop new concepts of narrow vehicles that are able to tilt like a motorcycle but offer the comfort of a passenger car, allowing further downsizing of vehicles enabling higher fuel efficiency. As a result, there seems to arise a whole new class of vehicles, which cannot be compared, to either passenger cars or motorcycles, with typical examples such as the Ford Gyron and the GM Lean Machine. More recent examples are the Daimler Benz Life Jet and the Carver of Brink Dynamics. This paper includes a mathematical treatment of the dynamic behaviour of such vehicles, denoted here as a Narrow Tilting Vehicle (NTV). The analysis is based on a vehicle concept consisting of three main rigid bodies, a front assembly (front fork), a mid-assembly (passenger cabin) and a two-wheeled rear-assembly (engine, rear part of chassis including rear suspension, wheels, etc.). Important criteria for the designer are a stable behaviour and, on the other hand, a smooth, responsive cornering performance. As it turns out, various eigenmodes related to yaw, steering and roll behaviour of the vehicle are working against each other in this respect. Obviously, many vehicle design parameters play an important role where which {{have a major impact on}} the vehicle behaviour. One might distinguish the overall dimensions, mass distribution, front-fork geometry, tyre characteristics, suspension layout, the tilting controller design, etc. Due to the large variety in parameter-combinations, sensitivity regarding one single parameter always depends on the selected reference case for the remaining parameters, and therefore cannot be extrapolated easily to reach its optimal value. In the paper, the design parameters having a major impact on the vehicle performance are identified. The impact of parameter modifications on the vehicle stability and handling performance is discussed on the basis of mathematical analysis, and interpreted in physical terms (supported by numerical analysis and experimental results). That means that, finally, tendencies in changes in vehicle performance can be and resulting in general guidelines for the design of this new class of vehicle...|$|R

Calza, who applied the aerial survey in 1940 s to create the first general map of Ostia, may draw the map by the simple way in which the street line may perhaps be traced from an aerial photograph. Consequentially his map includes considerable divergence. However the Decumanus Maximus in Calza's map was almost exact to the distance with a possible error 3 m (This is less than 0. 1 % errors).

40|$|As part of {{the natural}} {{evolution}} and continued optimisation of their designs, current and future magnetic recording heads, used and proposed in technologies such as perpendicular recording, shingled magnetic recording and two-dimensional magnetic recording, often exhibit asymmetry in their structure. They consist of two semi-infinite poles separated by a gap (where the recording field is produced), with an inner gap faces inclined at an angle. Modelling of the fields from asymmetrical structures is complex, and no explicit solutions are currently available (only implicit conformal mapping solutions are available for rational inclination angles). Moreover, there is limited understanding on the correlation between the gap corner angle and the magnitude, distribution and wavelength response of these head structures. This research was therefore set out to investigate approximate analytical and semi-analytical methods for modelling the magnetic potentials and fields of two-dimensional symmetrical and asymmetrical magnetic recording heads, and deliver a quantitative understanding of the behaviour of the potentials and fields as functions of gap corner angles. The accuracy of the derived expressions (written in terms of the normalised root-mean-square deviation) was assessed by comparison to exact available solutions for limited cases, and to finite-element calculations on Comsol Multiphysics. Two analytical methods were derived to approximately model the fields from two-dimensional heads with <b>tilted</b> gap <b>corners</b> in the presence and absence of a soft magnetic underlayer (SUL) : in the first method, the potential near a single, two-dimensional corner held at a constant potential is derived exactly through solution of Laplace's equation for the scalar potential in polar coordinates. Then through appropriate choice of enclosing boundary conditions, the potentials and fields of two corners at equal and opposite potentials and displaced from each other by a distance equal to the gap length were superposed to map the potential and field for asymmetrical and symmetrical heads. For asymmetrical heads, the superposition approximation provided good agreement to finite-element calculations for the limited range of exterior corner angles  0 from 0  (right-angled corner) to 45 , due to the mismatch of surface charge densities on both poles for this geometry. For symmetrical head structures, the superposition approximation was found to yield remarkable agreement to exact solutions for all gap corner orientations from 0  (right-angled head) to 90  ("thin" gap head). In the second method derived in this research for modelling asymmetrical heads involved using a rational function approximation with free parameters to model the surface potential of asymmetrical heads. The free parameters and their functional dependence on corner angle were determined through fitting to finite-element calculations, enabling the derivation of analytical expressions for the magnetic fields that are in good agreement with exact solutions for all corner angels (0  to 90 ). To complement the two approximate methods for modelling the fields from asymmetrical and symmetrical heads, a new general approach based on the sine integral transform was derived to model the reaction of soft underlayers on the surface potential or field of any two-dimensional head structure, for sufficiently close head-to-underlayer separations. This method produces an infinite series of correction terms whose coefficients are functions of the head-to-underlayer separation and gap corner angle, that are added to the surface potential or field {{in the absence of an}} underlayer. This new approach demonstrated good agreement with finite-element calculations for sufficiently close head-to-underlayer separations, and with the classical Green's functions solutions for increasing separations. Using the derived analytical method and explicit expressions in this work, an understanding of the nature of the magnetic fields and their spectra as functions of the gap corner angles is gained. This understanding and analytical theory will benefit the modelling, design and optimisation of high performance magnetic recording heads.
