40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. For {{many years}} the Savannah River has {{suffered}} fish consumption warnings. While several {{potential sources of}} mercury may contribute to this contamination, the chlor-alkali facility in Augusta, which produces chlorine by electrolysis using mercury-cell technology, is a major potential contributor. To examine this possibility samples of sediment were collected from the river {{above and below the}} facility and from the channel leading to the river from the facility. Sediment mercury concentrations and sediment toxicities to amphipods were measured. Mean sediment mercury concentrations in the chlor-alkali discharge channel 62, 708 +/- 62, 216 ppb dry weight. Upstream and downstream of the chlor-alkali facility channel mean mercury concentrations of dried sediments were 24. 4 +/- 14. 7 and 46. 6 +/- 51. 2 ppb, respectively. Channel sediments and downstream river sediments were significantly toxic to amphipods as compared with river sediment samples upstream. Tissue levels of mercury in half of 34 catfish caught within 20 miles downstream of the chlor-alkali facility and 60 % of the 32 bass caught in the same region of the river exceeded the 0. 3 ppm that <b>trigger</b> a <b>fish</b> consumption warning. It is apparent that the extremely high mercury levels in the sediment of the outfall channel of the chlor-alkali plant contribute to the mercury problems in the river.

40|$|The {{long-fingered bat}} Myotis capaccinii is a European {{trawling}} bat reported {{to feed on}} fish in several Mediterranean locations, but the ecological circumstances of this behavior {{have not yet been}} studied. To elucidate the importance of fishing in this bat’s diet, we evaluated the frequency and seasonal variation of fish remains in 3, 000 fecal pellets collected from M. capaccinii at a nursery roost in Dénia (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Fish consumption occurred evenly throughout the year. All otoliths found in feces were identified as belonging to the surface-feeding fish Gambusia holbrooki. Measuring otoliths, we estimated that the mean size of consumed fish was significantly smaller than the mean measured for available fish, suggesting that the long-fingered bat’s relatively small body may constrain its handling of larger prey. Of note, one bat had eaten 15 fish, showing that fish may be a locally or seasonally important trophic resource for this species. By capturing 15 bats and radio-tracking the four with the most fish remains in their droppings, we also identified fishing areas, including a single fishing ground comprising several ponds within a golf course. Ponds hold a high density of G. holbrooki, suggesting that the amount of fish at the water surface may be the principal factor <b>triggering</b> <b>fishing.</b> The observed six-fold increase in percentage of consumed fish across the study period may be related to recent pond-building in the area.

Eight years of data from eight rocky subtidal reefs known to support giant kelp forests near Santa Barbara, CA, USA, were analyzed in three-tiered least-squares regression models to evaluate the relationships between: (1) lobster abundance and sea urchin density, and (2) sea urchin density and macroalgal biomass.

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{significant}} revenue {{involved in}} marine aquarium trade notwithstanding, {{in developing countries}} generates gainful employment and alternate livelihood in rural sector to fishers. Despite rich biodiversity of marine ornamental fishes and ideal milieu for expansion of trade the sector remains at infancy. However, absence of primary database on marketing is a major handicap in expansion and regulation of this sector. This study focused on status of demand, supply and potentials of marine aquarium fish trade. The study covered demand and supply entities including suppliers, hobbyists and aquarium keepers. The results documents prominence of aquarium industry and portray the challenges in expanding domestic trade in Kerala. The preferred candidates in trade in Kerala include damsel fish, wrasse, butterfly fish, <b>trigger</b> <b>fish</b> and cardinal fishes. Hobbyist‚ awareness, interests and willingness to keep marine fishes was high despite negligible trade. The demand and purchasing power of hobbyists is undoubtedly {{the single most important}} force in determining potential and profitability of marine aquarium industry in Kerala. Maintenance and upkeep snags, technological lag, institutional support and high mortality were the major problems in the sector. The resources are currently being unexploited or discarded. The sector could provide alternative avocation for fishermen if state of art technologies for collection, handling and transport are developed integrating with conservation and sustainable development objectives. The marine aquarium trade of Kerala needs to capitalize on key strength of unexploited resources by alleviating major weaknesses of technological lag and harnessing the opportunities of tapping the huge demand for improving trade...|$|E
40|$|Trophic cascades <b>triggered</b> by <b>fishing</b> have {{profound}} implications for marine ecosystems and the socioeconomic systems {{that depend on}} them. With the number of reported cases quickly growing, key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery-induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore, their magnitude appears to be context dependent, varying {{as a function of}} species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity, {{and the nature of the}} fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems, there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances, identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation, determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades, pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts, and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery-induced trophic cascades. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Pescadero Lagoon is {{a complex}} lagoon system located on the central California coast in San Mateo County. Over the last decade, {{external}} stressors such as degraded water quality, restricted circulation, heightened groundwater withdrawals, changes in the fluvial geomorphology that affect surface water runoff, and widespread agriculture in the watershed have impacted the lagoon.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{offshore}} wind farms (OWF) is increasing {{to meet the}} demands for renewable energy. The piles and hard substrate surrounding these piles creates new habitat for species with preference to hard substrates. We studied the impact of this hard substrate on the fish community in a Dutch OWF in the sandy southern North Sea, which had been in operation for five years. Multi-mesh gillnets were placed near the OWF structures on the hard substrate protection revetments and on the sandy bottom {{in the middle of the}} farm. The catches indicated attraction of cod, pouting, bullrout and edible and velvet crab, while attraction to the sandy habitat was shown for flatfish and whiting. Further, two species previously not caught in this area, goldsinny wrasse and grey <b>trigger</b> <b>fish,</b> were caught on the hard substrate. In addition a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to record transects through the farm to observe individual fish in the water column throughout the farm and very near the OWF structures. High abundances of fish near the structure were observed during some days, while during other days equal distribution of fish in the area was observed. The area around the structures is thus only used temporarily for shelter or feeding. The DIDSON also allowed looking at the aggregation level of the fish. Seasonally the aggregation level differed most likely due to different species occurring in the area. In April, most fish were aggregated in schools, while in summer most observations were individual fish or loose aggregations. The wind farm structures had limited effect on the aggregation level compared to season or weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{aspects of the}} ecology of fishes and mosquitoes using floodplains in the lower reaches of the Gambia River, a semi-arid river system. The Gambia River, situated {{at the edge of}} the Sahel, represents one of the few remaining major river systems not to have been impacted by any impoundments. It was hypothesised that seasonal variations in physical variables particularly related to the pattern of flooding and drying influence fish species distribution; the presence of some of these species probably also influencing mosquito larvae distribution. Fish and mosquito larvae were sampled along two lateral transects on the floodplain in The Gambia, from May to November 2005 - 2007. Water conductivity, pH and water depth all influenced fish species richness and bolongs (creeks) held greater species richness compared with other floodplain habitats, probably because they acted as conduits for fish moving on and off the floodplain. Species richness and catch biomass increased rapidly following the first rains and then declined. The Guinean tilapia, Tilapia guineensis, was the dominant species on the floodplains and its catches were positively associated with higher levels of conductivity and dissolved oxygen, shallower water and less vegetation cover. The Guinean tilapia is primarily an iliophage and the catches varied seasonally. Controlled experiments using T. guineensis in tanks with shallow water barriers showed that fish density plays a significant role in <b>triggering</b> <b>fish</b> emigration, whereas a lack of food available caused an increase in exploratory behaviour but with no impact on successful emigration. The influence of fish on the distribution of mosquito larvae on the floodplains was investigated. Semi-field trials were used to test two possible mechanisms for this influence: direct predation and oviposition avoidance due to the presence of fish chemical cues. The presence of T. guineensis decreased the chance of finding culicine larvae in the field possibly due to culicine mosquito avoiding ovipositing in habitats with fish present as fewer culicines oviposited in experimental tanks with fish, suggesting that ovipositing culicine females avoid water with fish. In contrast, oviposition by anophelines was unaffected by fish. Both fish species tested, T. guineensis and a common insectivore, Epiplatys spilargyreius were effective predators removing all late-stage culicine and anopheline larvae. In order to determine the relationships between mosquito distribution and the physical environment in an urban setting, mosquitoes were collected and environmental physical parameters were measured in and around Farafenni town, located {{at the edge of the}} foodplains in The Gambia. Levels of reactive phosphorus, distance from the nearest house, turbidity, amount of vegetation cover and the presence of algae all influenced the occurence of mosquito larvae collected in and around Farafeimi town. Anopheles arabiensis was found closer to houses than Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and the presence of algae was a strong indicator of the presence of anopheline larvae in general. Sites dominated by anophelines had higher turbidity levels compared to sites in which culicines dominated. Production of pupae was associated with high levels of reactive phosphorus concentrations. The results are discussed in the context of world climate change, anthropogenic impacts on large rivers and increased urbanisation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Fishing has clear {{direct effects}} on {{harvested}} species, but its cascading, indirect effects are less well understood. Fishing disproportionately removes larger, predatory fishes from marine food webs. Most {{studies of the}} consequent indirect effects focus on density-mediated interactions where predator removal alternately drives increases and decreases in abundances of successively lower trophic-level species. While prey may increase in number with fewer predators, they may also alter their behavior. When such behavioral responses impact the food resources of prey species, behaviorally mediated trophic cascades can dramatically shape landscapes. It remains unclear whether this pathway of change is typically <b>triggered</b> by ocean <b>fishing.</b> By coupling a simple foraging model with empirical observations from coral reefs, we provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and predicting how predator harvest can alter the landscape of risk for herbivores and consequently drive dramatic changes in primary producer distributions. These results broaden trophic cascade predictions for fisheries to include behavioral changes. They also {{provide a framework for}} detecting the presence and magnitude of behaviorally mediated cascades. This knowledge will help to reconcile the disparity between expected and observed patterns of fishing-induced cascades in the sea. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{excessive}} {{fishing activities}} {{have led to}} the depletion of many coastal fisheries resources in most of the countries in Southeast Asia. It is therefore necessary to find out the causal factors of excessive fishing in order to build up effective fisheries management system. This paper highlights {{the results of the study}} that investigated the overfishing or excessive fishing in Batan Estuary, Aklan, Central Philippines. The data were gathered through an interview of selected households in Barangay Pinamuk-an, Aklan from March 2 - 26 2010. Of the 93 respondent-households, 67 or 72 % is engaged in fishing. The most popular fishing gear was the small set net with synthetic fiber, which was introduced to the community in the latter part of 1970 s. The relatively lower cost of this small fishing gear, and a few labor force requirement, including its availability in nearby market made it easier for the fisherfolks to acquire this fishing gear. The small set net with synthetic fiber has been widely used by the fishers, which led to the overuse of the fishing grounds in the Batan Estuary. Thus, this paper argues that the introduction of new fishing gear and method <b>triggered</b> the excessive <b>fishing</b> in coastal areas in Philippines...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{organised}} {{illegal fishing}} and trade in abalone {{from the late}} 1990 s destabilised South Africa’s historically stable, quota-managed fishery, culminating in its closure in 2008. The development of the fishery is described in a historical context, including the evolution of South Africa’s science-based abalone fishery management system. The diverse suite of responses deployed to combat illegal fishing and the black market trade in abalone are reviewed, including;- fishery reform to expand rights to {{a greater number of}} previously disadvantaged fishers, a territorial user rights fishery (TURF) system, special compliance operations and courts, the CITES listing of abalone, and the serial reduction in the TAC, culminating in the controversial and legally contested closure of the fishery. The main causes of the rise of the illegal fishery are diagnosed as 1) the massive increase in the abalone price that occurred in the 1990 s <b>triggering</b> an abalone <b>fishing</b> “gold-rush” and 2) the failure of the post-Apartheid fishery reform process to accommodate many traditional fishers in a legal fishing rights framework resulting in them operating outside the formal fishery management system. By contextualising the abalone fishery as a complex system, embedded in South Africa’s socio-political setting, we show how the resource focussed fishery management system did not have the capacity to incorporate the powerful social, political and economic drivers determining fisher behaviour. We conclude with the need to revisit South Africa’s abalone fishery management paradigm, and argue that a more integrated governance approach is required that takes into account the biological, socio-political and economic factors determining the fishery activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{development of}} aquaculture {{has increased the}} interest in infectious diseases of cultured fish, due to the economic losses caused by them. Although at present there are successful vaccines against bacteria, therapeutic treatments for viral diseases {{have yet to be}} established, in part {{due to the lack of}} information regarding the defense mechanisms <b>triggered</b> during infections. <b>Fish</b> have an innate and an acquired immune system, the former is the first line of defense and therefore an important protection against pathogens. The reason is the relatively inefficiency of the acquired immune response of fish in comparison with the unspecific response, given the evolutionary status and poikilothermic nature of these animals. In spite of this, not many genes related to the innate immune system in fish have been cloned. However, this number has increased lately owing to the recent advances in the study of simultaneously gene expression (Expression Sequence Tags, ESTs, and microarrays). The use of these techniques (genomic and proteomic) together with functional studies of gene expression in vivo and in vitro will favour future aquaculture development. In this sense, many genes and regulatory pathways of biological processes in general and defense mechanisms in particular could be identified and characterized. This knowledge will allow not only to determine the molecular basis of these responses, but can also be used in the improvement of cultured species via effective fight strategies against pathogens, new vaccine design and genetic selection of disease resistant species. In this chapter we review the application of these genomic techniques used to study immune response and disease resistance of mainly non salmonid fish.
