5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> being righted and reattached within days.|$|E

After a {{selection}} process, 19 of these songs were removed, however some of them {{made it to the}} deluxe edition released later in 2008. The first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] was written in 2007, and went through two or three changes before Adams made the finishing touches.

In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my head and I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I almost didn’t bring it to the band because I was thinking to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing.

500|$|It {{was when}} the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having {{recalled}} the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created {{around the time of the}} Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the [...] "worst kind of people." [...] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. He added time travel next, but said he had a hard <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.|$|E

2500|$|In 1892 and 1895, Lorentz {{worked on}} {{describing}} electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move {{relative to the}} postulated luminiferous aether. He discovered that the transition {{from one to another}} reference frame could be simplified by using a new time variable that he called local time and which depended on universal time and the location under consideration. Although Lorentz did not give a detailed interpretation of the physical significance of local <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> he could explain the aberration of light and the result of the Fizeau experiment. In 1900 and 1904, Henri Poincaré called local time Lorentz's [...] "most ingenious idea" [...] and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame (see Einstein synchronisation and Relativity of simultaneity). In 1892, with the attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz also proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (see length contraction; George FitzGerald had already arrived at this conclusion in 1889).|$|E

2500|$|At the Royal Rumble, Guerrero entered at No. 1 {{and lasted}} 28:11 before being eliminated. In a skit before the Rumble, {{he drew his}} number the same time Ric Flair drew his. In {{an attempt to get}} a better draw, Guerrero {{switched}} his number with Flair's (and stole Flair's wallet in the process). Theodore Long made him return both items before the match. Flair would enter at No. 30. At No Way Out, Guerrero teamed up with longtime friend and sometimes rival, Rey Mysterio and defeated The Basham Brothers to win his final title, the WWE Tag Team Championship for a fourth <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> being Mysterio's third reign. Many expected the new champions to defend their title at WrestleMania 21, but after encouragement from Chavo, Guerrero challenged Mysterio to a one-on-one match instead so they could [...] "bring the house down". The two wrestled a match at WrestleMania with Mysterio getting the win. Although visibly frustrated, Guerrero congratulated his partner. After several mishaps in the weeks following WrestleMania, the growing tension between Guerrero and Mysterio finally erupted when they lost their tag team championship to the new team MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury) on the April 21 episode of SmackDown!. Although the next week they received a rematch to regain the title, Guerrero slowly began turning heel again by abandoning his partner, whom he had considered [...] "his family" [...] earlier in the show.|$|E

Marty gives Emmett a sealed note with instructions to be opened in the future. Shortly after, a second DeLorean appears with Doc at the wheel, having been summoned from the present by the note. As they talk about events, the town of Hill Valley disappears around them. They find, from Marty's great-grandfather William [...] "Willie" [...] McFly, that the town burned down shortly after its founding in 1876. Doc and Marty use the time machine to return to 1876, discovering a crazed Edna had traveled there and attempted to burn down the tavern which had led to the whole town becoming ablaze. They find and stop Edna in time before she can commit the act, returning her and the first DeLorean back to the restored Hill Valley of 1931. Edna is quickly arrested as she continues to ramble about her act of arson, and put into jail with Kid. The alternate DeLorean disappears. As Marty and Doc are preparing to return, Marty spots Artie and Trixie, having {{fallen in love with}} each other, and worries about his future since Artie was to be wed to his grandmother Sylvia, but Trixie reveals that Sylvia is her real name.|$|E

Within the month my cigar had grown to such proportions that I could have used it as a crutch.

He only knew, or surmised, that all these important people were occupied in doing him to death, but the process, the meaning of their fine phrases, he could not follow. He looked at them, his glazed eyes travelling from face to face, to be fixed finally on the judge, in a vacant stare; but he scarcely saw them, he was all the time gazing on, and his mind occupied with, other forms and scenes invisible to the court. His village, his Marty, his dear little playmate of long ago, the sweet girl he had won, the wife and mother of his children, with her white, terrified face, clinging to him and crying in anguish: [...] "Oh, Johnnie, what will they do to 'ee?"

6000|$|On the whole, we {{will repeat}} that this Religion of Mahomet's {{is a kind}} of Christianity; has a genuine element of what is spiritually highest looking through it, not to be hidden by all its imperfections. The Scandinavian God Wish, the god of all rude men,--this has been {{enlarged}} into a Heaven by Mahomet; but a Heaven symbolical of sacred Duty, and to be earned by faith and well-doing, by valiant action, and a divine patience which is still more valiant. It is Scandinavian Paganism, and a truly celestial element superadded to that. Call it not false; look not at the falsehood of it, look at the truth of it. For these twelve centuries, it has been the religion and life-guidance of the fifth part of the whole kindred of Mankind. Above all things, it has been a religion heartily believed. These Arabs believe their religion, and try to live by it!
