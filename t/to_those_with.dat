5|$|An {{ambulance}} is {{a vehicle}} for transportation, from or between places of treatment, {{and in some instances}} will also provide out of hospital medical care to the patient.

5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} {{is important in}} the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E
5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> little or no functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared {{the use of a}} speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's charred corpse {{was taken}} from the {{wreckage}} of Q turret in the aftermath of battle and buried at sea with full honours alongside the other 98 fatal casualties Lion had suffered. His bravery in the face of certain death did not go unnoticed; he was mentioned by name in Admiral Jellicoe's post-battle dispatch and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Harvey's widow Ethel was presented with the award at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 15 September 1916. His medal group was later loaned to the Royal Marines Museum, Eastney Barracks by his son Lieutenant-Colonel John Malcolm Harvey of the King's Regiment in 1973. Harvey's name is inscribed on the Chatham Naval Memorial <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> no known grave, administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.|$|E
5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that thiomersal {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs {{were higher in the}} birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that thiomersal could not be the primary cause of autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism.|$|E
5|$|The older {{stations}} on the North South and East West {{lines were}} originally built with no accessibility facilities, such as lifts, ramps, tactile guidance systems (Braille tactiles {{on the floor}} surface), wider fare gates, or toilets for passengers with disabilities; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled. Now, these facilities are being progressively installed {{as part of a}} programme to make all stations accessible to the elderly and <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. All stations are now barrier-free, although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier-free facilities. The installation of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013.|$|E

5|$|Hammond married Dorothy Lister almost {{immediately}} after returning home, just before the 1929 season began. Gloucestershire's inspirational new captain, Bev Lyon, led another Gloucestershire challenge for the County Championship. He used Hammond's bowling less due {{to the emergence of}} Tom Goddard, but Hammond was less dominant with the bat than was expected. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,456 runs at an average of 64.63. He played in four of the five Tests against South Africa, missing the fourth due to injury; he also suffered an injury in the second Test which required him to use a runner. Adopting tactics similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> which he had success in Australia, he scored two centuries—an unbeaten 138 in the first Test, and a match-saving 101 not out in the final Test which gave England a 2–0 series victory. His only other innings over fifty was played in the third Test. He ended the series with 352 runs at an average of 58.66. At the time, critics considered him the best batsman in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant governor, admitting {{that he considered}} the office a stepping stone to some day becoming governor. He was elected, but experienced a poor relationship with Governor Wallace Wilkinson throughout their four-year terms. Jones was elected governor in 1991, turning back a challenge from Governor Wilkinson's wife Martha in the Democratic primary. (Wilkinson was ineligible to succeed himself in office.) Although Jones maintained a strained relationship with the Kentucky General Assembly following comments he made {{in the wake of}} the federal Operation Boptrot investigation, he was still able to pass much of his agenda, including an amendment that would allow state officials to succeed themselves in office once. (Jones was able to secure passage of the amendment by exempting the state's sitting officials, including himself.) However, he achieved only a partial victory on his top priority– health care reform. While the legislature acceded to many of Jones' proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians. Following his term in office, Jones founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project. He considered running for governor again in 2003, but never formally became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{scientists}} discovered several {{different forms of}} meats ants, forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group; three forms were identified (the regular I. purpureus {{and the other two}} forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus), differing in colour and nest structure. However, as there were no clear morphological differences among these variations, the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain. Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen, <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a yellowish body and a bluish-purple gaster. Others may be darker, appearing metallic-bluish to purplish-black. Owing to their different geographical ranges, the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated, based on examinations where multiple forms were sympatric. Each form had its own geographical limit, although the regular I. purpureus form is very common, inhabiting at least one-third of the Australian continent. Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats; for example, one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas, and others in cool and dry areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must be legible.

For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if <b>those</b> familiar <b>with</b> cursive can read it.|$|R

5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
