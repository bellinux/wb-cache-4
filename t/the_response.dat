40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Bayesian method to set {{tolerance}} or specification limits {{on one or}} more responses and obtain optimal values {{for a set of}} controllable factors. The existence of such controllable factors (or parameters) that can be manipulated by the process engineer and that affect <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> is assumed. <b>The</b> dependence between the controllable factors and <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> is assumed to be captured by a regression model fit from experimental data, where the data is assumed to be available. The proposed method finds the optimal setting of the control factors (parameter design) and the corresponding specification limits for <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> (tolerance control) in order to achieve a desired posterior probability of conformance of <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> to their specifications. Contrary to standard approaches in this area, the proposed Bayesian approach uses the complete posterior predictive distribution of <b>the</b> <b>responses,</b> thus <b>the</b> tolerances and settings obtained consider implicitly both the mean and variance of <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> and <b>the</b> uncertainty in the regression model parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT (a) <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> of <b>the</b> {{vomeronasal organ}} to general odorants in the turtle, Geoclerays reevesii, were {{measured}} by recording the accessory olfactory bnlbar <b>responses.</b> <b>The</b> threshold concentrations of <b>the</b> vomeronasal <b>responses</b> to various odorants {{were similar to}} those in main olfactory bulbar responses, indicating that vomeronasal cells lacking cilia and olfactory cells having many cilia have similar sensitivities to general odorants. (b) The vomeronasal epithelium was perfused with 100 mM NaCI solution and the salt-free solution and the effects of NaC 1 on <b>the</b> vomeronasal <b>responses</b> to various odorants were examined. There was no essential difference between the concentration-response curves for n-amyl acetate and menthone dissolved in 100 mM NaCI solution and those dissolved in the salt-free solution in the whole concentration range examined. The ratios of <b>the</b> magnitudes ofvomeronasal <b>responses</b> in <b>the</b> salt-free solution to those in 100 mM NaC 1 solution were between 1. 01 and 1. 10 for seven odorants tested. (c) <b>The</b> magnitudes of <b>responses</b> to <b>the</b> odorants were unchanged by changes in NaCl concentrations. The replacement of Na + with organic cations such as choline +, Bis-Tris propane 2 +, and N-acetyl-n-glucosamine + did not affect the magnitudes of <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> to <b>the</b> odorants. The Na channel blocker amiloride also did not affect <b>the</b> <b>responses.</b> (d) <b>The</b> vomeronasal <b>responses</b> were practically unchanged by changes in CaCI~ concentration.
