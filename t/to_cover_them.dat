The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Singh Negi and Khudadad Khan. Negi was presented with the VC by King George V two days earlier, on 5 December 1914, during a visit to troops in France. He is one of a small number of soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette.|$|E

5|$|Like the infantry, the {{engineers}} {{had been pushed}} off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in {{where there were no}} infantry or armor <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them.</b> Working under heavy fire, {{the engineers}} set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.|$|E

In addition to reinforcing their walls with clay, they made netting screens ten centimeters thick and ten meters in length <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them</b> and dampen projectile impact. As a result, the Yuan siege weapons were both ineffective and inaccurate, and the few shots that did land bounced off the wall harmlessly.|$|E

The Prince lost that day around 35 soldiers killed and 50 wounded. The French losses could have been higher if the Spanish cavalry had crossed the river in time to pursue them, but this did not happen and Soissons was able to withdraw his troops in good order.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup poll, 43% of Bulgarians {{regarded}} the media {{reporting on the}} protests as objective, while 30% characterized the electronic and printed media outlets as displaying subjectivity in their coverage. Of the latter respondents, 19% considered the bias to be pro-protest and 11% identified it as pro-government. The electronic and print media in Bulgaria are generally regarded as tending {{to shy away from}} publishing materials explicitly critical of governments, but businessman and direct democracy supporter Petar Klisarov insists that the main media were passive and relatively objective in their reporting of the 2013 anti-Borisov protests while from the very beginning they unequivocally took the side of the protesters in their coverage of the anti-Oresharski movement. According to academic Orlin Spasov, the protests saw significantly more intra-societal cleavages (Russophiles vs. Russophobes, communists vs. anti-communists and so on) compared to the winter discontent against Borisov's cabinet that mainly juxtaposed the political elites against the people, which made it much more difficult for the media anchors <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them</b> with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 June, a 10-men team led by Subedar Harnam Singh was sent out. Another team led by Subedar Sansar Chand {{followed}} it at a distance. A third team led by Naib Subedar Bana Singh was kept as a reserve force to be deployed in case the first assault team was stalled due to enemy fire. Harnam Singh's team managed to find the rope and the dead bodies of Pande's patrol. The Indian soldiers started climbing the ice wall. They had barely covered a distance of 50 m, when their scout Naik Tara Chand noticed some movement in the front. Alerted by Tara Chand, the Indian soldiers started moving down. But before they could take up the firing positions, the Pakistanis opened fire with medium machine guns. Tara Chand and two others were killed instantaneously. The troops following them were unable to fire back as their weapons had jammed in the -25°C temperature. Later, the Indians found that the Pakistanis were heating their weapons with a kerosene stove kept below the weapon. Harnam Singh's men first took shelter behind icicles, and then hurriedly dug shallow trenches in the ice. The Indian artillery designated <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them</b> {{could not be used}} to full extent, as there was danger of them being hurt. Ultimately, the attack had to be abandoned.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady {{who made}} far more {{use of the}} media than her predecessors; she held 348 press {{conferences}} over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency. Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them.</b> She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip. Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called [...] "Gridiron Widows". [...] She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Mrs. Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever. [...] In {{the early days of}} her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address [...] "politics, legislation, or executive decision,", since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time. She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures. Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with Mrs. Roosevelt, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations.|$|E
500|$|The nests can be {{more than}} two metres (six feet) in {{diameter}} and nearly a metre (three feet) high. Pairs shows high fidelity to the nest site, often refurbishing and reusing a nest {{for as many as}} five breeding seasons. The clutch is one or two eggs (rarely three or four) which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days (range 26–35 days). Eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240grams. When disturbed from the nest, parents may sometimes attempt to conceal the eggs by attempting <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them</b> with material {{from the edge of the}} nest. The eggshells are removed by the parents after the chicks hatch either by carrying away the fragments or by swallowing them. Approximately 30% of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year, and most of the successful pairs raise one or two chicks each, with brood sizes of three being rare. The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. When alarmed, the parent cranes use a low korr-rr call that signals chicks to freeze and lie still. Young birds stay with their parents until the subsequent breeding season. In captivity, birds breed only after their fifth year. The sarus is widely believed to pair for life, however cases of [...] "divorce" [...] and mate replacement have been recorded.|$|E
500|$|Many of the foraging, {{breeding}} and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill. To prevent brain {{damage from the}} rapid and repeated impacts, woodpeckers {{have a number of}} physical features evolved to protect the brain. These include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside the skull during pecking, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible sponge-like bone which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull. Computer simulations have shown that 99.7 percent of the energy generated in pecking was stored in the form of strain energy, which was distributed throughout the bird's body, with only a small remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also heats up the woodpecker's skull, {{which is part of the}} reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool. During the millisecond before contact with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. The nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>them.</b> Woodpeckers are capable of repeated pecking on a tree at high decelerations on the order of [...] (1000 g).|$|E
