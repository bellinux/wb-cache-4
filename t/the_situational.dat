25|$|ISPL {{adheres to}} a {{situational}} approach to manage an acquisition. <b>The</b> <b>situational</b> approach {{takes into account}} properties of the problem situation, which are called situational factors. ISPL provides {{a number of these}} situational factors. Some of these situational factors affect events that have adverse consequences: the risks. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>situational</b> factors and risks within ISPL are related to each other. This makes it possible to provide a number of heuristics on which factors have an influence on certain risks.|$|E
25|$|Fiedler's Contingency Theory {{holds that}} a leader's {{effectiveness}} {{depends on the}} interaction between their characteristics and {{the characteristics of the}} situation. Path–Goal Theory asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet <b>the</b> <b>situational</b> factors. <b>The</b> <b>situational</b> factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model focuses on how leader–subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole. Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model focuses on decision making with respect to a feasibility set which is composed of <b>the</b> <b>situational</b> attributes.|$|E

40|$|Situational {{strength}} {{is considered one}} of <b>the</b> most important <b>situational</b> forces at work because it can attenuate the personality–performance relationship. Although organizational scholars have studied <b>the</b> consequences of <b>situational</b> strength, they have paid little attention to its antecedents. To address this gap, the current study focused on situational strength cues from different social sources as antecedents of overall situational strength at work. Specifically, we examined how employees combine situational strength cues emanating from three social sources (i. e., coworkers, the immediate supervisor, and top management). Based on field theory, we hypothesized that <b>the</b> effect of <b>situational</b> strength from coworkers and immediate supervisors (i. e., proximal sources of situational strength) on employees' perceptions of overall <b>situational</b> strength on <b>the</b> job would be greater than <b>the</b> effect of <b>situational</b> strength from <b>the</b> top management (i. e., the distal source of situational strength). We also hypothesized that <b>the</b> effect of <b>situational</b> strength from <b>the</b> distal source would be mediated by <b>the</b> effects of <b>situational</b> strength from <b>the</b> proximal sources. Data from 363 full-time employees were collected at two time points with a cross-lagged panel design. The former hypothesis was supported for one of <b>the</b> two <b>situational</b> strength facets studied. The latter hypothesis was fully supported...|$|R

[...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting.

2500|$|Investigators then {{focused on}} why the pilots decided to fly the plane direct to point Barru instead to point Siwa. Investigators {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>Situational</b> Awareness {{and the process of}} the decision making to fly direct to Barru. It was revealed that one of the crew had done the same step before, and during the previous flight, no incident occurred. This might have caused one of the crew to trust the one that had done it before in the past to cut the route and make a direct flight to Barru. During its flight to point Barru, neither the pilot or the co-pilot discussed on the environmental condition ahead. The absence of discussion in regard to the conditions ahead, meant that the pilots had not properly considered the operational implications of flying the direct route, leading to a loss of situational awareness.|$|E

2500|$|In The Journal of the American Medical Association, [...] Zimbardo's {{situational}} perspective received {{support from}} other social situational experiments that demonstrated {{the same idea}} and concept. Almost ten {{years prior to the}} Stanford Prison Experiment (1971), Stanley Milgram conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had [...] "teachers" [...] that delivered mock electric shocks to the [...] "learner" [...] for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. <b>The</b> <b>situational</b> force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I advise you to continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E
