5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E
25|$|William's {{childhood}} was an austere one, educated {{at home by}} a Swiss governess, he was sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> at Southwell, Nottinghamshire when he was eight. William's father denied him a public school education, sending him to be educated in classics at the small class of Rev. John Owen Parr. In 1840, Parr moved to Preston and William witnessed the Preston bread riots there in 1842. He left Parr in 1844 and, after two more years' study at home, William entered Trinity College, Cambridge to pursue his interest in mathematics. At Cambridge he became an Apostle, graduating with first-class honours in the classics tripos in 1851, {{but he did not}} enjoy the mathematics, graduating only senior optime.|$|E

25|$|Madigan {{stated the}} {{impeachment}} committee would consider the pending criminal charges {{as well as}} review other possible wrongdoing during Blagojevich's term such as abuse of power, taking action without legal authority, ignoring state laws, and defying lawful requests for information from the General Assembly. Currie further stated that among the controversial actions under review by the committee would be the Blagojevich administration's purchase of a flu vaccine that was never distributed and his unilateral decision to send a $1 million grant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> that was damaged when the historic Pilgrim Baptist Church was destroyed by fire. She also warned that the panel's interest in investigating alleged criminal activities surrounding Blagojevich might be affected by how much cooperation was forthcoming from federal investigators, which {{was supported by a}} formal written request to Prosecutor Fitzgerald. On December 30, Fitzgerald filed a motion to allow the impeachment committee to hear the conversations recorded by wiretap during his federal investigation.|$|E

His mother, Amanda Baskin Goodfellow, {{followed}} {{two years later}} via boat, mule over the Panama Isthmus, {{and then on the}} steamship S.S. Golden Gate to San Francisco. Goodfellow was born on December 23, 1855 in Downieville, California, then one of the largest cities in the state. His parents also had two daughters, Mary Catherine ("Kitty") and Bessie.

25|$|Maggie's {{marriage}} to Mickey Horton {{is central to}} the character, with their relationship being among the most prominent and long-running relationships on the show. Mickey is depicted as a smart, tough lawyer, with Maggie being portrayed as a weak farm girl. Maggie and Mickey were generally depicted as the most stable couple on the show, even after all the torment the two had gone through. During the early years of their marriage, Maggie felt threatened by the presence of his old lover, Linda Patterson, who had pretended to be Maggie's friend but was secretly trying to win Mickey back. Linda had claimed that Mickey was her daughter Melissa's father, but Linda's estranged husband Jim Phillips revealed that Linda had lied. While Linda went on to other relationships (including Mickey's brother Tommy and the wealthy Bob Anderson whom she married), she continued to remain a thorn in Maggie's side. After Bob Anderson's death, Melissa ran away from the neglectful Linda and eventually Mickey and Maggie took her in, sending her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> outside of Salem.|$|E

500|$|Zecker {{remarked that}} in an ironic twist, {{immediately}} after the riots, Desdemona's family is shamed by a white realtor who [...] "doubts their fitness (whiteness)" [...] {{to live in the}} rich city Grosse Point. In the 1970s, African Americans, instead of Mediterraneans, were discriminated against through redlining. Zecker opined that by framing African Americans as the [...] "eternal destroyers" [...] and white ethnics as [...] "yet again the oppressed innocents", Eugenides [...] "captures perfectly the dominant narrative of urban decline in the early twenty-first century American Zeitgeist." [...] Insurance settlement from the damage caused at the riots allows the Stephanides to purchase a home away from the African Americans.

In 1874 he was sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{no school}} in Aldeburgh so Garrett learned the three Rs from her mother. When she was 10 years old, a governess, Miss Edgeworth, a poor gentlewoman, was {{employed}} to educate Garrett and her sister.
