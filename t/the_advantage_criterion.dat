In this dissertation, a Bayesian estimation method is presented called the Poisson Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) image restoration algorithm. The Poisson MAP algorithm is shown to be slightly different in its design but similar in super resolution ability to the Poisson Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the Poisson MAP algorithm in almost all cases achieves legitimate bandwidth extension and thus achieves super resolution. Practical criteria for indicating when the algorithm has numerically converged are reviewed. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> of these <b>criteria</b> are discussed. The theoretical convergence properties of the Poisson MAP algorithm are investigated. The iterative algorithm is viewed as a nonlinear vector mapping in the N-dimensional real Euclidean vector space, Rᴺ.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Constitutive models {{based on}} the multilaminate {{framework}} provide an alternative framework to more common formulations in terms of stress invariants. The basic feature of multilaminate models, namely the consideration of various integration planes to formulate the stress-strain relationship has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that yield <b>criteria,</b> flow and hardening rules are formulated on planes rather than in three-dimensional stress space making the mathematics simpler. Stress or strain induced anisotropy is an intrinsic feature of these models and inherent anisotropy can be introduced {{by means of a}} structural tensor which allows the input of orientation dependent strength properties. A number of different constitutive equations for modelling clays and sands {{based on the}} multilaminate framework have been presented in the literature and more recently advanced formulations including small strain stiffness effects or non-local softening behaviour have been developed. In this paper only a very brief summary of the multilaminate model used for the analyses presented in this paper is given. The emphasis is then put on practical applications. First results for slope stability analyses are shown where the consequences of anisotropic strength are highlighted and secondly the influence of considering small strain stiffness effects when simulating a tunnel excavation is discussed. ...|$|R

Introducing target values for lamps and gear and taking into account some basic lighting comfort requirements, the maximum electrical power to be installed can be predicted {{for any kind of}} application. Herewith, one or more task areas with appropriate target illuminance values may be defined. The key parameter of the criterion is the analytical expression for the target utilance as a function of common lighting design parameters. Two practical examples illustrate the validity of the criterion. In a first example, a general case where the task area is coincident with a reference plane parallel with the floor has been studied. The values obtained converge to actual target values in current practice. In a second example, the lighting design of a store with many vertical task areas is explained.
