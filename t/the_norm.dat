5|$|By the 1980s country {{passenger}} services were run down, and older wooden rolling stock was now approaching their use by date. As a result, the N type carriages were introduced from 1981, {{followed by the}} converted H type stock from 1984. Since then, diesel multiple units have become <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for new purchases, with the Sprinter introduced in 1992, and the VLocity from 2005.|$|E

He also promoted a dynamic climbing style and emphasized the importance of strength training to complement technical skill. These practices had not been popular among climbers, but as Gill's ability level and influence grew, his ideas became <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Naylor writes {{books for}} children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor {{typically}} takes {{several years to}} finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and character traits when she thinks of them. She considered Shiloh to be a deviation from <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is {{also known}} to {{occasionally}} trap other small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and certainly do not represent <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other arthropods, such as centipedes, also fall prey to N. rajah.|$|E
5000|$|This norm is {{also called}} <b>the</b> {{supremum}} <b>norm,</b> <b>the</b> Chebyshev <b>norm,</b> or <b>the</b> infinity <b>norm.</b> <b>The</b> name [...] "uniform norm" [...] {{derives from the}} fact that a sequence of functions [...] converges to f under the metric derived from <b>the</b> uniform <b>norm</b> if and only if [...] converges to [...] uniformly.|$|R

5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for young jazz pianists.|$|E
5|$|Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev, {{a fictional}} Kazakh journalist, {{distinguished}} by exaggeratedly strong antisemitism, sexism, and antiziganism, which {{is depicted as}} apparently <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> in his homeland.

5|$|The French {{system of}} {{education}} is <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> and French {{is the language of}} teaching, although the Sango language is promoted in schools. A substantial percentage of the population is literate. Schooling is compulsory for children ages 6 to 14.|$|E
40|$|For decades, {{multinational}} {{businesses have}} self-regulated their operations {{with respect to}} human rights, largely unfettered by international law. In recent years, however, human rights groups have advocated that the United Nations (“UN”) create clear legal obligations for multinationals respecting their human rights-related conduct. At least {{partly due to the}} substantial burden such obligations could place on international businesses, these efforts by human rights proponents have proven largely fruitless [...] until now. On August 13, 2003, the UN Sub-commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights adopted <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> on <b>the</b> Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights (“Norms”). In March and April of this year, the fifty-three-member UN Human Rights Commission will vote regarding whether to adopt <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> into international law. At first glance, <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> seem benign. <b>The</b> document is not directly binding against corporations and has been described by some of its drafters as a mere restatement of existing international human rights laws. A deeper look at <b>the</b> <b>Norms,</b> and <b>the</b> context in which they were drafted, however, reveals that they may be the first major stepping stone toward the adoption of an international, enforceable set of legal obligations binding on transnational corporations (“TNCs”). This Development explores possible long-term effects of <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> on international businesses by briefly (1) describing historical events leading up to <b>the</b> <b>Norms,</b> (2) summarizing <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> 2 ̆ 7 controversial content and commentaries, (3) noting what organizations both for and against <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> are saying about the document, and (4) analyzing <b>the</b> <b>Norms</b> from legal, economic, and political perspectives...|$|R

We present the syntax and operational semantics of generic programming constructs to facilitate runtime norm modification, allowing a programmer to specify when and how <b>the</b> <b>norms</b> may be changed by external agents or by the normative framework. <b>The</b> <b>norms</b> take on <b>the</b> form of conditional obligations and prohibitions, which instantiate detached obligations and prohibitions (instances). We present rule-based constructs for runtime modification of <b>the</b> <b>norms</b> and their instances, and a mechanism for automatically updating the instances when their underlying norms change...|$|R
5|$|The {{restoration}} of Tōdai-ji's Nandaimon gate in 1930 saw improved standards for preservation. An architect supervised the reconstruction works on-site. Extensive restoration reports became <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> including plans, results of surveys, historical sources, and {{documentation of the}} work done. During the 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.|$|E

30|$|A natural {{problem is}} how to compute <b>the</b> nuclear <b>norm</b> of a tensor.

5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 {{and ruled}} until 1143. John was a pious and {{dedicated}} Emperor who {{was determined to}} undo {{the damage to the}} empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E

5|$|Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful, its {{box office}} {{performance}} was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film, The Curse of Frankenstein, {{which was to}} be the first of their many Gothic horror films. As a result it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967. Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E
5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> in the Republican era.
