5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} a temporary structure positioned over <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> the platforms were sheltered with individual awnings {{rather than the}} all-over glazed roof provided at the DR's other stations. Access to the station was via a passageway from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under the road. On 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{important}} for transport along the coast until 1944, when {{the completion of the}} Sørland Line made Flekkefjord a branch station. At the same time, the line was converted to standard gauge, the number of station tracks was reduced, and the station received an overhaul. The station building was demolished in 1970, but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> depot buildings still exist.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> ties started. The work to build <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E

5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> installation of {{a new system of}} electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> <b>and</b> thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent {{decline in the number}} of passengers, possibly brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.|$|E

5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E

The freighthouse, built in 1878, does still stand, and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of two farmers' markets in Ypsilanti.

5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2003, Oslo Sporveier was reorganized {{with the}} {{operation}} of the trams transferred to Oslo Sporvognsdrift ("Oslo Tram Operations") and {{the operation of}} the Metro to Oslo T-banedrift ("Oslo Metro Operations"). Another reorganization was made on 1 July 2006, when Oslo Sporveier was demerged into two companies. The Oslo Public Transport Administration, which kept the Oslo Sporveier brand name, was made responsible for purchasing and the marketing of the public transport system. The ownership and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> stations was transferred to Kollektivtransportproduksjon ("Public Transport Production"). The latter also became the parent of the operating companies, who retained the actual running of the trams and metro trains. The brand name Oslo Sporveier was discontinued on 1 January 2008, when Ruter was created as a merger between the Oslo Public Transport Administration and Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk ("Greater Oslo Local Traffic")—which had been responsible for public transport in Akershus.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed.

5|$|Reaching {{the top of}} the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group {{ran into}} heavy {{opposition}} from an Italian Bersaglieri infantry company, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the Bersaglieri found their 47mm anti-tank guns to be unable to penetrate the armour of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets. Now aiming at <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks, seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class. At the cost of these seven tanks, the position was taken by CSquadron 4RTR and GCompany 2nd Scots Guards, and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken in the face of limited opposition.|$|E
