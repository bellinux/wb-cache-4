5|$|Brown said {{he wanted}} to release more land and ease access to {{ownership}} with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> eco-towns, each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 home-owners – up to 100,000 new homes in total.|$|E
5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> battleships {{was originally}} tendered in 1912, {{after years of}} concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E

50|$|The Bulloch Grand Jury {{decided in}} spring of 1894 <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a <b>new</b> courthouse. The two-story {{building}} was sold after the Grand Jury decided <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a <b>new</b> courthouse. By December 1894 the new courthouse was built. The {{total cost of}} the courthouse was twenty thousand dollars, which included furnishings.|$|R
5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread over the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E
5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing {{the track and}} field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay for}} a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK170,000 it cost to move Grand's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the {{new stadium}} {{finished}} on time in August 1999, {{paving the way for}} Cleveland to host a football game {{for the first time in}} more than three years. During the years after Modell's move and the Browns' suspension, a dozen new stadiums were built for NFL teams. Citing the precedent set by the Browns' relocation, NFL owners used the threat of a move to convince their cities <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> stadiums with public funds.|$|E

5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>New</b> College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Arabs from Umm al-Fahm {{migrated}} to al-Lajjun {{to make use}} of its farmland. Gradually, they settled in the village, building their houses around the springs, especially next to the khan. When the massive mound at nearby Tall al-Mutasallim (ancient Megiddo) was excavated by German archaeologists in 1903, some of the inhabitants of Lajjun reused stones from the ancient structure that had been unearthed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> housing.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2014, Modi {{launched}} the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ("Clean India") campaign. The stated {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging. The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.|$|E

5|$|Since preservation, {{the railway}} has {{operated}} {{as a tourist}} attraction, expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place, including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|A {{civilian}} government {{was established in}} 1922 with its headquarters at Koror, replacing the military administration. The {{civilian government}} initiated a programme to identify and collectivise unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment. Much of these land were used <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> industrial estates and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa. In Japan, the government actively encouraged the Japanese and Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia, including Palau, and began establishing farming settlements. The first farming settlement was established at Ngaremlengui in 1926, but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930, although later settlements were established more successfully.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, {{the company}} {{developed}} its own research office and used computer software originally {{developed for the}} design of space shuttles. It reduced the time needed <b>to</b> design and <b>build</b> <b>new</b> prototypes <b>to</b> about six months. Another six months are needed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a <b>new</b> bus prototype.|$|R
50|$|Poor {{building}} standards and ageing have been highlighted by crumbling facades which have hurt and killed {{people in the}} area. The demolition of older flats have given means for developers to acquire land in To Kwa Wan <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>newer</b> and more profitable residential flats.|$|R
50|$|The house {{changed hands}} during the decades that {{followed}} {{and many of}} Prehen's fine old trees were cut down by a timber merchant <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>newer</b> houses. Prehen Park, a nearby private housing estate in Brickkilns was built on Prehen's borders in the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans began <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, {{picking up speed}} towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E
5|$|In 1338 Southampton was raided by French forces; the town's defences proved inadequate, {{particularly}} {{along the}} quays {{on the west}} {{and south of the}} city. Edward III ordered some immediate improvements to Southampton's town walls {{but it was not until}} the 1360s that substantial work began. Over the coming decades the town was entirely enclosed by a 2km (1.25-mile) long stone wall, with 29 towers and eight gates. With the advent of gunpowder weapons in the 1360s and 1370s, Southampton was one of the first towns in England to install the new technology to existing fortifications and <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> towers specifically to house cannon.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, {{called in}} the {{architect}} William Burn <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> stables {{to the east of}} the house, in collaboration with W. A. Nesfield, who had designed the parterres. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of Saint George and the Dragon dated c. 184957 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone orangery, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{the legacy of the}} League of Nations started to be {{reviewed}} by historians as the League Archives at Geneva were better explored, and the United Nations faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>new</b> roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} demand for passengers, it has now become {{apparent}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a <b>new,</b> more modern airport with much more capacity for both commercial and cargo flights.
