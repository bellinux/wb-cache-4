500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in Mylar curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared {{on the stage and}} the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show – Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground", and raised a rifle above her head. Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E
