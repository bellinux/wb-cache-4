40|$|In this paper, 4 -node to 7 -node hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> are {{developed}} for automatic adaptive refinement analysis of plane elasticity problems. The displacement-based <b>transition</b> quadrilateral <b>elements</b> are first adopted {{and applied to}} refinement analysis using both full and reduced integration schemes. As the stress field over the displacement-based <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> is not continuous, a more smooth stress pattern is desirable and could enhance {{the performance of the}} element. Indeed, continuous stress field of various orders can be easily introduced into a displacement-based element through a variational procedure based on the Hellinger-Reissner functional. Of the same kinematics and displacement pattern, the resulting hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> are more superior to the displacement-based elements in possessing a more continuous high quality stress field within the <b>element.</b> The hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> are tested with classical benchmark examples, and the results indicate that hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> are consistently more efficient than the displacement-based counterparts in adaptive refinement analysis. A more economical rank-deficient version of hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> is also available. While they are less expensive to evaluate, they enjoy a very similar convergence rate as the rank-sufficient hybrid-stress <b>transition</b> <b>elements.</b> © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
