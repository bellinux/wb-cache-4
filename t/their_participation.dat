40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue that Christopher Kutz misapplies {{his theory of}} joint action when he {{attributes}} shareowners responsibilities {{on the basis of}} <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> in the corporations in which they invest.

If shareholders’ accountability is grounded in <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> in the stock market, then shareholders cannot take responsibility for corporation’s individual actions. Instead they are solely responsible for the benefits they gain from holding shares if these are a result of moral wrongdoing and for this they should be held accountable...|$|R
