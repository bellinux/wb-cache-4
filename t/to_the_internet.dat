This paper describes a model for design, which has been used <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> <b>Internet's</b> capabilities in health research beyond the elementary posting of facts through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collection of data.

5000|$|The {{very first}} metaphor <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> was <b>the</b> World Wide Web proposed in 1989.

A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was Cyberspace coined by William Gibson in his novel Neuromancer <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> world of computers and the society that gathers around them.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study sought <b>to</b> {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{factors that}} influence students’ intention <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes in Universiti Utara Malaysia. This study applies theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as the base model. The model employed the original variables from the theory i. e. attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention. Method – A survey involving of questionnaires was conducted among 369 public university students. Multiple regression was employed <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> factors influencing intention <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes. Findings – Results revealed that the variables attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control are statistically significant in influencing intention <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for learning purposes. It was also found that 38 % {{of the variance in}} students’ intention <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> is cumulatively explained by their attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Significance – The paper provides useful scientific insight into the relationships between attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control variables towards intention <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes. The ﬁndings can be used <b>to</b> promote <b>the</b> use of <b>Internet</b> among students in enhancing their learning experience...|$|R

Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech.

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
