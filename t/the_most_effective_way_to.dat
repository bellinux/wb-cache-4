5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised {{in the days}} following that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1995, the ODA {{has used}} the Hinomaru motif in their {{official}} logo. The design itself was not created by the government (the logo was chosen from 5,000 designs submitted by the public) but the government was trying increase the visualization of the Hinomaru through their aid packages and development programs. According to the ODA, {{the use of the}} flag is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> symbolize aid provided by the Japanese people.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> purify {{uranium oxide}} in a {{laboratory}} was {{to take advantage of}} the fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates {{the risk of}} toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram {{appears to be the}} best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E

For this reason, he believes that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> bring about change would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's own clothes.|$|E

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.|$|E

25|$|Claude Malhuret {{was elected}} {{as the new}} {{president}} of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of témoignage ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent, was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> solve a problem.|$|E

Devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.|$|E
