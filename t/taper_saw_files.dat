50|$|Wax carving is {{the shaping}} of wax using tools usually {{associated}} with machining: rotary tools, <b>saws,</b> <b>files</b> and burins or gravers.

50|$|To carve wax, {{the proper}} {{size and shape}} of block or tube is chosen, in the {{preferred}} hardness, and cut to a rough size, as needed. Then the design is generally drawn or laid out on that, and <b>saws,</b> <b>files</b> or machine tools are used to work the wax into a finished product. The wax is easily taken to a fine finish in the end using a bit of nylon stocking or steel wool. After the wax product is finished, it may be molded or used in the lost wax casting process to create a final cast product.|$|R

25|$|Excavations at {{this site}} also yielded a number of objects related to slave life at Poplar Forest. Archaeologists {{discovered}} iron <b>saw</b> <b>files,</b> gimlets, wedges, croze irons, and a hinge from a folding ruler; {{it is likely that}} these objects are from tools used by slaves either in their work assignments or in their personal space. Scissors, straight pins, and thimbles found at the site suggest that women sewed for both work and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food; enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.|$|R

The first I entered was very small--just large enough to contain a bed, a table, and a chest, leaving little room for the occupant to move about in; and yet, from the appearance of things, he did move about in it to some purpose, as the table was strewn {{with a number of}} <b>saws,</b> <b>files,</b> bits of ivory and wood, and in a corner a small vice held the head of a cane in its iron jaws. These were mixed with a number of Indian account-books and an inkstand, so that I concluded I had stumbled on the bedroom of my friend Mr Wilson, the postmaster.|$|R
5000|$|A key {{moment was}} while {{studying}} at the Munich academy around 1991/92 when instead of melting down the old jewellery I bought for casting, I started {{to fix the}} pieces instead.

60|$|The future {{effect of}} the Whig propositions of '41 will not be {{detrimental}} to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated piecemeal, as {{will probably be the}} case, by their Conservative successors. But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more conducive to their precipitate fall. Great interests were menaced by a weak government. The consequence was inevitable. Tadpole and <b>Taper</b> <b>saw</b> it in a moment. They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming storm. Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies, there was a little latent jealousy between them. Tadpole worshipped Registration: Taper, adored a Cry. Tadpole always maintained that it was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day; Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour. It always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued Parliament.|$|R

40|$|We experimented {{the cutting}} ability and the {{finishing}} state of cutting surface profile according to three type teeth of electric circular saw used at present for artificial green pruning operation. The experimental factors are Saw Type (tipped <b>saw,</b> original <b>saw,</b> <b>filed</b> <b>saw),</b> Size of Twig (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), Cutting Speed (fast, slow), Species of Twig (Sugi, Hinoki), Cutting Angle (90 °, 45 °), and Moisture Condition of twig (dry, wet, live). We investigated these factors {{according to the}} experimental designs of orthogonal array L_ (3 _). The results are as follows; we can make cutting time shorter on cutting a twig "fast" and perpendicullarly to longitudinal direction of a twig, and save cutting energy with a thin edge blade and at "fast" Cutting Speed. But on the other hand, we need to prune at "slow" Cutting Speed and perpendicularly to longitudinal direction of a twig for preventing from the defects such as hang-nails or splits {{on the surface of}} the pruned tree. As pruning operation is popularly performed in drywinter season, so it is important to pay extra attention to pruning "small" twigs, which are apt to split電動丸鋸による枝打ち作業について鋸断性能と鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を調べるために, 歯形 (チップドソー, 鋸歯, 目立て歯), 枝の径 (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), 鋸断速度 (速, 遅), 枝の樹種 (スギ, ヒノキ), 鋸断角度 (90 °, 45 °) および枝の乾燥状態 (乾, 湿, 生) の 6 因子を取り上げ, 直交表L_ (3 _) に従って実験計画を組み各因子の要因分析を行った。その結果, 枝軸に直角に素早く枝打ちすることで, 鋸断時間は短縮され, 一方鋸断速度を"速", 刃先の厚みの薄い歯を使用することで鋸断消費エネルギーは少なくなるが, しかし鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を良くするには鋸断速度を遅く, 枝軸に直角に当てる枝打ちがよい。また枝打ちは冬期の乾燥時期が最盛期であるから, 枝打ち面の割れ等を防ぐために, 小さい枝を打つときは特に注意が肝要である...|$|R
60|$|A {{great and}} priceless {{thing is a}} new interest! How it takes {{possession}} of a man! how it clings to him, how it rides him! I strode onward from the Schwarenbach hostelry a changed man, a reorganized personality. I walked into a new world, I saw with new eyes. I had been looking aloft at the giant show-peaks only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude, and their unspeakable grace of form; I looked up at them now, as also things to be conquered and climbed. My sense of their grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired; I had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones. I followed the steep lines up, inch by inch, with my eye, and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet. When I saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds, I tried to imagine I <b>saw</b> <b>files</b> of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer thread.|$|R
50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a <b>saw</b> or <b>file,</b> or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
50|$|Shake blocks {{are split}} into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a {{hydraulic}} press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet. These blanks are uniform in thickness throughout if split {{from the same}} edge without flipping the block. Alternatively, the splitter may flip the block after a blank is taken off each edge, which results in a tapered split from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through a large band saw, pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a <b>tapered</b> shake, <b>sawn</b> on one face.|$|R
5000|$|Shingles are {{cut from}} the blocks using a {{circular}} saw, typically 42-48 inches in diameter. The blocks are clamped in a carriage which slides {{back and forth across}} the blade, tilting and moving the block closer to the blade with each pass to automatically form a tapered cut of the correct thickness. The edges of the shingle are then cut with another circular saw called a [...] "trim saw", to remove irregular edges. The result is a <b>tapered</b> shingle <b>sawn</b> on all six sides. The thickness of the butt, or thicker end of the tapered cut, is usually 3/8 inch thick, but is also commonly made to be 5/8 inch, and can be made to any custom specifications.|$|R

60|$|I went tiptoeing {{into the}} hall and peeped over the {{banisters}} while Ella opened the door. I heard a voice which I recognized as that of Perry Blackwood's father asking for Mr. Paret; and then to my astonishment, I <b>saw</b> <b>filing</b> after him into the parlour some ten or twelve persons. With the exception of Mr. Ogilvy, who belonged to one of our old families, and Mr. Watling, a lawyer who had married the youngest of Gene Hollister's aunts, the visitors entered stealthily, after the manner of burglars; some of these were heavy-jowled, and all had an air of mystery that raised my curiosity and excitement to the highest pitch. I caught hold of Ella as she came up the stairs, but she tore herself free, and announced to my father that Mr. Josiah Blackwood and other gentlemen had asked to see him. My father seemed puzzled as he went downstairs.... A long interval elapsed, during which I did not make even a pretence of looking at my arithmetic. At times the low hum of voices rose to what was almost an uproar, and on occasions I distinguished a marked Irish brogue.|$|R
50|$|According to {{a recent}} episode of What History Forgot on the American Heroes Network, Gigli saws also were sent to British POWs held by the Germans, in a little known escape scheme. A British company {{licensed}} to produce London versions of the board game Monopoly by Parker Brothers, the manufacturer, worked closely with Military Intelligence to hide saws and other tools, money, and maps inside the double-thick boards. Apparently, every RAF air squadron had officers trained in escape. When they were captured, they knew where to write to announce that they were now prisoners-of-war, and where they were being held. In return, these officers would be sent one of the special Monopoly games, via the International Red Cross care package. When the escape-trained officer opened it {{and saw that the}} board had a dot on the parking square, he knew {{to take it to the}} most private place he could find and open it to access its contents.
