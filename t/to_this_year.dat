500|$|The sermons of Photius {{offer no}} {{clue as to}} {{the outcome of the}} {{invasion}} or the reasons why the Rus' withdrew to their own country. Later sources attribute their retreat to the Emperor's speedy return to the capital. As the story goes, after Michael and Photius put the veil of the Theotokos into the sea, there arose a tempest which dispersed the boats of the barbarians. In later centuries, it was said that the Emperor hurried to the church at Blachernae and had the robe of the Theotokos carried in procession along the Theodosian Walls. This precious Byzantine relic was dipped symbolically into the sea and a great wind immediately arose and wrecked the Rus' ships. The pious legend was recorded by George Hamartolus, whose manuscript was an important [...] source for the Primary Chronicle. The authors of the Kievan chronicle appended the names of Askold and Dir to the account as they believed that these two Varangians had presided over Kiev in 866. It was <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> that (through some quirk in chronology) they attributed the first Rus' expedition against the Byzantine capital.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} time in the history of The Boat Race that the three main races, the men's, women's and men's reserves', were held on the same day and on the same course along the Tideway. Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> the women's race which first took place in 1927, was usually held at the Henley Boat Races along the [...] course. [...] However, on at least two {{occasions}} in the interwar period, the women competed on the Thames between Chiswick and Kew. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 2014 race by four lengths, with Cambridge leading 41–28 overall. For the third year, the men's race was sponsored by BNY Mellon while the women's race saw BNY Mellon's subsidiary Newton Investment Management as sponsors. It was part of the sponsorship deal with Newton Investment Management that mandated the women's race to be rowed on the same course and with the same funding as the men's race. According to their chief executive, Helena Morrissey, the company [...] "didn't just want a name on a shirt; [...] wanted to do something meaningful". The women's race was scheduled to take place at 4:50p.m., the men's reserves' race half an hour later and the men's race a further half-hour after that at 5:50p.m. The women's reserve race between Cambridge's Blondie and Oxford's Osiris took place on the Tideway for the first time, one day before the main races, at 4:05p.m.|$|E

2500|$|Miami-Dade County has {{operated}} under a unique metropolitan system of government, a [...] "two-tier federation," [...] since 1957.

Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> home rule {{did not exist in}} Florida, and all counties were limited to the same set of powers by the Florida Constitution and state law.

2500|$|In 837 a {{fleet of}} sixty longships sailed up the River Liffey and raided [...] "churches, forts and dwellings", {{including}} presumably those at Dublin. Later in the same year, a certain Saxolb (Söxulfr), [...] "chief of the foreigners", was killed in Brega by the Uí Colgain, {{a branch of the}} Cíanachta Breg. The Chronicon Scotorum and the Annals of Clonmacnoise ascribe [...] "the first taking and possession of the Danes in Dublin" [...] <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> But this was only a foretaste of things to come. In 841 the Vikings returned to Dublin, this time not as raiders but as conquerors. They seized the ecclesiastical settlement at Duiblinn and established a longphort, or naval encampment, nearby; where precisely is still a matter of debate, but the present site of Dublin Castle is a likely candidate, as it overlooked the Black Pool (Duiblinn, from which the city of Dublin takes its name), which would have served as a natural harbour. Four years later the Annals of Ulster refer also to foreigners at Áth Cliath; this may simply be a loose reference to the settlement at Duiblinn, but {{it is possible that the}} native settlement of Áth Cliath was also seized and a second longphort established on the Liffey – possibly at Usher's Island. These settlements were temporary wintering camps (...) and probably amounted to little more than pirate bases. From their new base in Dublin, the Vikings plundered many territories in Leinster and the Midlands as far as the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Many more raids were to follow. In 845 the Vikings of Dublin plundered Dún Masc (Rock of Dunamase in County Laois), killing the abbot of Tír dá Glas (Terryglass in County Tipperary) and other dignitaries; other ecclesiastical settlements plundered in the same year included Kildare, Clonenagh, Kinnitty (County Offaly), Killeigh, Kells, Monasterboice, Duleek, Swords and Finglas. In 845 they also set up an encampment near Tullamore.|$|E

60|$|Up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> Mowgli {{had always}} delighted in {{the turn of}} the seasons. It was he who {{generally}} saw the first Eye-of-the-Spring deep down among the grasses, and the first bank of spring clouds, which are like nothing else in the Jungle. His voice could be heard in all sorts of wet, star-lighted, blossoming places, helping the big frogs through their choruses, or mocking the little upside-down owls that hoot through the white nights. Like all his people, spring was the season he chose for his flittings--moving, for the mere joy of rushing through the warm air, thirty, forty, or fifty miles between twilight and the morning star, and coming back panting and laughing and wreathed with strange flowers. The Four did not follow him on these wild ringings of the Jungle, but went off to sing songs with other wolves. The Jungle People are very busy in the spring, and Mowgli could hear them grunting and screaming and whistling according to their kind. Their voices then are different from their voices at other times of the year, {{and that is one of}} the reasons why spring in the Jungle is called the Time of New Talk.|$|E
