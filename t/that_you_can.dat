5|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in two months}} while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, Happiness... Is Not a Fish <b>That</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Catch, which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting {{at the time and}} lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of The Age of Spiritual Machines in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. Unlike their previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and less obvious layering and electronic texturing.|$|E

25|$|The name Selenium {{comes from}} a joke made by Huggins in an email, mocking a {{competitor}} named Mercury, saying <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> cure mercury poisoning by taking selenium supplements. The others that received the email took the name and ran with it.|$|E

25|$|The Principia Discordia, if read literally, {{encourages}} {{the worship of}} Eris, a.k.a. Discordia, the Goddess of chaos, or archetypes and or ideals associated with her. The Principia Discordia holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) {{and the notion that}} both are mere illusions. It is only by rejecting these principles <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> truly perceive reality.|$|E

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

25|$|The Resident Evil Shot Blaster is a {{replacement}} to the Wii Zapper. The gun {{comes with a}} detachable Nunchuk holster. The holster also rotates downward to allow easy reloading for in the game. When the nunchuk holster is removed the gun becomes something like a pistol.

25|$|There {{are many}} species of plants that reside within the {{preserve}} besides the iconic Valley Oak(Quercus lobata).

Other plants <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find on the preserve include Wild California Grape (Vitis californica), California Rose (Rosa californica), and the Elderberry tree (Adoxaceae Sambucus). Two greatly invasive plant species that occur around the Cosumnes River Preserve are the Perennial Pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) and Common water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E

25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E
25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, which looked like the human interface in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the command button space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much. The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E
