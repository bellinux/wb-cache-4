40|$|To avoid {{problems}} related to the discharge of sulfidic spent caustics, a biotechnological process is developed for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol. The process operates at natron-alkaline conditions (> 1 mol L- 1 of sodium- and potassium carbonates and a pH of 8. 5 – 10) to enable the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> with a high partial CO 2 pressure. In the process, methanethiol reacts with biologically produced sulfur particles to form a complex mixture predominantly consisting of inorganic polysulfides, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The effect of these organic sulfur compounds on the biological oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur was studied with natron-alkaliphilic bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Biological oxidation rates were reduced by 50 % at 0. 05 mM methanethiol, while for DMDS and DMTS, this was estimated to occur at 1. 5 and 1. 0 mM, respectively. The inhibiting effect of methanethiol on biological sulfide oxidation diminished due to its reaction with biologically produced sulfur particles. This reaction increases the feasibility of biotechnological <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol at natron-alkaline condition...|$|E

DMS removal efficiency in the integrated system {{was up to}} 96 %. Bacterial communities in the BTF were assessed by PCR–DGGE, which play the dominant role in the biological processes of metabolism, sulfur oxidation, sulfate-reducing and carbon oxidation. The addition of ozone from NTP made microbial community in BTF more complicated and active for DMS removal. The NTP oxidize DMS to simple compounds such as methanol and carbonyl sulfide; the intermediate organic products and DMS are further oxidized to sulfate, carbon dioxide, water vapors by biological degradation. These results show that NTP–BTF is achievable and open new possibilities for applying the integrated with NTP and BTF to odour gas treatment...|$|E

40|$|In this {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} second edition of an established text Tony Guénault provides {{a clear and}} refreshingly readable introduction to statistical physics, {{an essential component of}} any first degree in physics. The treatment itself is self-contained and concentrates on an understanding of the physical ideas, without requiring a high level of mathematical sophistication. A straightforward quantum approach to statistical averaging is adopted from the outset (easier, the author believes, than the classical approach). The initial part of the book is geared towards explaining the equilibrium properties of a simple isolated assembly of particles. Thus, several important topics, for example an ideal spin-½ solid, can be discussed at an early stage.

40|$|Biofiltration is all {{effective}} {{technology for}} the treatment of-gaseous waste. However, a biofiltration system needs a bioreactor of large volume and it is slow to adapt to fluctuating concentrations in waste gas. To overcome these disadvantages. a bench-scale system integrating a biofilter and an adsorption unit for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> containing o-xylene was investigated in this study. The adsorption unit was packed with granule active carbon (GAC). The results showed that 90 % of o-xylene could be removed in the biofilter at,tit inlet concentration Mow 900 mg/m(3) The maximum elimination capacity was 80 g/m(3) h when the o-xylene loading rate was less than 100 g/m(3) h. High o-xylene concentration in inlet gas resulted in all overload of the biofilter. Using the adsorption unit. the outlet concentration of o-xylene could be reduced significantly. The surface properties of GAC and the factors affecting the adsorption performance were investigated, and GAC regeneration method was also evaluated. The combination of adsorption and microbial processes not only led to a high and stable efficiency of o-xylene removal. but also improved the capacity of resisting the shock loads.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{technologies}} {{exist for the}} treatment of malodorous air streams, including adsorption, absorption, catalytic combustion, biofiltration and bioscrubbing. Conventional packed bed biofiltration of malodorous substances from waste gas streams has the disadvantages of large unit surface area and relatively uncontrolled design principles. The large bed surface area leads to difficulties in maintaining even moisture and temperature profiles. In addition, the control of such biologically important parameters as pH is difficult. Novel fluidized/spouted beds were studied for biological <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> because of their high specific gas flowrate and vigorous mixing which facilitates enhanced gas–biomass contact. Trials of a range of fluidized and spouted beds, with gas loadings of up to 14000 m 3 -gas m− 2 -bed h− 1, were carried out on various biofilm support media including glass ballotini, rice hulls, plastic discs and granules, silica gel, molecular sieves, vermiculite, perlite, activated carbon, cork, polystyrene and expanded clay. Severe aggregation and wall adhesion restricted the operational range of the reactors. Particle suitability was based on a combination of shape, density, size, porosity and wettability, with large, heavy clay particles performing best.

ALEGRA is a 3 -DALE code that has been developed at Sandia National Laboratories over the past few years. ALEGRA has been applied to a 2 -D simulation of presplitting using decoupled explosives in rock blasting with very interesting results. The detonation of the explosive at the bottom of the hole sends a shock wave up the borehole driven by the explosive gas expanding into air. The explosive gas compresses the air against the stemming column where it rebounds and recompresses at the bottom of the borehole. This type of ringing takes several cycles to damp out. The explosively induced expansion of the borehole is also treated by ALEGRA as well as the shock wave imparted to the rock.

40|$|Biofiltration is an {{efficient}} technology {{for treatment of}} gaseous waste. Its disadvantages, however, include large volume of bioreactor and slow adaptation to fluctuating concentrations in waste gas. Catalytic oxidation offers a high destructive efficiency at relatively low operating temperature and small unit. A bench scale system integrated with a biofilter and a catalytic oxidation unit for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> containing o-xylene was investigated in this study. The catalytic oxidation unit was packed with Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The results showed that 90 % of o-xylene could be removed in the biofilter at the load below 38. 2 g m(- 3) h(- 1). High o-xylene concentration in inlet gas resulted in an overload of the biofilter. Using the Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalytic oxidation unit, the concentration of o-xylene could be reduced evidently. The combination of the chemical and microbial processes not only led to a high and stable efficiency of o-xylene conversion, but also improved capacity resisting the shock loads. The Cu/Al 2 O 3 was studied for o-xylene oxidation in temperature range of 90 - 320 degrees C. The o-xylene conversion was improved correspondingly with the increasing of oxidation temperature. The reaction mechanism of o-xylene oxidation on Cu/Al 2 O 3 was also investigated using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in radiative heat transfer modeling with respect to treatment of nongray radiation from both gas species and soot particles, while radiation modeling in turbulent ame simulations is still in its infancy. Aiming at reducing this gap, this paper introduces sophisticated models of soot and gas-phase radiation to turbulent ame simulations. The full-spectrum k-distribution method is implemented into a three-dimensional unstructured CFD code for nongray radiation modeling. The mixture full-spectrum k-distributions including nongray absorbing soot particles are constructed from a narrow-band k-distribution database created for individual gas-phase species, and an efcient scheme is employed for the construction in complex CFD simulations. A detailed reaction mechanism including NOx and soot kinetics is used to predict ame structure. A detailed soot model with method of moments is employed to determine soot particle size distributions. An oxygen-enriched, turbulent, nonpremixed jet ame is simulated, which features large concentrations of gas-phase radiating species and soot particles. Nongray soot modeling is shown to be of greater importance than nongray gas modeling in sooty ame simulations, with gray soot models producing large errors. The nongray treatment of soot strongly inuences ame temperatures in the upstream and the ame tip region and is essential for accurate predictions of NO formation in sooty ames. The nongray <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases,</b> however, weakly inuences upstream ame temperatures and, therefore, has only a small effect on NOx predictions. The effect of nongray soot radiation on ame temperature is also substantial in downstream regions where the soot concentration is small...|$|E

40|$|Biofiltration is {{cost-effective}} for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> containing low {{concentrations of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (< 3 g m(- 3)). However, conventional biofilters, based on compost and bacterial activity, face problems with the elimination of hydrophobic compounds. Besides that, biofilter operational stability is often hampered by acidification and drying out of the filter bed. To overcome these problems, biofilters with fungi on inert packing material have been developed. Fungi are more resistant to acid and dry conditions than bacteria, and it is hypothesised that the aerial mycelia of fungi, which are {{in direct contact with}} the gas, can take up hydrophobic compounds faster than flat aqueous bacterial biofilm surfaces. Alpha-pinene was chosen as a model compound. It is an odorous compound emitted by the wood processing industry. In 21 biofilter columns four different packing materials were tested: perlite, expanded clay granules, polyurethane foam cubes and compost. The filters were inoculated with forest soil and ventilated with gas containing alpha-pinene. Start up took 1 - 2 months and removal efficiencies of more than 90 % were observed, but mostly ranged from 50 % to 90 % due to overloading. In the filters containing perlite, clay, polyurethane and compost volumetric removal capacities of, respectively, 24, 33, 38 and 24 g alpha-pinene m(- 3) filter bed h(- 1) were attained and the gas pressure drops in the 60 cm high filter beds measured at a superficial gas velocity of 35 m h(- 1) were 70, 550, 180 and 250 Pa. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} develop biofilters based on the action of fungi with higher elimination capacities for alpha-pinene as reported in literature for bacterial biofilters. The use of polyurethane foam cubes is preferred because of the low gas pressure drop in combination with a high volumetric elimination capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
