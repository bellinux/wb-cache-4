5000|$|Lanigan-Schmidt's artwork {{incorporates}} {{materials such}} as <b>tinsel,</b> <b>foil,</b> cellophane, saran wrap and glitter, embracing kitsch and intentionally tacky. His work {{has been compared to}} that of Florine Stettheimer, who used cellophane in her sets for the Gertrude Stein/Virgil Thomson opera Four Saints in Three Acts; his art was included in an exhibit of artists influenced by Stettheimer.His work has also been likened to the religious-themed tinfoil-covered thrones of art brut artist James Hampton.He is sometimes grouped with the Pattern and Decoration art movement, though he says that is [...] "retrospective craziness".His art is noted for its incorporation of Catholic iconography.|$|E
6000|$|... 16. Again. Out of the nacre of any mussel or {{oyster shell}} you might cut, at your pleasure, any {{quantity}} of small flat circular disks of the prettiest color and luster. To some extent, such <b>tinsel</b> or <b>foil</b> of shell is used pleasantly for decoration. But the mussel or oyster becoming itself an unwilling modeler, agglutinates its juice into three dimensions, {{and the fact}} of the surface being now geometrically gradated, together with the savage instinct of attributing value to what is difficult to obtain, make the little boss so precious in men's sight, that wise eagerness of search for the kingdom of heaven can be likened to their eagerness of search for it; and the gates of Paradise can be no otherwise rendered so fair to their poor intelligence, as by telling them that every gate was of [...] "one pearl." ...|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, parols have a star-shaped {{framework}} made {{of bamboo}} sticks {{which are then}} covered by coloured pieces of either Japanese paper or crÃªpe paper. The most common form is a five-pointed star with two decorative [...] "tails".Nowadays, the materials range from plastic, shells, glass, beads, foil, feathers, hemp, leaves, seeds, soft drink straws, wood and even metal. They usually come in various sizes, from small, <b>tinsel</b> and <b>foil</b> lanterns to gigantic ones that are electrically lit at night, and may have one, three or more tails aside from the ubiquitous two. Some have a surrounding [...] "halo," [...] {{and the number of}} points on the star usually ranges from four to around ten (however, higher numbers exist). As for stellate patterns, more complex shapes that are seen are the rose, the bromeliad, the snowflake and the sea urchin.|$|R
