2500|$|These section 24(1) {{remedies}} {{may only}} be dispensed by a [...] "court of competent jurisdiction". In R. v. Rahey (1987), {{it was found that}} in any case, provincial superior and appellate courts, and courts created by the federal government, will qualify as a court of competent jurisdiction and may award remedies where it is considered [...] "appropriate and just".

2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a <b>trial</b> <b>procedure</b> can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts {{to be sure that the}} disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E

50|$|Santobello v. New York {{added that}} when plea bargains are broken, {{remedies}} exist; {{and it has}} been argued that given the prevalence of plea agreements, the most important rights of the accused may be found in the law of contracts rather than the law of <b>trial</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} the <b>trial</b> <b>procedure,</b> an adult accused has the option to give a sworn evidence, unsworn evidence, or remain silent. The Child Act does not provide for any right to remain silent. Section 90(9) merely allows the child to give sworn or unsworn evidence.|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} of this <b>trial</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{interrogating}} the 'dāsi', the maid, of the accused female member. If a Nambutiri housewife (antharjanam's) was suspected of sexual misconduct then she was at first placed under restraint, and as a first step, her dāsi, a.k.a. vṛṣali, was questioned. If the dāsi should incriminate her mistress the latter is forthwith segregated and a watch set upon her.|$|E

50|$|Eymerich {{appears to}} have been {{familiar}} with Bernard Gui's earlier Liber sententiarum and other inquisitorial treatises. The Directorium Inquisitorum includes definitions of various types of heresies, discussion of questions of jurisdiction, and proper <b>trial</b> <b>procedure.</b> The book was used as a manual for inquisitors, and gave practical advice on how to conduct inquiries. It also described various means an accused heretic might use to dissemble, such as equivocation or the pretense of insanity.|$|E

50|$|Corruption remains {{pervasive}} and governmental human rights bodies are generally ineffective.
