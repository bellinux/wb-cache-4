5|$|This feat was {{popularly known}} as {{splitting}} the atom. For this accomplishment, Cockcroft and Walton were awarded the Hughes Medal in 1938, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951. They went on <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> carbon, nitrogen and oxygen using protons, deuterons and alpha particles. They demonstrated that they had produced radioactive isotopes, including carbon-11 and nitrogen-13.|$|E
5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate.</b> Headon {{was asked}} to leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming. Chimes was brought back to drum {{for the next few}} months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it. To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E

5000|$|The mine can {{be fitted}} with anti-handling devices, {{it has two}} {{secondary}} fuze wells, one in the base, one in the side. The mine's case is prone <b>to</b> <b>disintegrating</b> in hot dry conditions, which can expose the bare fuzes reducing the activation pressure of the mine. The mine is found in Jordan, Nicaragua, and Somalia.|$|R
40|$|Degradation of {{propionate}} and butyrate {{in whole}} and disintegrated granules from a thermophilic (55 degrees C) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with acetate, propionate, and butyrate as substrates was examined. The propionate and butyrate degradation rates in whole granules were 1. 16 and 4. 0 mumol/min/g of volatile solids, respectively, and the rates decreased 35 and 25 %, respectively, after {{disintegration of the}} granules. The effect of adding different hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (both sulfate reducers and methanogens), some of which used formate in addition <b>to</b> hydrogen, <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated</b> granules was tested. Addition of either Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, a hydrogen-utilizing methanogen that does not use formate, or Methanobacterium sp. strain CB 12, a hydrogen- and formate-utilizing methanogen, <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated</b> granules increased the degradation rate of both propionate and butyrate. Furthermore, addition of a thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium (a Desulfotomaculum sp. isolated in our laboratory) <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated</b> granules improved the degradation of both substrates {{even more than the}} addition of methanogens. By monitoring the hydrogen partial pressure in the cultures, a correlation between the hydrogen partial pressure and the degradation rate of propionate and butyrate was observed, showing a decrease in the degradation rate with increased hydrogen partial pressure. No significant differences in the stimulation of the degradation rates were observed when the disintegrated granules were supplied with methanogens that utilized hydrogen only or hydrogen and formate. This indicated that interspecies formate transfer was not important for stimulation of propionate and butyrate degradation...|$|R
5|$|Burma in the 15th {{century was}} divided into four {{principal}} power centers: the Ava Kingdom in present-day central Burma, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the southern coast, the Mrauk-U Kingdom (Arakan) in the west, and various Shan States {{in the east and}} the north. Beginning in the 1480s, Ava began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> into even smaller kingdoms. By the early 15th century, Ava's former vassals—Mohnyin (and its allies Confederation of Shan States) in the north and the Prome Kingdom (Pyay) in the south—were regularly raiding their former overlord's territory with increasing frequency and intensity.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate,</b> and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib had collapsed, and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E
5|$|In 1219, in {{retaliation}} for the murders of his ambassadors, the Mongol Khan, Genghis Khan, invaded the Khwarezmian Empire. In a campaign that lasted three years, Genghis Khan and his generals destroyed the Khwarezmian armies and caused the empire <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate.</b> The Khwarezmian Sultan Ala ad-Din Muhammad succumbed to disease on an island in the Caspian Sea, leaving his son, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu landless.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the skaven army is close <b>to</b> <b>disintegrating,</b> with their ranks {{decimated}} by plague and their supplies being devoured by Grottle's unstoppable rats. Thanquol decides {{that they must}} attack immediately. Meanwhile, Heskit, Vilebroth, and Grottle are planning revenge on Thanquol for sabotaging their schemes. At first they demand that Lurk assassinate Thanquol, but Lurk, thinking desperately, suggests that they use Thanquol's own trick on him, and tip off Gotrek and Felix. They approve.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study a new {{classification}} method {{for the assessment of}} ease of excavation of rock masses is proposed, based on the Geological Strength Index and the point load strength of the intact rock. The data originate from excavation sites in Greece in sedimentary and metamorphic rock masses. A wide variety of rock structures were considered, ranging from blocky <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated,</b> and different excavation methods have been used (blasting, hydraulic breaking, ripping and digging). The proposed method cannot be applied to heterogeneous rock masses and soft rocks/hard soils. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
5|$|Levels contain many {{different}} environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At {{the end of}} most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April, the 2nd Hydroplane Command at Divulje began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate,</b> {{with some}} pilots flying their {{aircraft}} to the Bay of Kotor {{to join the}} 3rd Hydroplane Command. One Do 22 attacked an Italian tanker off Bari, claiming a near miss that the Yugoslav crew believed to have caused some damage. The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near Šibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April, under {{pressure}} from the 14th Panzer Division, remnants of the 4th Army continued to withdraw towards Sarajevo via Jajce and Travnik. The cadet battalion at Ključ managed to briefly delay the German advance through Mrkonjić Grad, but were overcome by tanks and air attacks. The bridge at Jajce was demolished at 23:15, and Nedeljković withdrew his headquarters to Travnik. The remaining units of the 4th Army continued <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate.</b> The vanguard of the northern column of 14th Panzer Division surged forward to Teslić, with the central column only reaching Jajce.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the band}} was trying to {{maintain}} their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound gave the album an experimental feel, causing critics to attack their musical integrity. According to John Densmore in his biography Riders On The Storm individual writing credits were noted {{for the first time}} because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Robby Krieger's song [...] "Tell All the People". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close <b>to</b> <b>disintegrating.</b> Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album.|$|R
50|$|Rice absorbs a {{great deal}} of water as it cooks, {{expanding}} its volume and using up the cooking water. The moisture and heat gelatinize and soften the starch granules in the rice. The cooking time for raw rice (not parboiled beforehand) ranges from about 15 minutes and up, depending upon the type and freshness of rice, method, and desired result (from separate grains <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated</b> porridge). Some rices, such as white rice, long-grain rice and African rice, break up more easily. Some cooking methods are more likely to break the rice (fragmenting it with a mortar and pestle before cooking, or stirring frequently). Some rice is stickier. Most recipes will therefore not work for all rices.|$|R
5|$|Serbia started <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> {{after the}} death of Stefan Dušan. According to Matteo Villani, an {{unidentified}} Serbian lord sought Hungarian assistance against his more powerful (and also unnamed) enemy in the late 1350s. Historians John V. A. Fine and Pál Engel write that the Serbian lord {{was a member of the}} Rastislalić family; Gyula Kristó and Iván Bertényi identify him as Lazar Hrebeljanović. Royal charters of 1358 show that Hungarian troops fought in Serbia in October 1358. The next summer Louis also marched to Serbia, but Stefan Uroš V of Serbia avoided battle.|$|E
5|$|The Mura {{sector was}} quiet on 9 April. The 42nd Infantry Division Murska took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but the 105th Infantry Regiment and 341st Reserve Regiment began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> due to desertions. Due to the {{situation}} on the right flank of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki to withdraw from the Drava to behind the Bednja to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbrian hegemony over Northern Britain, won by Ecgfrith's predecessors, {{had begun}} <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate.</b> Several of Northumbria's subject nations had rebelled in recent years, {{leading to a}} number of {{large-scale}} battles against the Picts, Mercians, and Irish, with varied success. Following sieges on neighbouring territories carried out by the Picts, Ecgfrith led his forces against them, despite advice to the contrary, in an effort to reassert his suzerainty over the Pictish nations.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> after death. Only the {{ossicles}} and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal and begin <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of}} the eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki, the far left formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrate</b> during the night of 10/11 April.|$|E

50|$|He then {{discusses}} {{the history of}} the public sphere starting with medieval times and determines that there was no clear separation between the public and private realms, only public representation of power. The medieval representation of the public sphere was linked to the concrete existence of a ruler, for example he referred to the princely seal as a symbol of sovereignty that was considered public. Feudal authorities including church, princes, and nobility began <b>to</b> <b>disintegrated</b> during a long process of polarization and a bourgeois sphere separate from the state came into existence. “Public no longer referred to the “representative” court of a prince endowed with authority, but rather to an institution regulated according to competence, to an apparatus endowed with a monopoly on the legal exertion of authority".|$|R
