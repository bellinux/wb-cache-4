Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make <b>them</b> <b>your</b> own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice". When assembling the cut for [...] "Deep Down", Patton was able {{to get in touch with}} the original vocalist, a woman named Christy, though mutual friend Daniele Luppi.

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play <b>them</b> <b>your</b> songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed <b>them</b> <b>your</b> lyrics and sang a little bit {{and the next thing you}} knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea for the first time on any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you {{to come out and}} play <b>them</b> <b>your</b> songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
2500|$|John Maynard Keynes said of it: [...] "In {{my opinion}} it {{is a grand}} book...Morally and philosophically I find myself in {{agreement}} with virtually the whole of it: and not only in agreement with it, but in deeply moved agreement." [...] However, Keynes did not think Hayek's philosophy was of practical use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: [...] "What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion {{with the results of}} your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of <b>them.</b> <b>Your</b> greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to its themes such {{as young}} women seeking {{independence}} in a [...] "man's world", [...] "gender-bending" [...] and [...] "same-sex attraction" [...] (albeit in a roundabout way), {{there have been}} a number of re-workings for the stage, particularly in musical theatre, among <b>them</b> <b>Your</b> Own Thing (1968), Music Is (1977), All Shook Up (2005), and Play On! (1997), the last two jukebox musicals featuring the music of Elvis Presley and Duke Ellington, respectively. Another adaptation is Illyria, by composer Pete Mills. Theatre Grottesco created a modern version of the play from the point of view of the servants working for Duke Orsino and Lady Olivia. The adaptation takes a much deeper look at the issues of classism, and society without leadership. In 1999, the play was adapted as Epiphany by the Takarazuka Revue, adding more overt commentary on the role of theatre and actors, as well as gender as applied to the stage (made more layered by the fact that all roles in this production were played by women).|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Tarfon, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Jose the Galilean were {{reclining}} at a meal in {{the house}} of Aris in Lydda when the question was presented to them of which is more important, learning or action. Rabbi Tarfon said action, Rabbi Akiva said learning, and then all responded that learning is more important, for learning brings about action. Rabbi Jose the Galilean argued that learning is more important, for the religious duty to learn the Torah came before the religious duty to separate dough–offering by 40 years, the obligation to separate tithes by 44 years, the obligation of the years of release by 61 years, and the obligation of the Jubilee Year by 103 years. And the Sifre taught that just as a more severe penalty pertains to neglect of learning than to neglect of doing required deeds, so a more abundant reward attaches to learning than to the doing of required deeds, for [...] says, “And you shall teach <b>them</b> <b>your</b> children, talking of them,” and [...] follows immediately, saying, “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed <b>them</b> <b>your</b> lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] "And on {{the seventh}} day God {{finished}} his work," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God created seven dedications (for the creation {{of each of the}} seven days). God expressed six of them, and reserved one for future generations. Thus, when God created the first day and finished all God's work on it, God dedicated it, as [...] says, [...] "And it was evening, and it was morning, one day." [...] When God created the second day and finished all God's work in it, God dedicated it, as [...] says, [...] "And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day." [...] Similar language appears through the six days of creation. God created the seventh day, but not for work, because Genesis does not say in connecti{{on the seventh}} day, [...] "And it was evening and it was morning." [...] That is because God reserved the dedication of the seventh day for the generations to come, as [...] says, speaking of the Sabbath, [...] "And there shall be one day which is known to the Lord; not day, and not night." [...] The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer compared this to a man who had precious utensils {{that he did not want}} to leave as an inheritance to anyone but to his son. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that it is likewise with God. God did not want to give the day of blessing and holiness that was before God as an inheritance to anyone but Israel. For when the Israelites left Egypt, before God gave them the Torah, God gave them the Sabbath as an inheritance (as reported in [...] ). Before God gave Israel the Torah, they kept two Sabbaths, as [...] says first, [...] "And You made known to <b>them</b> <b>Your</b> holy Sabbath." [...] And only afterwards did God give them the Torah, as [...] says as it continues, [...] "And commanded them commandments, and statutes, and Torah by the hand of Moses, Your servant." [...] God observed and sanctified the Sabbath, and Israel is obliged only to observe and sanctify the Sabbath. For when God gave the Israelites manna, all through the 40 years in the wilderness, God gave it during on the six days during which God had created the world, Sunday through Friday, but on the Sabbath, God did not give them manna. Of course, God had power enough to give them manna every day. But the Sabbath was before God, so God gave the Israelites bread for two days on Friday, as [...] says, [...] "See, for the Lord has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days." [...] When the people saw that God observed the Sabbath, they also rested, as [...] says, [...] "So the people rested on the seventh day." [...] Reading [...] "And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God blessed and hallowed the Sabbath day, and Israel is bound only to keep and to hallow the Sabbath day. Hence the Sages said that those who says the benediction and sanctification over the wine on Friday evenings will have their days increased in this world, and in the world to come. For [...] says, [...] "For by me your days shall be multiplied," [...] signifying in this world. And [...] continues, [...] "and the years of your life shall be increased," [...] signifying in the world to come.|$|E
