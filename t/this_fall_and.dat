[...] An Associated Press feature on Westfall in mid-November noted:"Football fans in record numbers are paying their way to see Michigan's Tom Harmon playing his last season, but many of them are coming away from games with the question, 'Who's that guy, Westfall?' Outside the focus of the publicity spotlight, Bullet Bob Westfall, a stocky 180-pound fullback, has matched All-America Tommy almost yard for yard by rushing <b>this</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> in at least three games has stolen the show from his illustrious teammate." ...|$|E

Harvard {{was one of}} {{the elite}} teams {{in the early days of}} college football, winning three national championships in the 1890s, and the match between great squads from the east and west was widely anticipated. Before game, The World of New York wrote:"The football team of the University of Michigan, reputed to be the strongest eleven in the West, is now quartered at Auburndale awaiting tomorrow's game with Harvard on Soldier's [...] Field. Nineteen men have come East on the team. Their line is very evenly balanced, and Bob Wrenn has written to Cambridge that the Michigan quarter-back is the best in the business. They have a long string of victories to their credit <b>this</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> Harvard will have to play football to score. There is absolutely no way of judging the relative merits of the teams, so the veil of doubt will add to the interest of the game." ...|$|E
