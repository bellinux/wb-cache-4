40|$|Two {{parachute}} fabrics, {{described by}} Parachute Industry Specifications PIA-C- 7020 D Type I and PIA-C- 44378 D Type I, were tested to obtain their permeabilities in air (i. e., flow-through volume of air per area per time) {{over the range}} of differential pressures from 0. 146 psf (7 Pa) to 25 psf (1197 Pa). Both fabrics met their specification permeabilities at the standard differential pressure of 0. 5 inch of water (2. 60 psf, 124 Pa).

In some carbonates, for example, the tests of microscopic organisms can become calcified to create significant isolated intra-particular pore space {{which is not}} connected to the inter-particular pore space available for hydrocarbon storage and flow. In such cases, core analysis will only record the inter-particular pore space, or “effective porosity”, whereas the density and neutron logs will record the total pore space.

The greatest variations were recorded in the coarse and fine-grained marbles with straight grain boundaries.

In the case of water absorption through capillarity, the samples that suffer a higher increase are those characterised by a bimodal pore size distribution, even if they possess low Hg-porosity.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of estimating concrete or mortar strength {{by measuring the}} <b>total</b> water <b>porosity</b> by a very simple method is investigated.

However, a very promising correlation (correlation coefficient R> 93 %) is obtained if the 'calculated average paste porosity' Pp is substituted for the measured <b>total</b> water <b>porosity</b> of the mix Pm.
