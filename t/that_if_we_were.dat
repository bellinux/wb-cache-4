Apologists explain that Jews may have been praying for and not necessarily to the aspects of Godliness represented by the sephirot.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Hubble [...] "{{constant}}" [...] is {{a constant}} only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates {{the value of the}} Hubble constant today. Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating (see Accelerating universe), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to look at some fixed distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.|$|E

Stuart dispatched a force of about 3,000 cavalrymen to intercept Sheridan's cavalry, which was more than three times their numbers. As he rode in pursuit, accompanied by his aide, Maj. Andrew R. Venable, they were able to stop briefly along the way to be greeted by Stuart's wife, Flora, and his children, Jimmie and Virginia.

2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E

2500|$|Recollecting the Nez Perce {{encounter}} with the Lewis and Clark party, in 1889 anthropologist Alice Fletcher wrote that [...] "the Lewis and Clark explorers were the first white men {{that many of the}} people had ever seen and the women thought them beautiful." [...] She wrote that the Nez Perce [...] "were kind to the tired and hungry party. They furnished fresh horses and dried meat and fish with wild potatoes and other roots which were good to eat, and the refreshed white men went further on, westward, leaving their bony, wornout horses for the Indians to take care of and have fat and strong when Lewis and Clark should come back on their way home." [...] On their return trip they arrived at the Nez Perce encampment the following spring, again hungry and exhausted. [...] The tribe constructed a large tent for them and again fed them. [...] Desiring fresh red meat, the party offered an exchange for a Nez Perce horse. [...] Quoting from the Lewis and Clark diary, Fletcher writes, [...] "The hospitality of the Chiefs was offended at the idea of an exchange. He observed that his people had an abundance of young horses and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> disposed to use that food, we might have as many as we wanted." [...] The party stayed with the Nez Perce for a month before moving on.|$|E
2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside." [...] Shanahan had played just four pre-season games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils' last pre-season goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.|$|E
2500|$|On {{composing}} for a {{film with}} such a large cast, Silvestri said, [...] "I’ve worked on films where {{there have been a}} number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world ... the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, [...] "We knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that." [...] Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable [...] "Avengers" [...] theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be [...] "generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... the interesting thing about it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from the idea of it being an action moment." [...] Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a motif for Loki as the central villain of the film, a [...] "low, ominous sequence of chords, [...] when his presence is either visible or implied"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character [...] "makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully" [...] as [...] "a little of his theme goes a long, long way", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the Black Widow and [...] "wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her", so Silvestri introduced [...] "a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor" [...] to define the character. For the other major characters, Silvestri used instrumentation to differentiate their scenes, for instance Iron Man [...] "always has the more contemporary, rhythmic component to a lot of his music." ...|$|E
