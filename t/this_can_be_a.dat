5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} {{a highlight of}} the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
30|$|In some countries, it is {{not common}} that {{students}} have <b>a</b> credit card. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> obstacle for using public cloud infrastructure services for student projects.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{there is}} the extreme close up shot which has one body part usually. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> eye, a hand or {{anything}} else. These shots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used {{with any of the}} aforementioned camera angles.|$|R
500|$|Nomen dubium (Latin for [...] "dubious name"): A name {{describing}} a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. <b>As</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extremely subjective and controversial designation (see Hadrosaurus), this term {{is not used}} on this list.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> valid way of forecasting the weather {{when it is}} in a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> result of a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{malformation}} of the ossicles. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> isolated phenomenon or {{can occur}} {{as part of}} a syndrome where development of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches is seen such as in Goldenhar syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, branchio-oto-renal syndrome etc.|$|R
25|$|Subsets with <b>a</b> maximum (that <b>is,</b> subsets {{which are}} bounded by themselves); <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{isolated}} point or a limit {{point of the}} whole set; {{in the latter case}} {{it may or may not}} <b>be</b> also <b>a</b> limit point of the subset.|$|R
50|$|If <b>a</b> stereo signal <b>is</b> to be {{reproduced}} in mono, out-of-phase {{parts of the}} signal will cancel, which may cause the unwanted reduction or loss of {{some parts of the}} signal. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important factor in choosing which technique to use.|$|R
25|$|A switch is {{operated}} manually, perhaps after security checks. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{push button switch}} or a swipe card.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> concern {{when using}} shared {{keyboards}}; the keyboards {{can serve as}} vectors for pathogens that cause the cold, flu, and other communicable diseases easily spread by indirect contact.|$|E
25|$|Inadequate {{cleaning}} of the operculum space allows stagnation of bacteria and any accumulated debris. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> result of poor access due to limited {{room in the}} case of the 3rd molars.|$|E
30|$|It {{is easy to}} {{see that}} <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{effective}} measure if we consider an infinite fuzzy set. But the problem in working with such <b>a</b> measure <b>is</b> that it gives importance to the sup operation only. The work in <b>this</b> regard <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in [11].|$|R
50|$|Experience affects adult {{learning}} - Adults have more experience than adolescents. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> asset and a liability, if prior knowledge is inaccurate, incomplete, or naive, it {{can interfere with}} or distort the integration of incoming information (Clement, 1982; National Research Council, 2000).|$|R
50|$|Absorption {{of calcium}} salts {{normally}} occurs in bony tissues and is facilitated by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. However, increased amounts of parathyroid hormone {{in the blood}} result in the deposit of calcium in soft tissues. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indication of hyperparathyroidism, arteriosclerosis, or trauma to tissues.|$|R
25|$|Sand that {{is blown}} {{by the wind}} inland to form sand dunes usually develop on shorelines where there is {{suitably}} strong winds. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major sink for the sediment budget of a shoreline.|$|E
25|$|If a {{horse is}} {{severely}} dyspnoeic (that is, struggling to breathe), {{the most important}} measure to take is to remove it from the stable or barn into fresh air. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> life-saving measure in an acute attack.|$|E
25|$|RMP colours {{the urine}} and all bodily {{secretions}} (tears, sweat, etc.) an orange-pink colour and <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> useful proxy if urine testing {{is not available}} (although this colour fades approximately six to eight hours after each dose).|$|E
30|$|The {{nutrient}} {{content of the}} vermicomposts revealed khat to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suitable substrate for vermicomposting thereby making efficient utilization of solid wastes. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective technology to reduce the solid waste and the resultant product <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for improving soil fertility and crop production by the farmers.|$|R
25|$|When {{there are}} many small or weak studies of an intervention, <b>a</b> {{statistical}} meta-analysis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to co-ordinate the studies' results and to draw a stronger conclusion about {{the outcome of the}} treatment. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important contribution to the establishment of a foundation of evidence about an intervention.|$|R
50|$|A {{more subtle}} {{advantage}} is that by storing a tag {{in the same place}} as the pointer, it is often possible to guarantee the atomicity of an operation that updates both the pointer and its tag without external synchronization mechanisms. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extremely large performance gain, especially in operating systems.|$|R
25|$|Normally {{the first}} step in {{debugging}} is to attempt to reproduce the problem. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.|$|E
25|$|Prove {{whether the}} first player will win, lose or draw from the initial position, given perfect play on both sides. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> non-constructive proof (possibly {{involving}} a strategy-stealing argument) that need not actually determine any moves of the perfect play.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a foreign}} person {{requires}} access to USML items exported under a specific export authorization, but that foreign {{person is not}} authorized under the export authorization, the export authorization must be amended and re-approved by the U.S. Department of State. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> time-consuming process.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-eruption {{sediment}} may {{be picked}} up by a river channel surrounding the volcano that shows that the actual eruption may be imminent. [...] Most sediment is transported from volcanically disturbed watersheds during periods of heavy rainfall. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indication of morphological changes and increased hydrothermal activity in absence of instrumental monitoring techniques.|$|R
25|$|All {{phase-locked loops}} employ an {{oscillator}} element with variable frequency capability. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> analog VCO either driven by analog circuitry {{in the case}} of an APLL or driven digitally through the use of a digital-to-analog converter as is the case for some DPLL designs. Pure digital oscillators such as a numerically controlled oscillator are used in ADPLLs.|$|R
40|$|Examination of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract has {{traditionally}} been performed using endoscopy tools that allow a surgeon to see {{the inside of the}} lining of the digestive tract. Endoscopes are rigid or flexible tubes that use fibre-optics or cameras to visualise tissues in natural orifices. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> uncomfortable and very invasive procedure for the patient...|$|R
25|$|Most ester LAs are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while amide LAs are metabolized in the liver. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{factor in}} {{choosing}} an agent {{in patients with}} liver failure, although since cholinesterases are produced in the liver, physiologically (e.g. very young or very old individual) or pathologically (e.g. cirrhosis) impaired hepatic metabolism is also a consideration when using amides.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} spark {{characteristics are}} color, volume, {{nature of the}} spark, and length. Note that the length {{is dependent on the}} amount of pressure applied to the grinding wheel, so <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, the grinding wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up.|$|E
25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> preform <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pre-made {{shape of}} solder {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture the solder preform, stamping being the most common. The solder preform may include the solder flux needed for the soldering process. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> internal flux, inside the solder preform, or external, with the solder preform coated.|$|R
40|$|Identity-based {{encryption}} systems inherently {{exhibit the}} key escrow property. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> undesirable feature for certain applications and {{this paper presents}} some variants of existing systems (Boneh-Franklin's scheme) that successfully removes the key escrow property. The paper also shows one method by which the new scheme may <b>be</b> integrated into <b>a</b> hierarchical identity-based public key encryption system and a key-insulated system...|$|R
