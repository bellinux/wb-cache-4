50|$|<b>Topobiology</b> is Edelman’s theory which {{asserts that}} {{morphogenesis}} {{is driven by}} differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations and it explains how a single cell can {{give rise to a}} complex multi-cellular organism. As proposed by Edelman in 1988, <b>topobiology</b> is the process that sculpts and maintains differentiated tissues and is acquired by the energetically favored segregation of cells through heterologous cellular interactions.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} Edelman's {{technical}} books, The Mindful Brain (1978), develops {{his theory of}} Neural Darwinism, which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network {{in response to the}} environment. The second book, <b>Topobiology</b> (1988), proposes a theory of how the original neuronal network of a newborn's brain is established during development of the embryo. The Remembered Present (1990) contains an extended exposition of his theory of consciousness.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} murine and human {{microenvironment}} and {{hematopoietic stem cell}} niche {{in the context of}} intact bone marrow architecture in man and mouse, both in normal and in myelodysplastic syndrome marrow. We propose that the complexity of the hematopoietic stem cell niche can usefully be approached in the context of its <b>topobiology,</b> and we provide a model that incorporates in vitro and in vivo models as well as in situ findings from intact human marrow to explain the changes seen in myelodysplastic syndrome patients. We highlight the clinical application of the study of the bone marrow microenvironment and its <b>topobiology</b> in myelodysplastic syndromes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Topobiology</b> {{posits that}} {{morphogenesis}} {{is driven by}} differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations. This paradigm has been revised to include force-dependent molecular switches, cell and tissue tension, and reciprocal interactions with the microenvironment. It is now appreciated that tissue development is executed through conserved decision-making modules that operate on multiple length scales from the molecular and subcellular level through to the cell and tissue level and that these regulatory mechanisms specify cell and tissue fate by modifying the context of cellular signaling and gene expression. Here, we discuss the origin of these decision-making modules and illustrate how emergent properties of adhesion-directed multicellular structures sculpt the tissue, promote its functionality, and maintain its homeostasis through spatial segregation and organization of anchored proteins and secreted factors and through emergent properties of tissues, including tension fields and energy optimization...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{identification}} and characterization of various adhesion molecules (lymphocyte function associated antigen- 1, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1), chemotactic factors (interleukin- 8, monocyte chemotactic/activating factor), and their modulatory cytokines (gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor), {{it is possible to}} begin to ascribe specific molecules to cutaneous cellular reaction patterns. The abnormal <b>topobiology,</b> or altered spatial distribution, of mononuclear cells, which gives rise to disease-specific pat- terns, was described in molecular terms. A large number of diverse skin diseases were classified into six different groups, with each group highlighting distinctive cell types, adhesion molecules, chemotactic factors, and cytokines. The diseases within each group, which share functional anatomical reaction zones, were postulated to share common pathophysiologic pathways. Thus, it is now possible, as one scans the microscopic field, to look past the static images of red- and blue-stained cells and appreciate a dynamic and detailed medley of molecularly defined events emanating from the eyepiece...|$|E
40|$|Avian beak {{diversity}} {{is a classic}} example of morphological evolution. Recently, we showed that localized cell proliferation mediated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4) can explain the different shapes of chicken and duck beaks (Wu et al. [2004] Science 305 : 1465). Here, we compare further growth activities among chicken (conical and slightly curved), duck (straight and long), and cockatiel (highly curved) developing beak primordia. We found differential growth activities among different facial prominences and within one prominence. The duck has a wider frontal nasal mass (FNM), and more sustained fibroblast growth factor 8 activity. The cockatiel has a thicker FNM that grows more vertically and a relatively reduced mandibular prominence. In each prominence the number, size, and position of localized growth zones can vary: it is positioned more rostrally in the duck and more posteriorly in the cockatiel FNM, correlating with beak curvature. BMP 4 is enriched in these localized growth zones. When BMP activity is experimentally altered in all prominences, beak size was enlarged or reduced proportionally. When only specific prominences were altered, the prototypic conical shaped chicken beaks were converted into an array of beak shapes mimicking those in nature. These results suggest that the size of beaks can be modulated by the overall activity of the BMP pathway, which mediates the growth. The shape of the beaks can be fine-tuned by localized BMP activity, which mediates the range, level, and duration of locally enhanced growth. Implications of <b>topobiology</b> vs. molecular blueprint concepts in the Evo–Devo of avia...|$|E
