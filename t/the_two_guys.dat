500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} a [...] "good" [...] episode. He was positive towards the Logan and Keith storylines, writing [...] "the other main storylines, featuring Logan and Keith, were nice ones for the respective characters," [...] calling the half-brother plotline [...] "interesting". On the advancing of the rapist plot, Goldman praised the increase in Veronica's personal involvement with the case, while continuing to criticize the portrayal of the feminists in the episode. [...] "At this point, neither we, nor Veronica, seem to be meant to have nearly any sympathy for them. And yet, shouldn't we all naturally be able to connect more to a group of girls who are passionately seeking to stop a serial rapist on campus?" [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a very positive review, lauding the Logan's half-brother storyline, calling it [...] "Top quality stuff. I loved the moment when Veronica realized Logan's brother was an imposter and in the next scene we saw <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> surfing together. So much suspense!" [...] Television Without Pity gave [...] "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] a [...] "B+". The reviewer was very positive towards the plot involving Logan and his supposed half-brother, writing, [...] "since Logan actually knows how to find Charlie in person, perhaps this all doesn't have to be quite as tragic as it's coming off. Still, in my opinion? Best episode of the season so far." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics were}} {{polarized}} with [...] "Elementary School Musical". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C+' grade. Although he expressed satisfaction towards {{many aspects of}} the episode, such as the character development of Lisa Simpson, VanDerWerff criticized the songs performed in the episode. In response to the appearance of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the Flight of the Conchords, he stated: [...] "I have no idea if the writers wrote new songs for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: [...] "Bringing in the Glee kids to sing a take on [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that was, frankly, awful mostly just felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted. In contrast, Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that the [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode. Similarly, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic wrote, [...] "We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves. [...] Unlike the Glee kids, our favorite duo from New Zealand were given decent songs and some pretty great lines." [...] Hochberger gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{ending to}} the Cain novella {{called for the}} characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the Hays Production Code {{as a way to}} resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, and once that final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he began to wonder if the gas chamber ending was needed at all. [...] "You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men", Wilder said. As he would later recount, [...] "The story was between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>guys.</b> I knew it, even though I had already filmed the gas chamber scene... So we just took out the scene in the gas chamber," [...] despite its $150,000 cost to the studio. Removal of the scene, over Chandler's objection, also removed the Hays Office's single biggest remaining objection to the picture, since they regarded it as [...] "unduly gruesome" [...] and predicted that it would never be approved by local and regional censor boards. The footage and sound elements are lost, but production stills of the scene still exist.|$|E
