5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable <b>television</b> <b>recording</b> was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|Mills also {{ventured into}} the realm of fashion design. Ultimately, he created an elegant line of haute couture fashions, Moulins Originales, many of which were debuted in a fashion show titled The Integrity of Elegance. This showing was {{captured}} on a pioneering high-definition <b>television</b> <b>recording</b> at New York City’s Ed Sullivan Theater in February 1993. Another showing of Mills’ designs occurred at the Design Exchange in Toronto during the PRIME Mentors’ 10th Anniversary Celebration, in 1997.|$|E
25|$|A major {{milestone}} for {{the company}} was a <b>television</b> <b>recording</b> of Puccini's Tosca filmed in 1968 at the Adelaide Festival. This starred Tito Gobbi as Scarpia alongside two Australian singers, soprano Marie Collier in the title role, and tenor Donald Smith as Cavaradossi, with the Argentinian born, Italian conductor Carlo Felice Cillario conducting. This was the commencement {{of a long and}} fruitful association between the Australian Opera and Maestro Cillario until his retirement in 2003. Some of his first rehearsals in the country involved conducting the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra and the Australian Opera Chorus, both newly formed and on permanent contracts.|$|E

500|$|Communication between {{company and}} band was almost non-existent, and Pink Floyd's {{relationship}} with Tower and Capitol was therefore poor. Barrett's mental condition mirrored {{the problems that}} King encountered; when the band performed at Winterland, he detuned his guitar during [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] until the strings fell off. His odd behaviour grew worse in subsequent performances, and during a <b>television</b> <b>recording</b> for The Pat Boone Show he confounded the director by lip-syncing [...] "Apples and Oranges" [...] perfectly during the rehearsal, and then standing motionless during the take. King quickly curtailed the band's US visit, sending them home on the next flight.|$|E

By November 1931, Pooh was a $50 million-a-year business. Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film.|$|E

2500|$|She toured Australia {{many times}} and took on Australian guitarist Jimmy Doyle as her musical {{director}} in the 1960s. In 1962 she made a nationwide tour of Britain, with [...] "The Winifred Atwell Show". She was accompanied by the Cy Bevan Group, who were with her then current radio series [...] "Pianorama".

2500|$|By 1956, Springfield, {{with two}} other ABC shows, ranked behind only New York and Hollywood for {{originating}} network television programming. Top Talent was booking Jubilee artists across the country, and that April, the Jubilee had finished third among men. According to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch that February, [...] "Springfield has become the recognized center of the country music world. In fact, it is generally agreed in <b>television,</b> <b>recording</b> and radio circles, that Springfield, now a city of 90,000, has shaken Nashville, Tennessee, home of The Grand Ole Opry and long-time mecca of hillbilly musicians, to its very foundations." [...] But the 1957 departures of Porter Wagoner and Brenda Lee to the Music City signaled the shift would not be permanent, and Springfield never generated the business or revenues of Nashville.|$|E
