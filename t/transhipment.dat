5|$|Selby was {{the upper}} limit for {{seagoing}} ships at the time, and became a major <b>transhipment</b> port for the smaller boats using the canal. Canal boats were limited to about 60 tons, whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach Selby. By 1800, it was handling some 369,780 tons of goods, and the support industries of ropemaking, sailmaking and shipbuilding were expanding.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Selby Canal {{began in}} 1775, {{and it was}} opened on 29 April 1778. The new cut at Castleford opened in spring 1775, while those at Knostrop and Hunslet were {{finished}} in 1779. Methley cut was completed, but Woodlesford was not, as the company bought the mill there instead. All locks were replaced, and the total cost was over £60,000, of which around £20,000 was for the Selby Canal. The navigation remained profitable, paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775, which had risen to £32,000 by 1791. Most traffic now used the Selby route, and the <b>transhipment</b> facilities at Airmyn were closed in 1779.|$|E
5|$|A bitumen-surfaced second runway {{was built}} at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, {{after which the}} {{original}} runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing. The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, and a <b>transhipment</b> and staging area, overhaul facilities for PT boats, a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed. Milne Bay {{was used as a}} staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December. The base at Milne Bay remained operational {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

30|$|The {{first and}} most {{conspicuous}} step consists in constructing a revised version of the LSBCI. The underlying raw data is obtained from Lloyds List Intelligence (formally Containerisation International On-line) (“Lloyd’s List Intelligence - Containers,” n.d.). The dataset gives all the existing direct country pair connections and includes inter alia the number of ships sailing in this route, the TEU capacity of the largest vessel per direct route, the number of operators per route (both those who operate their own vessels {{and those who do}} not). The information is obtained annually, in the month of May. The data covers the reported deployment of all containerships at a given point in time. This methodology allows for comparisons over time, as the “sample” is always complete. UNCTAD started the systematic annual gathering of data in 2004 on the country level and in 2006 on the pair-of-country level. In addition to the LSBCI itself and its components which are defined and discussed in detail in next section, two novel variables are retrieved from this data: a variable indicating the number of <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries and, the effective maritime distance to be covered between any pair of countries. Note that only {{in the case of a}} direct maritime connection, the effective (computed) maritime distance coincides with sea distance. Note also that information on the number of <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries is symmetric: if two <b>transhipments</b> are necessary to move containers from country C to country D, then the same number of <b>transhipments</b> is necessary to move containers in the opposite direction from D to C.|$|R

Having left her air group behind to maximize the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 25 September, where she loaded over 2,000 American and Canadian PoWs. She dropped off the Americans at Pearl Harbor on 5 October and continued on to deliver her Canadian passengers at Vancouver six days later. Opened for public tours, Implacable remained for a week before sailing to Hong Kong to pick up several hundred PoWs and continued onwards to Manila to load 2,114 more passengers. She delivered them to Balikpapan, Borneo for <b>transhipment</b> to Britain. In their place the carrier embarked 2,126 men of the 7th Australian Division, and their equipment, to return to Australia. She arrived at Sydney on 17 November and sailed on 8 December to load more returning troops from Papua New Guinea. Arriving back at Sydney before Christmas, the ship had her additional bunks, etc., removed to return her to operational status.|$|E

Four distinct strategies are considered. “Electronic point of sales (EPOS) ”, where marketplace information is forwarded to all players throughout the supply chain; “Excel”, where the stock levels in all echelons {{are controlled by}} the factory; “Emergency transhipments”, where an express transportation route bypassing an echelon in the supply chain is permitted; “Eliminate”, where an echelon {{is removed from the}} supply chain. The Beer Game strategies are also studied via a simulation exercise. Results show that the Excel strategy is flawed, whereas the EPOS strategy has a strong impact on inventory cost, Emergency <b>transhipments</b> has a strong impact on customer service level and Eliminate results in less stock for an improved customer service level. Combinations of the three viable strategies are also tested. This paper concludes that the three strategies can be integrated to significantly improve supply chain performance...|$|R

25|$|Thus {{began the}} Malayalam Era, known as Kolla Varsham after the city, {{indicating}} {{the importance of}} Kollam in the 9th century. The Persian merchant Soleyman of Siraf visited Malabar in the 9th century and found Quilon {{to be the only}} port in India used by the huge Chinese ships as their <b>transhipment</b> hub for goods on their way from China to the Persian Gulf. The rulers of Kollam (formerly called 'Desinganadu') had trade relations with China and exchanged embassies. According to the records of the Tang dynasty (618–913), Quilon was their chief port of call before the 7th century. The Chinese trade decreased about 600 and was again revived in the 13th century. Mirabilia Descripta by Bishop Catalani gives a description of life in Kollam, which he saw as the Catholic bishop-designate to Kollam, the oldest Catholic diocese in India. He also gives true and imaginary descriptions of life in 'India the Major' in the period before Marco Polo visited the city.|$|E
25|$|Railways {{arrived in}} Lincoln in 1848. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway had {{negotiated}} with the proprietors of the Witham and Fossdyke in 1846, to guarantee them an income by leasing the waterways. Richard Ellison IV had agreed a lease for 894 years, at £9,570 per year, based on the average profit for the previous three years plus 5 per cent. The line was built by the Great Northern Railway, {{who took over the}} leases already agreed. The Witham was affected more than the Fossdyke, as the line followed its bank from Lincoln to Boston. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) passed through Saxilby to Lincoln a little later. Combined figures for the two waterways showed a drop in goods carried of two-thirds between 1848 and 1868. Cargos of coal and wool were the first to transfer to the railways. However, the MSLR, by then part of the Great Central Railway, built a dock and <b>transhipment</b> warehouse at Brayford in 1897. The Fossdyke carried 75,881 tons in 1905, and an average of 69,611 between 1913 and 1917, most of it general goods and agricultural produce. A series of takeovers and mergers resulted in its ownership changing several times, before it was nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Waterways Board in 1948.|$|E

A centralized supply chain model is then discussed. The game model is further extended to uncertain demand situations.

50|$|At {{the time}} of Federation, {{standard}} gauge was used in only NSW, but was favoured for further work. Work on gauge conversion was assisted by section 51 (xxxiii) of the Constitution of Australia, which made specific provisions for the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to railway acquisition and construction. An agreement was made with the South Australian and Western Australian state governments for the Trans-Australian Railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, with work started in 1911 and completed in 1917. However, with the different gauges, to ship goods from Queensland to Perth required four <b>transhipments.</b>|$|R

The fall of Lae ended its utility, so he reduced his estimate of the number of Japanese troops in the area to 350. Based on this appreciation, GHQ believed that Finschhafen would be a [...] "pushover".|$|E

On 11 March 1872, a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the Bristol Harbour Railway, a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe on its way to a wharf downstream of Bristol Bridge.|$|E

500|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} {{the main source of}} revenue for the GWR when it first opened but goods were also carried in {{separate}} trains. It was not until the coal-mining and industrial districts of Wales and the Midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant; in 1856 the Ruabon Coal Company signed an agreement with the GWR to transport coal to London at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least £40,000 each year to the railway. As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton. The many smaller consignments were sent to a local <b>transhipment</b> centre where they were re-sorted into larger loads for the main segment of their journey. There were more than 550 [...] "station truck" [...] workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying small consignments to and from specified stations, and 200 [...] "pick up" [...] trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{stations}} were located {{near to the}} landing stages which the steam packets used, and the railway did all it could to draw passengers away from the river. This included the provision of fourth-class carriages, with fares set at a halfpenny per mile, in 1850, and by 1863, the steam packet boats had ceased operation. Freight traffic also declined, with coal passing through the Grand Sluice dropping from 19,535 tons in 1847 to 3,780 tons in 1857. Nevertheless, the railway company had to maintain the river, and in 1871, spent £5,000 on making Bardney lock deeper by [...] {{at the request of}} the drainage commissioners. The GNR leased the navigation to the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Committee in 1882, and in 1897, by which time the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had become the Great Central Railway, they built a large warehouse beside Brayford Pool, with a <b>transhipment</b> dock next to it. Total traffic on the river had fallen to 18,548 tons in 1905, and averaged 5,870 tons during the years of the First World War, mainly general merchandise and agricultural produce. With the nationalisation of the waterways following the Second World War, the navigation eventually became the responsibility of British Waterways as a result of the Transport Act 1962, and since 2 July 2012 has been managed by the Canal & River Trust.|$|E

50|$|Railways could {{supplement}} {{water transport}} and, as Nyasaland was nowhere nearer than 200 miles to a suitable Indian Ocean port, a short rail link to river ports that eliminated porterage was initially more practical than a line direct {{to the coast}} passing through areas of low population. The Shire Highlands Railway opened a line from Blantyre to Chiromo in 1907, and extended it to Port Herald, 113 miles from Blantyre in 1908. After Port Herald became unsatisfactory, the British South Africa Company built the Central African Railway, mainly in Mozambique, of 61 miles from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi in 1914. From here, goods went by river steamers to Chinde then by sea to Beira, involving three <b>transhipments</b> and delays.
