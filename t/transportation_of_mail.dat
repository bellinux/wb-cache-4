50|$|A {{post road}} is a road {{designated}} for the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> postal <b>mail.</b> In past centuries, only major towns had a post {{house and the}} roads used by post riders or mail coaches to carry mail among them were particularly important ones or, due to the special attention given them, became so. In various centuries and countries, post road became more or less equivalent to main road, royal road, or highway. The 20th century spread of postal service blurred the distinction.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad reached Petoskey in 1873. This {{opened up}} the {{surrounding}} area to tourism, settlers, and lumbermen. This eventually led to various people proposing different ideas for the water way. One such plan was the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> along the waterway. This involved the dredging of Crooked River. Freight was eventually transported along the route. With {{the advent of the}} railroad as a cheaper means with which to move goods, the Inland Waterway fell into decline.|$|E
5000|$|The Act of August 24, 1912, {{establishing}} {{the joint committee}} required {{the creation of a}} 6-member committee, consisting of three senators and three representatives. Membership was to come from the Senate Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads and the House Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads. The committee was ordered to [...] "make inquiry into the subject of postage on second-class mail matter and compensation for the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and to report at the earliest practicable date." ...|$|E
50|$|Sop's {{island was}} {{inhabited}} until the mid-1950s, {{when the government}} resettled the families to the mainland. Sop's Island residents were encouraged to move by the Joey Smallwood Government to ease the economic burden of public education, <b>transportation</b> (<b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> food and other supplies) and utilities. Access to Sop's Island was often hindered {{in the spring of}} the year due to impassable slob ice. This proved to be a serious health hazard for those needing immediate medical attention. Locals also complained of the inconsistent water supply on Sop's Island.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of the province of Manitoba from the former Rupert's Land in 1870 {{marked the end of}} the HBC trade monopoly. In 1872 Kittson joined up with another former competitor, James Jerome Hill, forming the Red River Transportation Company. The line had five steamboats, and Kittson had invested $75,000 by 1873. They were the only operators on the Red River during the 1870s, and were important factors in the development of Winnipeg and south Manitoba through the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> immigrants, <b>mail</b> and supplies.|$|R
5000|$|For {{about the}} first half century of its existence, <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> via {{aircraft}} was usually categorized and sold as a separate service (airmail) from surface mail. Today it {{is often the case}} that mail service is categorized and sold according to transit time alone, with mode of transport (land, sea, air) being decided on the back end in dynamic intermodal combinations. Thus even [...] "regular" [...] mail may make part of its journey on an aircraft. Such [...] "air-speeded" [...] mail is different from nominal airmail in its branding, price, and priority of service.|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th century, foreign {{countries}} maintained courier services through their official missions in the Empire, to permit <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> between those countries and Constantinople. Nine countries had negotiated [...] "Capitulations" [...] or treaties with the Ottomans, which granted various extraterritorial rights {{in exchange for}} trade opportunities. Such agreements permitted Russia (1720 & 1783), Austria (1739), France (1812), Great Britain (1832) and Greece (1834), as well as Germany, Italy, Poland, and Romania, to maintain post offices in the Ottoman Empire. Some of these developed into public mail services, used to transmit mail to Europe.|$|E
50|$|Significant early {{legislation}} that affected the post-riders included {{an act of}} the United States Congress in 1838 that declared that all railroads in the United States were post roads. The act had a twofold effect: it increased the use of railroads to transmit the mails and limited the use of post riders to postal districts that were not on railway routes. In those {{areas of the country}} that were not on railroad routes, mail was carried by contractors, and the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> by any means other than by water or railroad was called star route service.|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, the Railway Mail Service (RMS), {{headed by}} George B. Armstrong, was officially inaugurated {{to handle the}} <b>transportation</b> and sorting <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> aboard trains. [...] Armstrong was {{promoted}} from a supervisory position in the Chicago post office following his experiments in 1864 with a converted route agent's car on runs between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} hostilities, she {{anchored}} in Buckner Bay until 24 September, when she sailed for Nagasaki, Japan, arriving 25 September for various duties {{in support of the}} occupation <b>of</b> Japan, including <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> passengers, <b>mail,</b> and light freight between Nagasaki, Sasebo, and Okinawa. She cleared Sasebo 15 October for Saipan, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, California, arriving 10 November 1945. Corbesier was placed out of commission in reserve 2 July 1946, berthed at San Diego. On 1 December 1972 she was struck from Navy list records, and, on 3 December 1973, she was sold for scrapping.|$|R
5000|$|Early work in {{operational}} research {{was carried out}} by individuals such as Charles Babbage. His research into the cost <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> and sorting <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> led to England's universal [...] "Penny Post" [...] in 1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the GWR's broad gauge. Percy Bridgman brought {{operational research}} to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences.|$|R
