He explains that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> eternity together.

Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough money to buy a new plasma screen television.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} Merlin's priority, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as the Whirlwind had been tightly designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine at this stage was not a feasible option. Only 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines (301) were built.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} as never before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans no longer had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn {{led to the emergence}} of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E

Because she was being held in Mexico on October 26, 1964—the scheduled date for her fourth trial {{in the murder of}} her husband—Kinne's $25,000 bond was revoked on that date. Though the United Bond Insurance Company, which had posted the bond, argued that paperwork irregularities rendered the issuance of Kinne's bail illegal, the court ordered the company to forfeit the bond. Kinne was reportedly concerned about the monetary implications of this forfeiture: [...] "I could always use the money," [...] the Altus Times-Democrat quoted her as saying.

After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road, where Inna enters to sing on a stage.

Next, in line 6, the quatrain addresses how people give up simpler pleasures in order <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of their resources [...] "and more" [...] on their foolish obsessions.

2500|$|The Nazis {{fell into}} a trap of perception—the {{seemingly}} high birth rate of Poles was one of consequences of expelling all Poles from higher classes into General Government—as such the Poles who remained were the ones with high birth rate, while those with few kids were no longer present. Stripping Poles of all cultural activity by the Germans and leaving them <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> time outside of work in homes, led to conditions favourable to sex and the rising birth rate. One practice that had terrible effects on Polish women was the refusal for female slave workers to travel home for birth. Pregnancies by Polish women-workers were subject to abortion, and in case of birth, the children were taken by SS Lebensborn. Polish slave labourers naturally were forbidden to engage in marriage. The harsh nature of the German occupation however reduced the birth rate. [...] In Poznań, {{at the end of}} the war, the birth rate was near zero; in Łódź and Innowrocław, the birth rate was negative-they were more deaths then births. In comparison, the birth rate of Germans rose until the end of the war. From 1939's birth rate survival of 850 live births per 1000 births, the rate fell to 680 per 1000 births in 1944.|$|E

[...] It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked.... August 1951 was the end of an era. Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: [...] "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place.... We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable". [...] Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, [...] "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [...] ... I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement. [...] But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted."
