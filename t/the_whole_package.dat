Yiddish theater had become a {{business}} there, with slickly written advertisements, coordinated performances in multiple cities using the same publicity materials, and cutthroat competition: on one occasion in 1895, a young man named Bernfeld attended multiple performances of Goldfaden's Story of Isaac, memorized it all (including the songs), and took <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> to Kalman Juvilier, who put on an unauthorized production in Iaşi.

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E

2500|$|This assault forced Dr Hewson into {{a partial}} backdown, agreeing not to levy the GST on food. But this {{concession}} opened Hewson {{to charges of}} weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the arithmetic of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>package,</b> since the weakening of the GST reduced the scope for tax cuts, the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the new package were famously demonstrated in the [...] "birthday cake interview", in which Hewson was unable {{to answer a question}} posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as {{a turning point in the}} election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: [...] "Well I answered the question honestly. The answer's actually right.

Yes, it could have been better had a couple of the events been tightened up in the gameplay department, and yeah, it would have made a lot more sense had the characters been more diverse from one another (Is it me, or is EVERYONE five foot nine?), but I guess that's what sequels are for.

6000|$|Upon {{the return}} of Glen from abroad, the commonest courtesy, {{not to say the}} blood-relation between them, {{prompted}} Pierre to welcome him home, with a letter, which though not over-long, and little enthusiastic, still breathed a spirit of cousinly consideration and kindness, pervadingly touched by the then naturally frank and all-attractive spirit of Pierre. To this, the less earnest and now Europeanized Glen had replied in a letter all sudden suavity; and in a strain of artistic artlessness, mourned the apparent decline of their friendship; yet fondly trusted that now, notwithstanding their long separation, it would revive with added sincerity. Yet upon accidentally fixing his glance upon the opening salutation of this delicate missive, Pierre thought he perceived certain, not wholly disguisable chirographic tokens, that the [...] "My very dear Pierre," [...] with which the letter seemed to have been begun, had originally been written [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] but that when all was concluded, and Glen's signature put to it, then the ardent words [...] "My very" [...] had been prefixed to the reconsidered [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] a casual supposition, which possibly, however unfounded, materially retarded any answering warmth in Pierre, lest his generous flame should only embrace a flaunted feather. Nor was this idea altogether unreinforced, when on the reception of a second, and now half-business letter (of which mixed sort nearly all the subsequent ones were), from Glen, he found that the [...] "My very dear Pierre" [...] had already retreated into [...] "My dear Pierre;" [...] and on a third occasion, into [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] and on a fourth, had made a forced and very spirited advanced march up to [...] "My dearest Pierre." [...] All of which fluctuations augured ill for the determinateness of that love, which, however immensely devoted to one cause, could yet hoist and sail under the flags of all nations. Nor could he but now applaud a still subsequent letter from Glen, which abruptly, and almost with apparent indecorousness, under the circumstances, commenced the strain of friendship without any overture of salutation whatever; as if at last, owing to its infinite delicateness, entirely hopeless of precisely defining the nature of their mystical love, Glen chose rather to leave that precise definition to the sympathetical heart and imagination of Pierre; while he himself would go on to celebrate the general relation, by many a sugared sentence of miscellaneous devotion. It was a little curious and rather sardonically diverting, to compare these masterly, yet not wholly successful, and indeterminate tactics of the accomplished Glen, with the unfaltering stream of Beloved Pierres, which not only flowed along the top margin of all his earlier letters, but here and there, from their subterranean channel, flashed out in bright intervals, through all the succeeding lines. Nor had the chance recollection of these things at all restrained the reckless hand of Pierre, when he threw <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> of letters, both new and old, into that most honest and summary of all elements, which is neither a respecter of persons, nor a finical critic of what manner of writings it burns; but like ultimate Truth itself, of which it is the eloquent symbol, consumes all, and only consumes.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a new deployable structure concept for a low altitude L or P-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite. The structure {{consists of four}} cylindrical surfaces formed from thin sheets of carbon-fibre-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) connected by flexible hinges along the edges. The key to forming a cylindrical surface with any required shape is in the cutting/joining profile for the sheets. For a parabolic cylinder, this profile can be found analytically, given the focal length, aperture distance, and offset distance of the reflector. The structure is folded by first collapsing it essentially flat and then Z-folding it into a compact package. At full scale the reflective surface will be 7. 9 m long by 3. 2 m wide, {{and it has been}} estimated that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>packaged</b> structure would fit in an envelope of 3. 2 m by 1. 6 m by 0. 3 m. The last dimension depends on the minimum bend radius of CFRP thin sheets, which is estimated theoretically and also measured experimentally. The performance of the connections between different sheets, made with woven-glass tape, has been determined experimentally. An overall design for a full size reflector is presented, sized for optimal structural performance using the finite element software ABAQUS, and demonstrated by designing, constructing and testing a half-scale high-fidelity demonstrator...|$|R
