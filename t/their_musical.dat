5|$|Daft Punk {{are noted}} {{for their use}} of visual {{components}} associated with <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured distinctive characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{response}} to the band's debut album Go to the Future, Sakanaction's A team pushed them to quickly follow this up with a second album. They felt extremely pressured while creating the album, especially by <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> director at Victor Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow. and R.E.M.. The band draw <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in the Back and Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old {{to have a major}} impact on <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E

5|$|Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn began <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> {{careers in}} the 1980s playing in a garage band, The Plebes. After a few gigs, {{creative}} differences between the members {{led to the development}} of a punk rock sound for the band. As punk rock was unpopular in the St. Louis region, the band changed their style to blues-rock and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this point, they stopped performing covers and began to write their own songs.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words (Lieder ohne Worte), eight cycles each {{containing}} six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain {{his most}} famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many critics to underrate <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> value. Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own, included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarole), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles, and Edvard Grieg.|$|E

5|$|Musical {{instruments}} such as zithers {{appeared in}} Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier. Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi shaped {{the development of}} musical instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music {{similar to that of}} the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> instruments according to their material makeup.|$|E
5|$|Sons of Soul was {{produced}} entirely by the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment. They intended {{to pay homage to}} <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> influences—classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s—and incorporated live instrumentation, funk, and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches. Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from video}} games and toys, the series has also seen the release of its films' soundtracks.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Cuban {{brothers}} and musicians Cesar (Armand Assante) and Nestor Castillo (Antonio Banderas) flee from Havana, Cuba after {{getting into a}} violent dispute with the mobster owners of a club where they performed. Eventually ending up in New York City, the brothers work at menial jobs while attempting to revive <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> careers. At a nightclub where Cesar briefly crashes the act of mambo star Tito Puente, they make new friends and connections, as well as meeting cigarette girl Lanna Lake (Cathy Moriarty), who falls quickly into {{a love affair with}} Cesar.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band shrouded in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of {{the first}} wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal, although <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands.|$|E

50|$|While <b>their</b> other <b>musical</b> act (Fightstar) was on hiatus, Westaway and Haigh {{decided to}} focus on <b>their</b> other <b>musical</b> venture, GUNSHIP. They are joined by their long-time {{collaborator}} and close friend, Alex Gingell. Until today, they have released a self-titled album, which has been well received by the audiences and critics alike.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E
5|$|Producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler {{acquired}} the film {{rights to the}} novel in 1988, and commissioned Doyle, a first-time screenwriter, to write an adaptation. Doyle spent one year working on the script before Myles brought in veteran screenwriters Clement and La Frenais to help complete it. Upon reading the novel, Parker signed on as the film's director in 1989. The Commitments was the first film to be produced by Beacon Communications, which provided an estimated budget of $12–15 million. The film's young lead actors were mostly inexperienced, and were cast due to <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> backgrounds and resemblance to {{the characters in the}} novel. Principal photography commenced in Dublin, Ireland from late August 1990 to October of that year.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's editing {{of works}} by The Five is significant. It was a {{practical}} extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and {{was an effort to}} save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of passages from César Cui's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to educate people in music, cultivate <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{enhanced}} the Furs' sound by adding new elements to <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> arrangements – {{along with his}} own varied musical contributions, Rundgren brought in session musicians to augment the band. Gary Windo was a renowned saxophonist in the jazz world who had in recent years collaborated with major rock acts like Ian Hunter and Nick Mason. Extra horn work was contributed by Donn Adams, a longtime player with the American blues-rock band NRBQ. A classical cellist, Ann Sheldon, was recruited from the Royal College of Music. Lastly, the seasoned pop backing vocal team of Flo & Eddie were called by Rundgren to round out many of the songs. The instrumentalists had all been accepted by the band willingly, even enthusiastically – the backing vocalists, however, were another matter.|$|E
5|$|The Five {{was among}} the myriad of {{subjects}} Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from <b>their</b> <b>musical</b> world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took {{a back seat to}} his official duties as a professor of chemistry.|$|E
