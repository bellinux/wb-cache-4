40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} studies have {{analysed}} the player transfer market in English professional football. This paper examines whether similar factors operate to determine <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> in the semiprofessional, or nonleague, game. An empirical model of the nonleague player transfer market is developed in which observed <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> are determined by player characteristics, time effects, selling-club characteristics and buying-club characteristics. Using data on 114 <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> covering the period 1988 to 1997, we find evidence that the data generating process for <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> is broadly similar in both professional and nonleague football. ...|$|R

40|$|Ericson {{argued in}} this journal that the Bosman ruling, the {{abolition}} of <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> after the expiration of contracts, is inefficient. But, Ericson's model is implausible because transfers in only one direction are assumed and the so-called <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> are indirect salary payments. His model is also inconsistent because of double counting of salaries {{in the case of}} free agency. Furthermore, even within his model the efficiency of the Bosman ruling can be shown by assuming lifetime contracts. The real danger to efficiency is new considerations of the European Commission to abolish <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> before the expiration of contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sports clubs often {{trade in}} players {{with each other}} through the player {{transfer}} system. Using the doctrinal research methodology, the study aims at providing an interpretative analysis of the income tax implications from transfer of professional soccer players between professional soccer clubs, based on the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (South Africa, 1962) (hereafter the Act) and the relevant case law. The research methodology used is the doctrinal research methodology which involved an extended review of literature. This article concludes whether the <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> arising from the transfer of soccer players {{should be included in the}} gross income or be subject to capital gains tax in determining the taxable income of the transferor club. In addition, the study also determines whether the transferee club can deduct the <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> in respect of the <b>transfer</b> <b>fees</b> paid in acquisition of player rights under s 11 (a) of the Act...|$|R
