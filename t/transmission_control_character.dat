40|$|Abstract—Multi-source data {{transmission}} in wireless video sensor networks is a challenging problem {{because of the}} high bandwidth demand of video streams and the many-to-one traffic pattern. This paper proposes forepressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> for efficient and fair video transmission in this scenario. Contrary to traditional backpressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> where downstream node creates backpressure and causes upstream node to hold off when its buffer is full, forepressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> creates forepressure and signals upstream node to transmit when the downstream node’s buffer is not full. Forepressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> proactively avoids congestion at little communication overhead. In addition, it is able to provide fairness among concurrent flows. We evaluate forepressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> via NS- 2 simulations, and compare it with both backpressure congestion control and end-to-end rate regulation. Results in three typical topologies show that forepressure <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> achieves much lower loss ratio and ensures better fairness than the other two schemes.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{toward the}} design of new network layer protocols for emerging wireless ad hoc networks based on a foundation of variable-range <b>transmission</b> <b>control.</b> Wireless ad hoc networks represent autonomous distributed systems that are infrastructureless, fully distributed and multihop in nature.

The advantage of using variable-range <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> is twofold.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Transmission</b> <b>control</b> {{protocol}} {{has been}} adapted to {{various types of}} wireless networks (e. g., IEEE 802. 11 WLAN, 3 G cellular and ad hoc networks). However, wireless <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol flows are much shorter than wired flows due to the time varying characteristics of wireless networks. Hence, <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol performance in these networks {{is determined by the}} start up effects such as connection establishment. Several analytical models were proposed to describe the steady-state behaviour of short-lived <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol flows in wired networks, while few similar studies targeted wireless networks. Moreover, almost all of the previous models did not investigate the effect of heterogeneity (e. g., link speed and segment loss probability) of wireless networks on the end-to-end performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol flows. In this paper, a recursive and analytical model is developed and used to determine the performance of shortlived <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol flows in heterogeneous wired-cum-wireless networks in terms of average completion time. Two different schemes are proposed to solve the wireless loss problems by the end hosts, namely, end-to-end scheme and connection division scheme. The proposed analytical model has been validated by means of simulations using NS- 2 simulator. Performance results show that the proposed model is in close analogy with values obtained from the analytical model. As such, the proposed model can be used to accurately tune many parameters that affect the behaviour of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol in wired-cum-wireless networks...|$|R
