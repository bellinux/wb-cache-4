Unlike the even-toed ungulates, they digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than {{in one or more}} stomach chambers. The order includes three extant families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and <b>Tapiridae</b> (tapirs), with a total of about 17 species.

40|$|Mammalian {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) is a closed-circular double-helix molecule {{which contains}} two rRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and 22 tRNA genes. The molecule {{has become a}} popular tool in phylogenetic analyses owing to its relatively high evolutionary rate, simple genetic structure, small size, and compact gene arrangement. The order Perissodactyla includes the extant families Equidae, <b>Tapiridae</b> and Rhinocerotidae. The order and the three families are well defined, but the evolutionary relationship among the three lineages has not been settled conclusively. Some authors include the Hyracoidea in the Perissodactyla, but {{in the present study}} the narrower definition of the order is maintained. The present analyses are based on the complete mtDNA sequence of the horse, donkey, tapir, Indian and white rhinoceroses by which the evolution of the Perissodactyla is addressed at the molecular level. Characteristics of various mammalian mtDNAs so far reported are also summarized, including a comparison of repetitive motifs occurring in the control region of many mammalian mtDNAs. Repetitive motifs of this kind characterize perissodactyl mtDNAs. Heteroplasmy with respect to the different number of repetitive motifs in different mtDNAs of the same specimen were also recorded in all perissodactyl species. The intra- and interfamilial evolutionary relationships among the perissodactyls were studied on the basis of concatenated nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of all mitochondrial protein-coding genes, excluding NADH 6. The analyses of the concatenated aa sequences (3, 596 aa) did not resolve conclusively the relationship among the three perissodactyl families. The nt dataset of the same protein-coding genes joined <b>Tapiridae</b> and Rhinocerotidae to the exclusion of the Equidae. This topology was supported further by addition of the sequences of the two rRNA genes and the 22 tRNA genes. The resulting topology of the present study, based on the concatenated mitochondrial coding genes sequences (13, 652 nt), is consistent with the classical view of perissodactyl relationships. Molecular dating based on a recently established reference, namely, the evolutionary divergence of artiodactyls and cetaceans set at 60 million years before the present, MYBP, dated the divergence between Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla (+ Cetacea) at ‰ 68 MYBP. The divergence between Equidae and Rhinocerotidae + <b>Tapiridae</b> was dated at 48 MYBP, that between the tapir and rhinoceroses at 43 MYBP, that between the Indian and white rhinoceroses at 27 MYBP, and that between the horse and the donkey at 9 MYBP...|$|E

The study of the small mammals brought this locality to international recognition as the type locality for the European mammalian reference level MP 29 (latest Oligocene). Our study reviews the terrestrial herbivorous mammals of Rickenbach and aims to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions in which they lived.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{checklist}} of flying and non-flying mammal species which occur in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, delimiting species by vegetation domains and vulnerability. Records were based on specimens in museums, literature, and only eventually on photos (by camera traps). There are 151 mammal species reported or collected in the state, comprising 10 orders and 29 families. The richest orders were Chiroptera (61 spp.), Rodentia (35), Carnivora (18), and Didelphimorphia (16). The richest families were Phyllostomidae (33 species), Cricetidae (23), Didelphidae (16), Molossidae (13), Vespertilionidae (9), Felidae (7), and Dasypodidae (6). Cerrado was the richest domain (117 spp.) followed by Pantanal (110).

40|$|The order Perissodactyla, {{the group}} of {{odd-toed}} ungulates, includes three extant families: Equidae, <b>Tapiridae,</b> and Rhinocerotidae. The extremely rapid karyotypic diversification in perissodactyls has so far prevented the establishment of genome-wide homology maps between these three families by traditional cytogenetic approaches. Here we report the first genome-wide comparative chromosome maps of African rhinoceroses, four tapir species, four equine species, and humans. These maps were established by multidirectional chromosome painting, with paint probes derived from flow-sorted chromosomes of Equus grevyi, Tapirus indicus, and Ceratotherium simum as well as painting probes from horse and human. The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), Baird's tapir (T. bairdii), mountain tapir (T. pinchaque), lowland tapir (T. terrestris), and onager (E. hemionus onager), were studied by cross-species chromosome painting for the first time. Our results, when integrated with previously published comparative chromosome maps of the other perissodactyl species, have enabled the reconstruction of perissodactyl, ceratomorph, and equid ancestral karyotypes, and {{the identification of the}} defining evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements along each lineage. Our results allow a more reliable estimate of the mode and tempo of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements, revealing a striking switch between the slowly evolving ceratomorphs and extremely rapidly evolving equids. © 2008 Springer.

40|$|Picture {{frame and}} tapir’s nose. The tapir (Brazilian- from Tupi language) is any of several large hoglike mammals {{of the genus}} Tapirus, of {{tropical}} America (South America and Central America) and the Southeast Asia- Malayan peninsula. Tapirs have a long flexible snout (proboscis), and four toes to the fore feet and three to the hind ones. They feed on plants and move about night. Due to its large size, the tapir has few natural predators in its environment. The human {{is believed to be}} the most common predator of the tapir as they have been hunted for food and even domesticated in some areas. The four species of tapirs are: the Brazilian or South American tapir, Tapirus terrestris, the Malayan tapir, Baird’s tapir and the Mountain tapir. All four are classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, including horses and rhinoceroses. The South American tapir is the size of a small ass, with a brown, nearly naked skin. The proboscis of the tapir is a highly flexible structure, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage that would otherwise be out of reach. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest. The evolution of tapir proboscises, made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures, gives the <b>Tapiridae</b> skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{mitochondrial}} genes, the protein-coding cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) {{gene and}} {{a portion of}} the 12 S rRNA gene, were used for phylo-genetic investigation of the mammalian order Peris-sodactyla. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} utilize the extensive fossil record of perissodactyls for calibrating molecular clocks and comparing estimates of divergence times using both genes and two fossil cali-bration points. Secondary objectives included clarifica-tion of previously unresolved relationships within Tap-iridae and comparison of the results of separate and combined analyses of two genes. Analyses included sev-eral perissodactyl lineages representing all three families (<b>Tapiridae,</b> Equidae, and Rhinocerotidae), most extant genera, all four species of tapirs, two to four species of rhinoceros, and two species of Equus. The application of a relatively recent fossil calibration point and a relatively ancient calibration point produced greatly different esti-mates of evolutionary rates and divergence times for both genes, even though a relative rates test did not find significant rate differences among taxa. A likelihood-ratio test, however, rejected a molecular clock for both genes. Neither calibration point produced estimates of divergence times consistent with paleontological evi-dence over a range of perissodactyl radiations. The com-bined analysis of both genes produces a well-resolved phylogeny with Perissodactyla that conforms to tradi-tional views of interfamilial relationships and supports monophyly of neotropical tapirs. Combining the data sets increases support for most nodes but decreases the sup-port for a neotropical tapir clade because the COII and 12 S rRNA data sets are in conflict for tapir relationships...|$|E

Kosowska, B., Strzała, T., Moska, M., Ratajszczak, R., Dobosz, T. - Seven lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) from Wrocław ZOO (three females and four males), differing {{from each other}} with {{exterior}} and sexual behaviour were verified with cytogenetic analysis in order to check their taxonomic status. Cytogenetic analysis was done using two alternative methods of blood collection: 1) conventionally with venepuncture, and 2) with blood sucking bugs from the Reduviidae family. Lymphocytes capable of growing were obtained only with conventional method of blood sampling. Karyotypes and karyograms of all analyzed tapirs were created using classical cytogenetic methods of chromosomes staining. All possessed karyograms had diploid chromosome number equal 80 (2 n = 80). Homologous chromosomes did not differ between each other with quantity, size, centromeres location, length of arms, G bands and all were classified as proper karyograms of Tapirus terrestris species representatives. The X chromosomes {{as well as the}} first pair of chromosomes (both metacentric), were the largest among all analyzed, respectively. All remaining 38 pairs of chromosomes were acrocentric with Y chromosome as the smallest one (in males’ karyograms). Blood collected with blood sucking bugs proved to be unsuitable for cell culture. None of the seven established cultures was effective as lymphocytes obtained with this method did not show growth potential in prepared media. Thus, blood collected from the tapirs via Dipetalogaster maxima species did not show usefulness for cytogenetic studies due to the inability of cells to proliferation, even after {{a relatively short period of}} time elapsed since the blood sampling (1 to 2 hours) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{the forces}} that shaped Neotropical {{diversity}} is central issue to explain tropical biodiversity and inform conservation action; yet {{few studies have examined}} large, widespread species. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrrestris, Perissodactyla, <b>Tapiridae)</b> is the largest Neotropical herbivore whose ancestors arrived in South America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. A Pleistocene diversification is inferred for the genus Tapirus from the fossil record, but only two species survived the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Here, we investigate the history of lowland tapir as revealed by variation at the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b, compare it to the fossil data, and explore mechanisms that could have shaped the observed structure of current populations. Results Separate methodological approaches found mutually exclusive divergence times for lowland tapir, either in the late or in the early Pleistocene, although a late Pleistocene divergence is more in tune with the fossil record. Bayesian analysis favored mountain tapir (T. pinchaque) paraphyly in relation to lowland tapir over reciprocal monophyly, corroborating the inferences from the fossil data these species are sister taxa. A coalescent-based analysis rejected a null hypothesis of allopatric divergence, suggesting a complex history. Based on the geographic distribution of haplotypes we propose (i) a central role for western Amazonia in tapir diversification, with a key role of the ecological gradient along the transition between Andean subcloud forests and Amazon lowland forest, and (ii) that the Amazon river acted as an barrier to gene flow. Finally, the branching patterns and estimates based on nucleotide diversity indicate a population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum. Conclusions This study is the first examining lowland tapir phylogeography. Climatic events {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene, parapatric speciation, divergence along the Andean foothill, and role of the Amazon river, have similarly shaped the history of other taxa. Nevertheless further work with additional samples and loci is needed to improve our initial assessment. From a conservation perspective, we did not find a correspondence between genetic structure in lowland tapir and ecogeographic regions proposed to define conservation priorities in the Neotropics. This discrepancy sheds doubt into this scheme's ability to generate effective conservation planning for vagile species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Ancient protein {{sequences}} {{are increasingly}} used to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between extinct and extant mammalian taxa. Here, we apply these recent developments to Middle Pleistocene bone specimens of the rhinoceros genus Stephanorhinus. No biomolecular sequence data is currently available for this genus, leaving phylogenetic hypotheses on its evolutionary relationships to extant and extinct rhinoceroses untested. Furthermore, recent phylogenies based on Rhinocerotidae (partial or complete) mitochondrial DNA sequences {{differ in the}} placement of the Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis). Therefore, studies utilising ancient protein sequences from Middle Pleistocene contexts have the potential to provide further insights into the phylogenetic relationships between extant and extinct species, including Stephanorhinus and Dicerorhinus. Methods ZooMS screening (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry) was performed on several Late and Middle Pleistocene specimens from the genus Stephanorhinus, subsequently followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to obtain ancient protein sequences from a Middle Pleistocene Stephanorhinus specimen. We performed parallel analysis on a Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros specimen and extant species of rhinoceroses, resulting in the availability of protein sequence data for five extant species and two extinct genera. Phylogenetic analysis additionally included all extant Perissodactyla genera (Equus, Tapirus), and was conducted using Bayesian (MrBayes) and maximum-likelihood (RAxML) methods. Results Various ancient proteins were identified in both the Middle and Late Pleistocene rhinoceros samples. Protein degradation and proteome complexity are consistent with an endogenous origin of the identified proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of informative proteins resolved the Perissodactyla phylogeny in agreement with previous studies in regards to {{the placement of the}} families Equidae, <b>Tapiridae,</b> and Rhinocerotidae. Stephanorhinus is shown to be most closely related to the genera Coelodonta and Dicerorhinus. The protein sequence data further places the Sumatran rhino in a clade together with the genus Rhinoceros, opposed to forming a clade with the black and white rhinoceros species. Discussion The first biomolecular dataset available for Stephanorhinus places this genus together with the extinct genus Coelodonta and the extant genus Dicerorhinus. This is in agreement with morphological studies, although we are unable to resolve the order of divergence between these genera based on the protein sequences available. Our data supports the placement of the genus Dicerorhinus in a clade together with extant Rhinoceros species. Finally, the availability of protein sequence data for both extinct European rhinoceros genera allows future investigations into their geographic distribution and extinction chronologies...|$|E
