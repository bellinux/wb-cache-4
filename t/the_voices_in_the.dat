5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer movements in the style of Bach's motets.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724, which is in B minor, uses oboes d'amore in the first movement and brass playing colla parte with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last movement, a choir of cornett (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) (or trumpets (Tr)). According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by brass, matching the scoring of the other audition piece. The originally composed version, which was not performed until 1728, was in C minor, had oboes in the opening movement and no brass. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E

500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (God, as Your name is, so also Your praise is to {{the ends}} of the world.), deals with {{universal}} praise of God's name is a choral fugue. While the trumpets are independent, the strings and oboes mostly double <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Bach's motets. The first trumpet even plays the fugue theme. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr argues that the work is probably no new composition but the reworking of an older lost movement, which forms the basis of both this movement and the later second part of the Credo of this music to the Mass in B minor, [...] ( [...] almighty father, maker of Heaven and Earth). The idea of both is the [...] "world-embracing almighty power of God".|$|E
500|$|... (We thank you, God, {{we thank}} you), , {{is a sacred}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} it in Leipzig in 1731 for , the annual inauguration of a new town council, and first performed it on 27 August of that year. The cantata {{was part of a}} festive service in the [...] The cantata text by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the beginning of Psalm 75, and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann's [...] "". Bach scored the work in eight movements for four vocal parts and a festive Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings, an obbligato organ and basso continuo. The organ dominates the first movement Sinfonia which Bach derived from a Partita for violin. The full orchestra accompanies the first choral movement and plays with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing chorale, while a sequence of three arias alternating with two recitatives is scored intimately.|$|E

An [...] "ever-ascending" [...] instrumental [...] "evokes {{the image of the}} road of suffering embodied by going up to Jerusalem". The Evangelist begins the narration (...) [...] Jesus announces his future suffering in Jerusalem, [...] ("Behold, we go up to Jerusalem"). He sings, while the ritornello is played several times. After another repeat of the ritornello as an interlude, a choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples, following verse 34 from the Gospel (...) : [...] ("However they understood nothing"). The voices are first accompanied only by the continuo, then doubled by the other instruments.

500|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata {{in the court}} chapel of Schloss Weimar on 17 June 1714, as his fourth work {{in a series of}} monthly cantatas for the Weimar court which came with his promotion to [...] (concert master) in 1714. The so-called Weimar version, his first composition for an ordinary Sunday {{in the second half of}} the liturgical year, marked also a farewell to Duke Johann Ernst who began a journey then. A revision occurred during the Köthen years, specifically in 1720. A performance, documented by original parts, could have been in Hamburg to apply for the position as organist at St. Jacobi in November 1720, this time in nine movements and in D minor instead of C minor. As [...] in Leipzig, Bach {{performed the}} cantata again on his third Sunday in office on 13 June 1723, as the title page shows. For this performance, now of eleven movements beginning again in C minor, he also changed the instrumentation, adding for example four trombones to double <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stanza of the hymn. This version was used in several revivals during Bach's lifetime and is mostly played today.|$|E

The {{producer}} of Universal Interactive proposed that rather than conventional music, an [...] "urban chaotic symphony" [...] would be created by Andy Gavin causing random sound effects (such as bird vocalizations, vehicle horns, grunts, and flatulence) to be randomly selected and combined. When this proposal was rejected, David Siller introduced the team to the music production company Mutato Muzika and its founder Mark Mothersbaugh. Following this introduction, Mothersbaugh selected Josh Mancell to compose the music for the game based on his previous work on [...] Mothersbaugh advised Mancell throughout the soundtrack's demo stages, after which all composition duties of Crash Bandicoot and Naughty Dog's subsequent six titles were delegated to Mancell. Mouse on Mars, A Guy Called Gerald, Aphex Twin and Juan Atkins served as influences on Mancell's [...] "simple but kind of off-kilter" [...] melodies. Dave Baggett served as the soundtrack's producer. The sound effects were created by Mike Gollom, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears of Universal Sound Studios. <b>The</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game were provided by Brendan O'Brien.|$|E
2500|$|In school, Eno used a tape {{recorder}} as a musical instrument and experimented with his first, sometimes improvisational, bands. St. Joseph's College teacher and painter Tom Phillips encouraged him, recalling [...] "Piano Tennis" [...] with Eno, in which, after collecting pianos, they stripped and aligned them in a hall, striking them with tennis balls. From that collaboration, he became involved in Cornelius Cardew's Scratch Orchestra. The first released recording in which Eno played is the Deutsche Grammophon edition of Cardew's The Great Learning (recorded February 1971), as one of <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recital of Paragraph 7 of The Great Learning.

An internal Pentagon report concluded that: [...] "affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar." [...] In January 2011, even Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a champion of the aircraft, voiced his frustration: [...] "The culture of endless money that has taken hold must {{be replaced by a}} culture of restraint"." [...] Tierney further noted that the F-35 is an old Cold War–concept aircraft intended for a war between major powers, and is no longer useful in the 21st century with its asymmetric warfare. He concluded: [...] "It's hard to square the military largesse with our rampant debt." ...|$|E
