5|$|After {{applying}} for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment {{for the new}} aircraft carrier , at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, {{until the end of}} December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board <b>the</b> <b>Monterey.</b> While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, {{as well as in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro.|$|E

5|$|When {{serving in}} the Hungarian Army, Bánáthy became {{interested}} in leadership development in boys and youth. In Monterey, he became Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay Area Council. He gained support for his concept of a leadership camp for boys from the Council Executive and Executive Board.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest and support of <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy briefly met fellow scout Joseph Szentkiralyi. Hungarian Sea Scouter Paul Ferenc Sujan's {{camp was}} visited by Baden-Powell, who asked to taste {{some of his}} soup. American Maury Tripp {{attended}} the Jamboree from Saratoga, California. These four Scouts would later play instrumental roles in forming the White Stag program on <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Peninsula. At {{the conclusion of the}} Jamboree, Baden-Powell gave a farewell speech in which he challenged the Scouts present to pursue the ideals represented by the White Stag.|$|E

5|$|After the fire, <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> was {{declared}} unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached Ulithi on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to Bremerton, Washington where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was {{detached from the}} ship {{and sent to the}} Navy Pre-Flight School at Saint Mary's College of California, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was {{on the staff of the}} Naval Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Discovered {{during the}} mapping of California's coast in 1933, Davidson Seamount {{is named after}} {{geographer}} George Davidson of the U.S. National Geodetic Survey.

Davidson Seamount is populated by a dense population of large, ancient corals, {{some of which are}} over 100 years of age. The data gathered during the studies fueled the making of Davidson Seamount into a part of <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The White Stag {{program is}} {{implemented}} by two 501(c)3 non-profits. The White Stag Leadership Development Academy {{is located on}} <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Peninsula and the White Stag Association {{is located in the}} San Francisco East Bay. Both are financially self-supporting. The programs are administered and managed by part-time adult volunteers. All participants, including youth and adult staff, pay fees to participate. Fees for participants attending the week-long summer camp are US$275–$325 in 2012. Candidate attendees to White Stag Sierra pay up to $320, while the Association in Monterey charges $335. , adult and youth staff volunteers paid about US$400 in fees {{over the course of a}} year of staff development.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} {{benthic species}} of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions {{for a year or}} more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, <b>the</b> <b>Monterey</b> Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E
