25|$|Athlete's foot, known {{medically}} as <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> is {{a common}} skin infection of the feet caused by fungus. Signs and symptoms often include itching, scaling, and redness. In severe cases the skin may blister. Athlete's foot fungus may infect {{any part of the}} foot, but most often grows between the toes. The next most common area is the bottom of the foot. The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands. It {{is a member of the}} group of diseases known as tinea.|$|E
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Athlete's foot {{is divided}} into four {{categories}} or presentations: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka [...] "moccasin foot"), acute ulcerative <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. [...] "Interdigital" [...] means between the toes. [...] "Plantar" [...] here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. [...] A vesiculobullous disease {{is a type of}} mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5–10mm and bulla being larger than 5–10mm, depending upon what definition is used).|$|E
50|$|Trichophyton rubrum {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of chronic <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> {{commonly}} known as athlete's foot. Chronic infections of <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> result in moccasin foot, in which the entire foot forms white scaly patches and infections usually affect both feet. Individuals with <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> are likely to have infection at multiple sites. Infections can be spontaneously cured or controlled by topical antifungal treatment. Although T. rubrum <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> in children is extremely rare, it has been reported in children as young as two years of age.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary to the name, <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> affects {{not solely}} athletes. <b>Tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> affects men more than women; {{it can be}} seen {{initially}} affecting the webs between the toes, before spreading to the sole of the foot in a [...] "moccasin" [...] pattern.|$|E

5000|$|For example, Ajoene {{has been}} shown to have {{activity}} against the human dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum, {{the most common cause of}} <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> commonly known as Athlete’s Foot. The specific mechanism of action is unclear, but is thought to be related to the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in human dermatophytes. In a randomized study by Ledezma et al. (2000), 70 soldiers from the Venezuelan Armed Forces with KOH or culture proven <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> interdigitalis were randomly distributed into 3 treatment groups: 0.6% ajoene, 1% ajoene, and 1% terbinafine (commercially available as Lamisil AT®) applied twice daily for 1 week. At the 60 day follow up, 72%, 100%, and 94% of the patients treated with 0.6% and 1% ajoene, and 1% terbinafine, respectively, had maintained culture-proven mycologic cure suggesting that short-term topical treatment with ajoene is at least as effective as topical terbinafine for treating <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Scytalidium dimidiatum is a <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> like {{infection}} {{resistant to}} most antifungals. it responds to cycloheximide ,so, {{it should be}} cultured in a medium free of cycloheximide.|$|E
50|$|Tolnaftate {{has been}} found to be {{generally}} slightly less effective than azoles when used to treat <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete's foot). It is, however, useful when dealing with ringworm, especially when passed from pets to humans.|$|E
50|$|Epidermophyton is a genus of fungus causing {{superficial}} and cutaneous mycoses, including E. floccosum, {{and causes}} tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch), <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete’s foot), and tinea unguium (fungal {{infection of the}} nail bed).|$|E
50|$|Butenafine is {{indicated}} for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, {{as well as}} athlete's foot (<b>Tinea</b> <b>pedis),</b> ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans.|$|E
50|$|As a {{cream or}} powder, {{it is used}} topically for {{superficial}} skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (<b>tinea</b> <b>pedis),</b> {{and other types of}} ringworm (tinea corporis). Terbinafine cream works in about half the time required by other antifungals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> {{is usually}} treated with topical medicines, like {{ketoconazole}} or terbinafine, and pills, or with medicines that contains miconazole, clotrimazole, or tolnaftate. Antibiotics {{may be necessary}} to treat secondary bacterial infections that occur in addition to the fungus (for example, from scratching).|$|E
5000|$|Tinea manuum (or tinea manus) is a fungal {{infection}} of the hand. [...] It is typically more aggressive than <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> but similar in look.

50|$|In randomized, double-blind, {{multicentre}} {{trials of}} 3-6 weeks' duration (n=127-383), {{a significantly greater}} number of patients with tinea of the glabrous skin and <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> receiving a topical 2% sertaconazole cream once or twice daily achieved a successful mycological cure compared with recipients of a placebo cream.|$|E
5000|$|... of infection: Erysipelas can recur in 18-30% {{of cases}} even after {{antibiotic}} treatment. A chronic state of recurrent erysipelas infections can occur with several predisposing factors including alcoholism, diabetes, and <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete's foot). Another predisposing factor is chronic cutaneous edema, such as can in turn {{be caused by}} venous insufficiency or heart failure.|$|E
50|$|Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton interdigitale cause athlete's foot (<b>tinea</b> <b>pedis),</b> toenail {{fungal infections}} (a.k.a. tinea unguium, a.k.a. onychomycosis), crotch itch (a.k.a. tinea cruris), and {{ringworm}} (a misnomer, {{as there is}} no worm involved; it is also known as tinea corporis). The fungi can easily spread to other areas of the body as well and to the host's home environs (socks, shoes, clothes, showers, bathtubs, counters, floors, carpets, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|... ==Indications for use== Ciclopirox is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> and tinea corporis due to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is not {{to be used in the}} eyes or vagina, and nursing women should consult their doctors before use, since it is not known whether ciclopirox passes into human milk. A burning sensation may be felt when first applying ciclopirox (Paddock Laboratories, Inc., Oct. 2009).|$|E
50|$|Other {{risk factors}} include perspiring heavily, {{being in a}} humid or moist environment, psoriasis, wearing socks and shoes that hinder {{ventilation}} and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having athlete's foot (<b>tinea</b> <b>pedis),</b> minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system.|$|E
5000|$|Athlete's foot (also {{known as}} [...] "ringworm of the foot", tinea pedum, and [...] "moccasin foot") {{is a common}} and {{contagious}} skin disease that causes itching, scaling, flaking, and sometimes blistering of the affected areas. Its medical name is <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> {{a member of the}} group of diseases or conditions known as tinea, most of which are dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin), which in turn are mycoses (broad category of fungal infections). Globally, athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population.|$|E

50|$|Once the fungal {{infection}} has been contracted, it invades hairs and sporulates {{in the hair}} shaft, causing it to burst and curl, creating a black dot on the scalp. Tinea capitis is the clinical disease, {{but it may also}} cause Tinea corporis, onychomycosis, and <b>Tinea</b> <b>pedis.</b> Cutaneous lesions due to T. tonsurans do not fluoresce under Wood's Lamp. Although some people may not show the symptoms of carrying T. tonsurans, it has a distinctive manifestation. During pathogenesis, the fungus undergoes protease elaboration to hydrolyze structural proteins (such as the keratin found in hair), and isolates show peak values between days 18-22 during the sporulation phase.|$|E
5000|$|Athlete's foot {{is divided}} into four {{categories}} or presentations: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka [...] "moccasin foot"), acute ulcerative <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. [...] "Interdigital" [...] means between the toes. [...] "Plantar" [...] here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders.

Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5-10 mm and bulla being larger than 5-10 mm, depending upon what definition is used).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> {{is caused}} by fungi such as Epidermophyton floccosum or fungi of the Trichophyton genus {{including}} T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. These fungi are typically transmitted in moist communal areas where people go barefoot, such as around swimming pools or in showers, and require a warm moist environment {{like the inside of}} a shoe to incubate. Fungal infection of the foot may be acquired (or reacquired) in many ways, such as by walking in an infected locker room, by using an infested bathtub, by sharing a towel used by someone with the disease, by touching the feet with infected fingers (such as after scratching another infected area of the body), or by wearing fungi-contaminated socks or shoes.|$|E
5000|$|Tinea manuum (or tinea manus) is a fungal {{infection}} of the hand. [...] It is typically more aggressive than <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> but similar in look. Itching, burning, cracking, and scaling are observable and may be transmitted sexually or otherwise, whether or not symptoms are present. Alternatively, it {{may be caused by}} an allergic reaction, known as a [...] "dermatophytid reaction". [...] "For example, a {{fungal infection}} on the foot may cause an itchy, bumpy rash to appear on the fingers. These eruptions (dermatophytids, or identity or id reactions) are allergic reactions to the fungus. They do not result from touching the infected area. The eruptions may appear on many different areas of the body at once." ...|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the locus and {{severity}} of infection. For <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown {{to be an effective}} treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. Terbinafine and naftifine (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum infections {{have been found to be}} susceptible to photodynamic treatment, laser irradiation, and photoactivation of rose bengal dye by green laser light.|$|E
50|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E
50|$|The fungus is {{the only}} {{pathogen}} of the two species comprising genus Epidermophyton. Hosts of the fungi are humans, wild animals, and domestic animals. The fungi can cause <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and onychomycosis. The infection spreads by contact, especially in gyms and showers. The infection can be stopped by bathing {{with soap and water}} and applying an appropriate fungicide. A study of 900 patients afflicted with E. floccosum infection investigating the contagious aspects of the fungus was conducted in Korea, from 1976 to 1997. The study found that fewer people were infected by E. floccosum than by other dermatophytes. The fungus may be transmitted between humans and squirrels. The fungi can usually only infect the nonliving cornified layers of epidermis. An invasive infection has, however, been recorded in an immunocompromised patient with Behçet's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Dermatophytes are {{a type of}} fungus that invades the {{top layer}} of the skin, hair, or nails. There are three genera of fungi {{commonly}} implicated: Trichophyton (found in skin, nail, and hair infections), Epidermophyton (skin and nail infections), and Microsporum (skin and hair infections).Dermatophytes produce an infection commonly known as ringworm or tinea. It can appear as [...] "jock itch" [...] in the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris); on the scalp and hair (tinea capitis) resulting in brittle hair shafts that fall out easily. Tinea unguium affects the nails and athletes foot (<b>tinea</b> <b>pedis)</b> affects the feet. Tinea versicolor refers to a fungal infection of the skin caused by Malassezia furfur. It appears anywhere on the skin and produces red or gray, scaly patches of itchy skin. Deeper infections may be discoloured, ulcerative and purulent.|$|E
50|$|Trichophyton rubrum {{is rarely}} {{isolated}} from animals. In humans, {{men are more}} often infected than women. Infections can manifest as both chronic and acute forms. Typically T. rubrum infections are restricted to the upper layers of the epidermis; however, deeper infections are possible. Approximately 80-93% of chronic dermatophyte infections {{in many parts of}} the developed world are thought to be caused by T. rubrum including cases of <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis,</b> tinea unguium, tinea manuum, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis, as well as some cases of tinea barbae. Trichophyton rubrum has also been known to cause folliculitis in which case it is characterized by fungal element in follicles and foreign body giant cells in the dermis. A T. rubrum infection may also form a granuloma. Extensive granuloma formations may occur in patients with immune deficiencies (e.g. Cushing syndrome). Immunodeficient neonates are susceptible to systemic T. rubrum infection.|$|E
50|$|Tinea infections, more {{commonly}} known as Ringworm, {{are the most common}} skin infections transmitted through wrestling. It is caused by parasitic fungi that survive on keratin, an organic material that is found in skin, hair, and nails. There are several varieties of Tinea, which are classified depending on their location. Tinea corporis is found on the body, tinea cruris (jock itch) on the groin, tinea capitis on the scalp, and <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> (athlete’s foot) on the foot. Although they are not harmful, they are highly contagious and difficult to treat. The symptoms of ringworm include patches of skin that are red, swollen, and irritated, forming the shape of a ring. Ringworm will last between two and four weeks with treatment. Tinea infections can be combatted orally or topically with numerous amount of different medications. Some topical treatments include Mentax 1%, Lamisil 1%, Naftin 1% and Spectazole and these creams should be applied two times a day until the infection is gone. Oral treaments for Tinea include Lamisil, Sporanox, and Diflucan.|$|E
5000|$|Strains of T. rubrum form two {{distinct}} biogeographical subpopulations. One is largely restricted {{to parts of}} Africa and southern Asia, while the other consists of a population that has spread around the world. Isolates of the Afro-Asiatic subpopulation most commonly manifest clinically as tinea corporis and tinea capitis. In contrast, the globally-distributed subpopulation manifests predominantly in <b>tinea</b> <b>pedis</b> and tinea unguium. Different members of the T. rubrum complex are endemic to different regions; isolates previously referred to T. megninii originate from Portugal, while T. soudanense and T. gourvilii are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. All species included in the T. rubrum complex are [...] "-" [...] mating type {{with the exception of}} T. megninii which represents the [...] "+" [...] mating type and is auxotrophic for L-histidine. The mating type identity of T. soudanense remains unknown. Trichophyton raubitschekii, which is common from northwestern India and southeast Asia as well as parts of West Africa, is characterized by strongly granular colonies and is the only variant in the complex that reliably produces urease.|$|E
