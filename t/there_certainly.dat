They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> are no lengthy appeals.|$|E

Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.|$|E

Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs — his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Bey of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship. This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.|$|E

500|$|After the {{discovery}} of prehistoric rock art on Stonehenge in 1953, Crawford decided to examine the engravings on the megalithic monuments in Brittany. Inspired by this subject, in 1957 he published The Eye Goddess. In this book he argued {{that many of the}} abstract designs featured in prehistoric rock art were representations of eyes. He further argued that they provided evidence for a religion devoted to a mother goddess which had existed across the Old World from the Palaeolithic through to the period of Christianisation. That same decade also witnessed similar ideas regarding a Neolithic religion focused around a great goddess being espoused in the works of Childe and Daniel; the historian Ronald Hutton later observed that [...] "whether or not there was ever an 'Age of the Goddess' in Neolithic Europe, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> was one among European intellectuals in the mid twentieth century". Crawford's book was not well received within academia.|$|E
500|$|According to McDougall, another {{director}} was originally hired {{to work on}} the episode but quit after learning casting would be a group decision. Filming took place over thirteen days in March 2004. During filming, McDougall suggested removing references to pop culture from the script to ensure the pilot had [...] "more of a timeless feel." [...] ABC picked up the series for 13 episodes on May 18, 2004. In June, ABC called for three starring cast members to be recast. Jesse Metcalfe replaced Searles as John Rowland, as producers wanted to add more sexual appeal to the role [...] "to justify why (Gabrielle) was having an affair." [...] Metcalfe had previously read for the role during the initial casting process. The role of Rex Van de Kamp was given to Steven Culp, who was Cherry's first choice for the part but was unavailable when the original pilot was filmed. Brenda Strong took over the role of Mary Alice, as producers thought that Lee was not right for the part. Strong commented on the casting change for her character, explaining, [...] "I think it was a conceptual shift... <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate." [...] Scenes featuring the original actors were refilmed with their replacements, however Burke and Searles are present in the background of some scenes in the final cut of the episode.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} and varied {{reaction}} to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of [...] "the impact of that moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of the most important issues of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American art {{collector}} Walter Conrad Arensberg (1878–1954) {{believed that}} Bacon had concealed messages {{in a variety}} of ciphers, relating to a secret history of the time and the esoteric secrets of the Rosicrucians, in the Shakespearean works. [...] He published a variety of decipherments between 1922 and 1930, concluding finally that, although he had failed to find them, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> were concealed messages.

2500|$|William Muir, {{like many}} other 19th century {{scholars}} divides Muhammad's life into two periods – Meccan and Medinan. He asserts that [...] "in the Meccan period of [...] life <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> can be traced no personal ends or unworthy motives," [...] painting {{him as a man}} of good faith and a genuine reformer. However, that all changed after the Hijra, according to Muir. [...] "There [...] temporal power, aggrandisement, and self-gratification mingled rapidly with the grand object of the Prophet's life, and they were sought and attained by just the same instrumentality." [...] From that point on, he accuses Muhammad of manufacturing [...] "messages from heaven" [...] in order to justify a lust for women and reprisals against enemies, among other sins.|$|E

Beneath a genial manner <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> lay steely determination {{and a fair}} degree of ruthlessness." [...] Under his leadership, the Savoy group successfully fought off several hostile takeover bids using, on occasion, controversial stratagems to defeat the bidder. In 1953 the entrepreneur Charles Clore attempted to buy the Savoy group, and when his bid was rejected he sold his shares to the property developer Harold Samuel, who planned to redevelop the Piccadilly site of the Berkeley Hotel. Wontner temporarily transferred possession of the freehold of the Berkeley from the Savoy group to its staff pension fund until the bid was withdrawn.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Cow's {{music was}} {{challenging}} and uncompromising and this often led to them {{being accused of}} deliberately making their music inaccessible. As a result, they were virtually ignored in their own country. Even Virgin Records, who had started dropping experimental groups in favour of commercial ones, was now showing little to no interest in Henry Cow. This led to the group having to continuously make decisions as to whether to continue or not (<b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> were no economic inducements). Cutler said, [...] "We had to make what amounted to political decisions about {{the organization of the}} group and its relation to the commercial structures, and this was bound to be reflected in the music too." [...] Henry Cow's anti-capitalist stance was brought on partly out of necessity rather than choice. They began working outside the music industry and doing everything for themselves. They abandoned agencies and managers and stopped looking for approval from the music press. Henry Cow quickly became self-sufficient and self-reliant.|$|E
