5|$|In 1215 William {{joined the}} baronial {{rebellion}} against John, {{and lost his}} naval offices, the royal forester's office for Somerset, and custody of Lydford Castle. In May 1216 the king offered William a safe conduct, which noted that William had fled overseas. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> witnessed by Peter des Roches. In mid-1217, he rejoined the royalist cause, returning {{to the side of}} Henry III. This action regained him some of his lost lands.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|In 2017 it was {{revealed}} that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> sent to Dr. Ruth Barnhouse (then Dr. Ruth Beuscher).|$|E

5|$|Many of Neville's letters survive, as {{they were}} {{collected}} by him during his lifetime. They are currently in the National Archives of the United Kingdom, having previously formed part of the Public Record Office. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> published in Sussex Archaeological Collections volume 3 in 1850 and were edited by William Henry Blaauw. Neville was instrumental in promoting the career of his brother William, but non-relatives also benefited from his patronage: one of Neville's clerks, Silvester de Everdon, {{was a member of}} the chancery until 1246, when he was selected as Bishop of Carlisle.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} late in White's life, compiled from a mixture of his letters to other naturalists — Thomas Pennant and Daines Barrington; a 'Naturalist's Calendar' (in the second edition) comparing phenology observations made by White and William Markwick of the first appearances {{in the year of}} different animals and plants; and observations of natural history organized more or less systematically by species and group. A second volume, less often reprinted, covered the antiquities of Selborne. Some of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> never posted, and were written for the book.|$|E
5|$|The letters Η, Μ, Ν, and Π, are square, {{the letters}} Ε, Θ, Ο, Σ, and Φ have a round shape. The letters Δ, Ε, Θ, Ο, and {{especially}} Ψ in cruciform, {{are of the}} form characteristic for the late uncial script. Φ is large and bevelled at both ends. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> written by an 'elegant and careful' hand.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> {{addressed}} to <b>the</b> newspapers Pravda, Rahva Hääl and Sovetskaya Estoniya.

5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that either the documents were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters, or that <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy points out that the letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> {{used in some}} {{transliteration}} {{systems of}} South Asian languages. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> used in <b>the</b> International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration for the [...] "ng" [...] sound corresponding to <b>the</b> Indian <b>letters</b> ङ / ঙ / ਙ / ઙ / ଙ / ங / ఙ / ಙ / ങ / ඞ. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> also used in the ISO 9 transliteration of <b>the</b> Cyrillic <b>letter</b> Ҥ.|$|R

50|$|Biblical {{scholars}} are in general agreement that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> indeed written by Paul of Tarsus. The estimated date of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> 62 AD, about 10 years after Paul's {{first visit to}} Philippi.|$|R
5|$|The crop produce {{from these}} {{plantations}} were generally exported {{to other countries}} from Singapore {{with the assistance of}} Chinese merchants based in that city. From the 1860s onwards, many of these Kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates (Kongsi in Teochew) based in Singapore, who were known to the locals as Tuan Sungai (literally Masters of the River). The Kangchu then were often hired as supervisors or managers by the merchants to keep watch on the day-to-day operations of the gambier and pepper plantations. Temenggong Abu Bakar began to issue contract-style letters of recognition to these Kangchu; <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> known by their Malay name Surat Tauliah.|$|E
5|$|While traveling, Einstein wrote {{daily to}} his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> {{included}} in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to {{be made available to}} the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear that the author had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either a family member or courtier.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> {{not made}} public, {{and it became}} {{publicly}} known only after Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, tweeted out an image of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>the</b> day after <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> written. Along {{with the image of}} <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> she wrote [...] "Pence and Kobach are laying the groundwork for voter suppression, plain & simple."

5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder of Helen Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives of Helen Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have access to some of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained the letters in 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with the murder weapon, in the newspaper's office window.|$|E
