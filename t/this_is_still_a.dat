5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{attendance}} {{recorded at}} Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for the 1937 British Home Championship tie between Scotland and England. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> European record {{for an international}} match. The 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, a world record for a club match, with 20,000 more people locked outside. Hampden set world attendance records that year that were only surpassed by the Maracanã, and it still holds all the major European records. The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.|$|E

25|$|The {{tip of a}} {{scanning}} probe {{can also be used}} to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). Feature-oriented scanning methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.

25|$|The , or Castilian Grammar Intended for the Use by Americans (Americans {{referring}} to Castilian- or Spanish-speaking {{inhabitants of the}} Americas), finished in 1847, was the first Spanish-American Grammar, with many original contributions, a product of long years of study. Republished over the years with many revisions, the most significant of which are by Rufino Jose Cuervo, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> valuable reference work.

25|$|His {{greatest}} {{performance as}} a player, however, came in January 2000 when England played Zimbabwe in the fifth match of a triangular tournament held in South Africa.

Even more remarkable is that all five wickets were LBWs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> record in one-day international cricket.|$|E
25|$|Long ago, just as today, woodworkers {{required}} a more helpful {{way to keep}} the wood in place while it was being worked. A device was needed that could be used effectively on different sizes of wood. Probably the first such device used two stops - at least one of which was adjustable for position - and wedges between them and the work to fix it in place. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> cheap and effective method for holding the work.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric State of Mexico, the Tepexpan Man is an {{important}} finding for Mexican and foreign anthropologists; it is {{an important}} key to understand what the Valley of Mexico area was like, 5000 years ago, as well as helping establish the occupation chronology of the region. Currently some scholars attribute an age of 11 thousand years, others 8 thousand, and some have suggested 5 thousand years old. This individual was originally identified as a male, but recent research confirms a female identity, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> subject of discussion.|$|E

25|$|Tubal {{ligation}} is protective because carcinogens {{are unable}} to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes. Tubal ligation is also protective in women with the BRCA1 mutation, but not the BRCA2 mutation. Hysterectomy reduces the risk, and removal of both Fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) dramatically {{reduces the risk of}} not only ovarian cancer, but breast cancer as well. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> topic of research, as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial. The reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Vertebral subluxation, a core {{concept of}} {{traditional}} chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and {{a debate about}} whether {{to keep it in}} the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an evidence-based chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Ireland {{defines the}} Irish {{diaspora}} as all persons of Irish nationality who habitually reside {{outside of the}} island of Ireland. This includes Irish citizens who have emigrated abroad and their children, who are Irish citizens by descent under Irish law. It also includes their grandchildren in cases where they were registered as Irish citizens in the Foreign Births Register held in every Irish diplomatic mission. (Great-grandchildren and even more distant descendants of Irish immigrants may also register as Irish citizens, {{but only if the}} parent through whom they claim descent was registered as a citizen before the descendant in question was born.) Under this legal definition, the Irish diaspora is considerably smaller—some 3 million persons, of whom 1.2 million are Irish-born emigrants. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> large ratio for any country.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E
25|$|One {{variation}} {{in the design of}} trousers is the use or not of pleats. The most classic style of trouser is to have two pleats, usually forward, since this gives more comfort sitting and better hang standing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> common style, and for these reasons of utility has been worn throughout the 20th century. The style originally descended from the exaggeratedly widened Oxford bags worn in the 1930s in Oxford, which, though themselves short-lived, began a trend for fuller fronts. The style is still seen as the smartest, featuring on dress trousers with black and white tie. However, at various periods throughout the last century, flat fronted trousers with no pleats have been worn, and the swing in fashions has been marked enough that the more fashion-oriented ready-to-wear brands have not produced both types continuously.|$|E
