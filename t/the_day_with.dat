5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> only {{the tips of}} their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on the system that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system.|$|E

40|$|Looking {{through the}} history, {{people have always}} been associating suicide with weather conditions, trying to {{understand}} and identify the relationship between meteorological factors and suicide. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine and analyze the meteorological conditions in the time of attempted or committed suicides, and examine the possible link between the changes of meteorological factors and the frequency of suicidal behavior. Retrospective study of pairs covered the period from January 2003 to January 2006. Examinees included in the study were persons who committed or attempted suicide in the region of Mostar. Meteorological factors included <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of attempts or committing of suicide, with meteorological factors of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> immediately prior to <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of attempts or committing of suicide, as well as with average monthly values of meteorological factors. Meteorological factors of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>with</b> suicidal behavior were similar to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> prior to <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>with</b> suicidal behavior, but there was significant difference between meteorological factors of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>with</b> suicidal behavior and average monthly values of meteorological factors: maximum pressure was significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>with</b> suicidal risk, as well as pressure gradient. Regarding the seasonal periods, examinees most frequently attempted to commit suicide in April. Results indicate that meteorological factors do not act as an acute stress factor for suicide behavior, but its change over time may be the trigger for a suicide attempt...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident.
