40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} considers the problem of excessive originating and <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges imposed by some competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) in the United States. The problem arises because the current institutional structure provides an incentive for CLECs to charge for access service in excess of what a competitive market would indicate. An examination of the data shows {{that the problem of}} excessive access charges imposed by CLECs is very real. An analysis of <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges for September 2000 reveals that average <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges billed to three interexchange carriers (IXCs) are excessive, exceeding average price cap regulated incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) access charges by 370 - 470 percent. Some solutions to the problem are offered including a first-best solution whereby the calling party would be required to pay for originating access service and have the receiving party pay for <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> service. A second-best solution would be to limit CLEC's access charges to an IXC to be {{less than or equal to}} the access charges of the ILEC with which it directly competes for customers.

40|$|Policymakers {{have long}} invoked {{the concept of}} a “terminating access monopoly” to inform {{communications}} policy. Roughly speaking, the concept holds that a consumer-facing network provider, no matter how small or how subject to retail competition, generally possesses monopoly power vis-à-vis third-party senders of communications traffic to its customers. Regulators and advocates have routinely cited that concern to justify regulatory intervention in a variety of contexts where the regulated party {{may or may not have}} possessed market power in any relevant retail market. Despite the centrality of the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> monopoly to modern communications policy, there is surprisingly little academic literature on that concept as it applies to current regulatory debates. This paper seeks to fill that gap by exploring the various settings in which the concept does, or does not, help explain market dynamics in the communications sector. We conclude that the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> monopoly phenomenon, strictly understood, does not itself generally threaten market failures except in very limited circumstances. As the paper explains, the phenomenon could threaten inefficient outcomes only where, because of the underlying market context, the interconnecting provider or its customer has a particularized need to reach the customer set of the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> provider, and even then, market forces might correct any problem without regulatory intervention...|$|R

METHODS: Literature review performed on latino children and health insurance coverage, key informant interviews with frontline service providers, review of outreach sections of eight state 1115 waiver requests approved by the Secretary of the U. S.

RESULTS: Eligibility and enrollment into Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) are hindered by financial, nonfinancial, and social policy barriers.

40|$|Introduction. This {{study used}} three {{dependent}} measures of food security {{to assess the}} magnitude of household food insecurity and its consequences on the nutritional status of children 6 – 36 months in Tamale Metropolis of Northern Ghana. Methods. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 337 mother/child pairs in June 2012. Food access was measured as household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS), household dietary diversity score (HDDS), and food consumption score (FCS). Results. The magnitude of household food insecurity depended on the food <b>access</b> <b>indicator,</b> with HFIAS yielding the highest household food insecurity of 54 %. Of the three food <b>access</b> <b>indicators,</b> 30 -day HFIAS {{was not related to}} any of the nutrition indices measured. HDDS and FCS were both significantly associated with BMI of mothers and chronic malnutrition (stunted growth) but not acute malnutrition (wasting) with FCS being a stronger predictor of nutritional status. Compared to children in food insecure households, children in food secure households were 46 % protected from chronic malnutrition (, 95 % CI: 0. 31 – 0. 94). Conclusions and Recommendations. The results of this study show that different measures of household food insecurity produce varied degree of the problem.

The four indicators represent participation in outdoor play, satisfaction with local play spaces, quality of local play spaces, and accessibility to local play spaces. Six pilot authorities {{agreed to participate in}} the feasibility study, including five from metropolitan (mainly urban) councils and one from a district (more rural) council. The methods employed to generate the performance data comprised household surveys, surveys of children and young people via schools, professional assessment of play space quality using a standard assessment tool, audits and mapping of local play spaces, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results suggest that three of the indicators are suitable for national comparisons, but the quality indicator is only suitable for local management purposes. The participation indicator should be constructed using a household survey and the satisfaction indicator from an online survey of children and young people via schools. The audit and mapping data assembled for the <b>access</b> <b>indicator</b> proved more useful for local performance management than the <b>access</b> <b>indicator</b> itself.
