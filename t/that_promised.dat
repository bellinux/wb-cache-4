5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> to defend the gold standard, limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, re{{gained control of}} the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.|$|E

You can say 'I broke <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>that</b> was so important to you,' but it's even worse to break a <b>promise</b> <b>that's</b> only important to whoever made the promise." ...|$|R

5|$|In Philadelphia, Adams {{promoted}} colonial unity {{while using}} his political skills to lobby other delegates. On September 16, messenger Paul Revere brought Congress the Suffolk Resolves, {{one of many}} resolutions passed in Massachusetts <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> strident resistance to the Coercive Acts.

5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing strategy <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> free and unlimited live-telephone support on certain products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple to rescind the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E

5|$|Having led Olimpia to the 1979 {{title as}} manager, Luis Cubilla {{returned}} to the club in 1988. With the legendary goalkeeper Ever Hugo Almeida, Gabriel González, Adriano Samaniego, and star Raul Vicente Amarilla, a rejuvenated decano boasted a formidable side <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> {{a return to the}} glory days of the late 1970s. After coming up short in 1989 against Atlético Nacional, Olimpia reached the 1990 Copa Libertadores finals after defeating the defending champion in a climactic semifinal series decided on penalties. In the finals, Olimpia defeated Barcelona of Ecuador 3–1 in aggregate to win their second title. Olimpia reached the 1991 Copa Libertadores finals, once again, defeating Atlético Nacional in the semifinals and facing Colo-Colo of Chile in the final. Led by Yugoslavian coach Mirko Jozić, the Chilean squad beat the defending champion 3–0. The defeat brought Olimpia's second golden era to a close.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Abdalá Bucaram, {{from the}} populist Ecuadorian Roldosista Party, won the {{presidency}} on a platform <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> populist economic and social reforms. Almost from the start, Bucaram's administration languished amidst widespread allegations of corruption. Empowered by the president's unpopularity with organized labor, business, and professional organizations alike, Congress unseated Bucaram in February 1997 on grounds of mental incompetence. The Congress replaced Bucaram with Interim President Fabián Alarcón.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, the Liberal party, led by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, won an {{overwhelming}} victory {{on a platform}} <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> social reforms for the working class.

At the same time, however, the Conservative Party had a huge majority in the Lords; it could easily veto any legislation passed by the Commons that was against their interests.|$|E

25|$|The playwright Ion Luca Caragiale was {{a friend}} of mayor Condeescu, whom he parodied in his work; the latter's conversations with Caragiale and with Mihai Eminescu's brother Matei, a soldier {{assigned}} to Mizil and who became the mayor's brother-in-law, convinced him to build a theatre. It had 200 seats and opened in 1895; among the plays staged were Caragiale's. After falling into a state of degradation, it was demolished in 1968. A cinema used to operate in Mizil; this was sold to a company <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> to continue screening films but did not do so.|$|E
25|$|Realizing that {{increasing}} numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch, Boeing introduced Connexion by Boeing, a satellite based Internet connectivity service <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web. The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005, receiving generally favorable reviews. However, facing competition from cheaper options, such as cellular networks, it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines. In August 2006, after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business, Boeing chose to discontinue the service.|$|E

Arthur agreed to star in a film, Whirlpool (1934), and during production she was offered a long-term contract <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> financial stability for both her and her parents. Even though hesitant to give up her stage career, Arthur signed the five-year contract on February 14, 1934.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Civil War {{involved}} {{large numbers}} of non-Spanish citizens who participated in combat and advisory positions. Britain and France led a political alliance of 27 nations <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, including an embargo on all arms to Spain. The United States unofficially went along. Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed on officially, but ignored the embargo. The attempted suppression of imported materiel was largely ineffective, however, and France especially was accused of allowing large shipments to Republican troops. The clandestine actions of the various European powers were, at the time, considered to be risking another world war, alarming antiwar elements across the world.|$|E
