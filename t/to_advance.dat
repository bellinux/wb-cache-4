5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
