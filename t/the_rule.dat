30|$|Then {{what happens}} when {{operating}} rules are less than perfect and things go wrong? This {{is exactly what the}} hierarchy is to do: interfere when things go wrong, i.e., the appeals of decisions (Weber, p. 197). That is, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> are not complete in the Baligh (2006) sense: not everyone knows <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> or follows them; <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> do not fit <b>the</b> situation; <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> may be incomplete; <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> may be inconsistent, no one is assigned to change <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> are imperfect, and the hierarchy is a mechanism to deal with this situation. This organization might work in a very stable situation where there are no exceptions or variations, no change, and no new strategy which requires new rules or specializations. It is an idealized world which is rare—temporary at best.|$|R

5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action.

The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated {{because there were no}} evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'.

500|$|In 1924, Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) {{was formed}} and in 1929 it {{took up the}} task of {{standardizing}} <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules, but translations to various languages differed slightly. Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control, some countries continued {{to use their own}} rules internally [...] In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> of Chess (also known as <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> Commission) and published a new edition of <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> third official edition of the laws was published in 1966.

5|$|Democracy, or <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of {{the many}} over themselves. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> of the masses is positive, {{in that it is}} less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.|$|E
