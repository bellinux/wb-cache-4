5|$|While head of <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> city organization, Khrushchev superintended {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks {{in the construction}} and {{spent much of his}} time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction. Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow oblast, a province with a population of 11million.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} film's release, Prokofiev {{received}} {{an invitation from}} <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> Radio Symphony Orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his Kijé film music—probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work.

Gusman was a strong supporter of Prokofiev's ambition to rehabilitate himself in the Soviet Union, and had negotiated with <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> orchestra for a series of concerts that would showcase the returned composer's talent.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first {{appeared to be in}} shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of the}} Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who {{came out with a}} political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of <b>the</b> <b>Moscow</b> Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
