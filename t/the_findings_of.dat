5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It {{was based on}} post cranial {{material}} from Portugal. In 1990 this material was reassigned to Camarasaurus, but in 1998 it was given its own genus, Lourinhasaurus. This was further supported by <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> Tschopp etal. in 2015, where Lourinhasaurus {{was found to be}} sister to Camarasaurus and other camarasaurids.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning.

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did {{not plan}} another search of its own.

5|$|Still, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other pro-Soviet Russian {{politicians}} and commentators, continue to deny all Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, insist that the original Soviet version—Polish prisoners were shot by Germans in August 1941—is the correct one, and call on the Russian government to start a new investigation that would revise <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the one concluded in 2004.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the DOJ {{investigation in}} Cleveland on December 4, 2014.

5|$|As on {{most large}} warships, {{there have been}} several {{incidents}} involving the death or injury of one or more crew members, although most have involved freak accidents or failures, such as a man overboard as a result of poor weather. One of the highest-profile incidents was on 26 May 1981, when an EA-6B Prowler crashed on the flight deck of Nimitz, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. Forensic testing of the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this in itself was not found to have directly caused the crash, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the investigation prompted the introduction of mandatory drug testing of all service personnel.|$|E

5|$|Based on <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> {{these and}} other studies in the early 1970s, the current {{consensus}} is {{that the use of}} methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church.

5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} depart from <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> a 2005 study, which pegged {{the mean age}} of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> a 2012 Cochrane systematic review {{does not justify}} the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury.

HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long-distance country rail {{services}} previously {{run by the}} government-owned operator V/Line {{to private}} operators. While several rail services were replaced by road coach services, West Coast Railway successfully tendered to operate the railway line to Warrnambool, becoming the first private operator in Victoria. In 1993 Professor Fred Hilmer presented <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the National Competition Policy Review Committee, known as the Hilmer Report, leading {{to the introduction of}} National Competition Policy in 1995.

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years.

5|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Institut Laue–Langevin, Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the neutron magnetic moment and finding a limit to its electric dipole moment.

He also headed a 1982 National Research Council committee that concluded that, contrary to <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, that acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman's involvement in the assassination of President John F.
