5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement {{are more important than}} marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of}} their objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people in}} the dress circle, {{familiar}} with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street.

To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building.

500|$|Blow {{recognized}} that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, {{and did not have}} any set difficulty curve. He designed most of the game's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles, allowing them to experience the rest of the game even if they could not solve a difficult puzzle. Only certain boss fights require the player to defeat the enemy character before continuing on, using a combination of the time mechanics. Blow hoped that players would be able to find solutions to puzzles they had skipped by completing puzzles later in the game. Blow felt that [...] "unearned rewards are false and meaningless", and thus included collectibles earned only after solving a puzzle. He strongly discouraged players from using a walkthrough <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through Braid, instead encouraging players to solve them on their own so that they [...] "will feel very good about" [...] completing the puzzles without help; Blow created his own official [...] "walkthrough" [...] that guides the player but instead restates his insistence that the player work through the puzzles on their own.

2500|$|The CMP has a {{point system}} that {{competitors}} use <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> towards [...] "distinguished status."

[...] Once the minimum cut score has been achieved or exceeded (260-300 for [...]22 rimfire pistol, 250-300 for service pistol, and 455-500 for service rifle), the shooter becomes eligible to earn leg points. [...] The number of leg points that can be earned {{are based on the}} number of competitors, one's score, one's ranking, and you must fall within the top 10% of all match shooters regardless of your minimum cut score.

[...] Everyone must earn at least 30 leg points to reach [...] "distinguished status" [...] and be awarded one of the distinguished marksmanship badges. [...] Leg points accumulate throughout a competitor's lifetime until [...] "distinguished status" [...] is attained.

At 18:00 hours, while Weidling and his staff {{finalized}} their breakout plans in the Bendlerblock, three regiments of the Soviet 150th Rifle Division, under cover of a heavy artillery barrage and closely supported by tanks, assaulted the Reichstag. All the windows were bricked up, but the soldiers managed to force the main doors and entered the main hall. The German garrison, of about 1,000 defenders (a mixture of sailors, SS and Hitler Youth) fired down on the Soviets from above, turning the main hall into a medieval style killing field.

Close combat raged throughout the night and the coming day of 1 May, until the evening when some German troops pulled out of the building and crossed the FriedrichstraÃŸe S-Bahn Station, where they moved into the ruins hours before the main breakout across the Spree.
