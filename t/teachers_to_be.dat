25|$|A Latin {{mnemonic}} verse or mnemonic rhyme is a mnemonic {{device for}} teaching and remembering Latin grammar. Such mnemonics have been considered by <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an effective technique for schoolchildren to learn the complex rules of Latin accidence and syntax. One of their earliest uses was in the Doctrinale by Alexander of Villedieu written in 1199 as an entire grammar of the language comprising 2,000 lines of doggerel verse. Various Latin mnemonic verses continued {{to be used in}} English schools until the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Though Braille {{is thought}} to be the main way blind people read and write, in Britain (for example) out of the {{reported}} 2 million blind and low vision population, it is estimated that only around 15–20 thousand people use braille.

A debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available to teach it.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sources have}} {{discussed}} {{a double standard}} regarding the conduct of female versus male teachers. When it comes to sexual harassment or sexual abuse cases involving a male teacher as the perpetrator to a female student, severe punishments are often the result. According to David Ring, a lawyer working with sexual abuse cases, {{it is not uncommon}} for the male <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> convicted, face jail time, or owe partial civil damages to the student victim depending on the severity of the case. When a female teacher is the perpetrator of sexual harassment to a male student, there are arguments that the female teachers are given lighter sentences and the male victims are given lower amounts of compensation due to the reasoning that teenage males would be willing to have sexual encounters with older, female teachers as a response to changes in their hormones.|$|E

50|$|Making use of translanguaging in the {{classroom}} {{does not require the}} <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bilingual; however, it does require the <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a co-learner. Monolingual teachers working with bilingual or multilingual students can successfully utilize this teaching practice; however, they must rely on the students, their parents, the community, texts, and technology more than the bilingual <b>teacher,</b> in order <b>to</b> support the learning, and leverage the students’ existing resources. As translanguaging allows the legitimization of all varieties, teachers can participate by being open to learning the varieties of their students, and by incorporating words from unfamiliar languages into their own use, serving as a model for their students to begin working with their non-native languages.|$|R

Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overly strict.

They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else."

Diderot, however, with his usual boundless good nature, took the trouble to set the book in a series of dialogues, in which teacher, pupil, and a philosopher deal in all kinds of elaborate amenities, and pay one another many compliments.
