5|$|<b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problem</b> was not solved: Joseph's {{foreign policy}} {{dictated}} {{the expansion of}} Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E

She criticised the film, however, for the [...] "strong impression" [...] it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problem</b> and for several differences between Leigh's murder and the film that she considered to be disrespectful to Leigh's memory, in particular the film's [...] "Hollywood ending".|$|E

Results include a determination that the school sequesters conflict, instead of addressing <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problems</b> which create it. <b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problems</b> creating conflict at the school are: employee lack of general knowledge about the student population, subpar communication skills in students, a lack of female role models for female students, lack of conflict role models for all students, {{and a lack of}} training in adult-to-student conflict.

2500|$|Although the P versus NP {{problem was}} {{formally}} defined in 1971, there were previous inklings {{of the problems}} involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences. [...] In 1955, mathematician John Nash {{wrote a letter to}} the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key. [...] If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what we today would call P≠NP, since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problem</b> occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. [...] Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time, and pointed out one of the most important consequences—that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} 13 years, the Peter Jones {{business}} was not profitable – no dividends were paid to Lewis and the external shareholders [...] and in desperation, in 1914 Lewis appointed his son Spedan {{as chairman of}} Peter Jones. This gave Spedan Lewis complete control, and he decided that <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>problem</b> was that the staff had no incentive {{to do a good}} day's work, because their own interests were not in line with those of the business. He shortened their working day and instituted a system of commission for each department, paying selling staff amounts based on turnover. He held regular meetings at which staff could air any grievances directly with him. [...] In 1916, after a disagreement with his father, Spedan Lewis exchanged his 25 per cent interest in the Oxford Street business for Lewis's shares in Peter Jones Limited. He made improvements in staff conditions, including granting a third week's paid holiday each year. He had hot and cold running water installed in the staff bedrooms over the shop. In 1918, he started publishing a fortnightly newspaper telling staff how the business was faring. In 1919, he instituted a staff council, the first decision of which was that staff should be paid weekly instead of four-weekly. Business prospered: there was a profit of £20,000 in 1920. Spedan Lewis's radical idea was that the profits generated by business should not be paid solely to shareholders as a reward for their capital. Shareholders should receive a reasonable but limited return, and labour should be the recipient of the excess. His concept of 'fairer shares' involved sharing gain, knowledge and power. In 1920, Spedan started distributing Peter Jones preference shares to staff, who were now called 'Partners'.|$|E
