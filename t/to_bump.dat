5|$|Lucas Goodwin is {{released}} from prison and, seeking revenge for Barnes' death, shoots Underwood at a campaign rally, hitting him in the liver. He also mortally wounds Meechum, who manages to kill him before succumbing to his injuries. Underwood is {{rushed to the hospital}} for immediate surgery, and falls into a coma. It is soon discovered that he needs a liver transplant. Stamper manages <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> him {{to the top of the}} transplant list, and he survives. Once he recovers, he agrees to let Claire run as his vice president.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E

50|$|Time locks, {{combination}} locks, electronic locks, electromagnetic locks, {{and locks}} using rotating disks, such as disc tumbler locks, are inherently invulnerable to this attack, since their mechanism {{does not contain}} springs. However, some electronic locks feature a key backup that is susceptible <b>to</b> <b>bumping.</b> Warded locks are not vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>bumping,</b> but they are vulnerable to a similar attack called a skeleton key, {{which is also a}} filed-down key.|$|R

5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E

Bowl at the wicket.' Snow did just that next ball and took Redpath's leg stump – around behind his legs. Three for 269.|$|E
25|$|On {{its second}} drive of the game, Michigan drove 63 yards for the game's first touchdown. The drive {{featured}} a 21-yard pass from Chappuis <b>to</b> <b>Bump</b> Elliott and a 17-yard gain to the nine-yard line on a pass from Chappuis to Dick Rifenburg. Weisenburger {{ran for the}} touchdown from the one-yard line, and Jim Brieske kicked the PAT. In the second quarter, Michigan increased its lead on a drive featuring a 23-yard gain to the 10-yard line on a pass from Chappuis to Gene Derricotte. Weisenburger again ran it in from the one-yard line with Brieske again kicking the PAT. Late in the second quarter, a 52-yard punt by Weisenburger pinned the Trojans inside their one-yard line. USC punted, giving Michigan good field position. They scored on a drive that featured a 27-yard gain on a pass from Chappuis <b>to</b> <b>Bump</b> Elliott and a 16-yard run by Chappuis, and concluded with an 11-yard jump pass from Chappuis to Elliott. Brieske converted his third PAT, and Michigan led 21-0 at halftime.|$|E

25|$|As {{the segment}} {{came to a}} close, the {{attention}} focused on Graham Rahal, Josef Newgarden and Simona de Silvestro. All three were among the drivers attempting to make the top 24 for the day. Rahal was too slow to make the field, while de Silvestro managed <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> her way in. In the last 30 minutes, Townsend Bell made two attempts, the second of which bumped his way in. With time running out, Newgarden was bumped out by James Jakes. Newgarden ran out {{of time to get}} back in line to make an attempt, and would have to wait until Sunday to qualify.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} {{week of the}} season, Michigan {{traveled}} to Champaign, Illinois for Illinois' homecoming game. For the second straight week, Michigan won by a narrow margin 14-7. Late in the first quarter, Michigan took a 7-0 lead on a 74-yard punt return by Bump Elliott and a PAT by Jim Brieske. Illinois tied {{the game in the}} second quarter on a run by Russ Steger. Michigan's winning touchdown was set up by a 52-yard passing play from Bob Chappuis <b>to</b> <b>Bump</b> Elliott. Elliott was tackled the four-yard line, and Fonde ran for the touchdown. Brieske again converted the PAT. Neither team scored in the second half.|$|E

Menard also won his first Busch Series race on June 24 at his home track of the Milwaukee Mile by holding off a late race charge and bump from Cup regular Kevin Harvick. Harvick eventually caused a multi-car wreck attempting <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> {{him out of the}} way. Menard finished off 2006 with a sixth-place finish in the standings, tying his best finish in the standings last year (2005). He scored 16 top-10 finishes and 7 top-5 finishes in the Busch Series.|$|E

25|$|The ninth {{round of}} the season was the European Grand Prix and Montoya held pole for most of {{qualifying}} only for both Michael and Ralf Schumacher <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> him down to third in the final seconds. At {{the start of the}} race, he kept third and ran three seconds behind the two leaders. After the first round of stops, the two leaders came ahead of the one-stopping David Coulthard but Montoya came behind. He was stuck there for five laps and it cost him three seconds. He was forced to settle for third and that became second when Ralf was given a ten-second, stop-and-go penalty for a pitlane infringement. Montoya finished in second, and the result gave him more confidence than ever.|$|E

25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> his head around seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E

The first yellow flag came out on lap 4 due to the {{explosion}} of Robby Gordon's tire, leading Gordon to hit the wall. Gordon walked away uninjured. Kyle Busch led the field back to the green flag on the restart, but was passed by Kasey Kahne on lap 14. On lap 34, another caution was given as David Ragan's right front tire was deflating. On lap 40, Kahne led the field to the green flag; on the same lap, the third caution came out when Carl Edwards was clipped by Brad Keselowski and ran up the track <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> into Joey Logano. Also on the same lap, Kyle Busch passed Kahne to steal the lead. Busch then led the field until lap 48, when he was passed again by Kahne.|$|E
