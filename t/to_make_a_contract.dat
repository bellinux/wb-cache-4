5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> {{on his behalf}} with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, {{even though he was}} not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E
5|$|The Twins {{have made}} 16 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have made the first overall selection twice (1983 and 2001). They have also had 18 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Twins have six times failed to sign their first-round pick. Eddie Leon (1965), Dick Ruthven (1972), Jamie Allen (1976), and Tim Belcher (1983) all failed to sign with the Twins without the team receiving compensation. The Twins did, however, receive a compensatory pick when they failed to sign Jason Varitek (1993). Varitek did not sign and instead chose to enter the draft again the following year and was taken by the Seattle Mariners. Additionally, Travis Lee, the Twins' only selection in 1996 and the second-overall pick of that draft, did not sign with the team. Lee's agent, Scott Boras, did not communicate with the Twins for the first two weeks after the draft and then invoked a rarely used rule that a team was required <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> offer within 15 days of the draft or relinquish their rights to the player. As a result, Lee and 3 other 1996 first-round picks who were Boras clients were granted free agency and he ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

He {{set out in}} 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, {{he was able to}} convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed to Pocket Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to write books for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors.|$|E
25|$|An {{expression}} of intent inter presents becomes effective {{at the moment}} when the person to whom it is made understands it well. An {{expression of}} intent inter absents becomes effective {{at the moment when}} the notification of the expression reaches such other party, except when the withdrawal of the notification previously or simultaneously reaches such other party. The fact that after the notification of the expression the expresser dies, or becomes unable to make juridical acts, or is limited in capacity to make juridical acts, shall not null the expression of intent. In the interpretation of an expression of intent, the real intention of the parties must be sought rather than the literal meaning of the words. A person who offers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> shall be bound by his offer except at the time of offer he has excluded this obligation or except it may be presumed from the circumstances or from the nature of the affair that he did not intend to be bound. Exposing goods for sale with their selling price shall be deemed to be an offer. However, the sending of pricelists is not deemed to be an offer. An offer ceases to be binding if it is refused. An offer made inter presentes ceases to be binding if it is not accepted at once.An acceptance which arrives late, except under the circumstances in the preceding article, shall be deemed to be a new offer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper derives a novel {{approach}} to prove contraction of nonlinear dynamical systems, based {{on the use of}} non-Euclidean norms and their associated matrix measures. A graphical procedure is developed to derive conditions for a system to be contracting. Such conditions {{can also be used to}} design control strategies <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> system <b>contracting,</b> or <b>to</b> design consensus and synchronization strategies for networks of nonlinear oscillators. After presenting the main steps of the approach and its proof, both for continuous-time and discrete-time systems, we illustrate the theoretical derivations on a set of representative examples...|$|R

Schenken advocates an alternative treatment of this hand and recommends opener begin the auction with 1. Then, when responder replies with the anticipated 1 bid, opener can retreat to 2, which responder, with only 6 HCP, would pass. If responder's diamond holding were stronger, he could correct to 2. The partnership is more likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> 2 <b>contract</b> even against adverse defensive holdings.|$|R
