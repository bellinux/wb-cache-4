40|$|<b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> between {{negative}} and positive index medium waveguides is investigated theoretically in this paper. A coupled mode theory is developed for such a waveguide system and its validity is verified. Interesting phenomena in <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> waveguides are demonstrated, which occur in the case when the negative index medium waveguide in isolation guides its mode backward. A new type of coupled mode solution that varies exponentially with <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length {{is found in the}} special case when the propagation constants of two individual waveguides are nearly the same. A coupler operating in this case is insensitive to <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length, and its coupling efficiency can reach 100 % as long as <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length is long enough. However, when the propagation constants of the two individual waveguides differ greatly, <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mode solution is still a periodic function of <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length, but <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> power is output backward. In addition, the modes in the composite waveguide system are also studied using <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mode theory, and their fundamental properties are revealed. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

Then, a nonlinear mathematical model of <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> axial and torsional vibrations is established by the Galerkin method. Lastly, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed to investigate <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> effect of <b>the</b> beam vibration. A practical calculation example is calculated numerically and <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mechanism of <b>the</b> beam’s axial and torsional vibrations is analyzed in detail.

Since for the first time <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mechanism of <b>the</b> beam’s axial and torsional vibrations is theoretically analyzed, the findings in this work may provide directive reference for practical engineering problems in design of steam turbine generators. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the estimation of}} normalized coupling power among multi coupled fibers. Power transfer between the fibers has been determined based on coupled mode theory using Transfer Matrix Method. Theoretical calculation has shown that power in a fiber is no longer to be completely transferred to other M fibers (M> 3). This is caused by <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient between them. <b>The</b> <b>coupled</b> power or coupling ratio among M fibers can be controlled by maintaining <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> parameters. Experimentally, <b>the</b> change of <b>coupling</b> ratio is investigated, and theoretically by applying dc voltage to <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> region of fiber coupler. In three dimension, <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> power distribution shows that strongly depends on <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient and coupling length. However, by knowing <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> power parameters, <b>the</b> fiber coupler of MXN fibers are easier to be fabricated and more applicable in optical network system.
