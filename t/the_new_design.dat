5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|As the {{existing}} supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient to meet {{requirements for the}} production of the M3, the Ordnance Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design.</b> This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Just as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created {{a problem that}} was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

5|$|The He 111 design quickly {{ran through}} a series of minor design revisions. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111F models, which moved from the {{elliptical}} wing to one with straight leading and trailing edges, which could be manufactured more efficiently. The dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> had a wing span of 22.6m (74ft 1¾in) and an area of 87.60m² (942.90ft).|$|E
5|$|The He 111 was a {{twin-engine}} {{version of}} the Blitz, preserving the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was often called the Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E

5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium {{could not be}} used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E
5|$|Creating <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was the {{responsibility}} of Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{who had been in}} his position since 1925. Much of the work in preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, the defences {{were used}} to imprison Catholic recusants, who were often held in harsh conditions. The castle and blockhouses saw service during the sieges of the English Civil War in the 1640s, and {{remained}} in used during the interregnum. After the restoration of Charles II, the buildings were neglected until the King redeveloped the eastern defences of Hull in 1681, creating a larger fortification called the Citadel. The castle and the South Blockhouse formed part of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design,</b> although the North Blockhouse was allowed to fall into ruins and finally demolished in 1801. The former buildings remained in use, with various modifications, until the Citadel was demolished in 1864 to allow {{the construction of new}} docks.

5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building.

5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder of the tragedy of 1879.|$|E
50|$|Because {{younger workers}} have more {{years in which}} to accrue {{interest}} and pay credits than those approaching retirement age, critics of cash balance plans have called <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> discriminatory. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> may better {{meet the needs of}} a modern workforce and actually encourage older workers to remain at work, since benefit accruals continue at a constant pace as long as an employee remains on the job. As of 2008, the courts have generally rejected the notion that cash balance plans discriminate based on age, while the Pension Protection Act of 2006 offers relief for most hybrid plans on a prospective basis.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>design</b> {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
