5|$|The term titanates usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, as {{represented}} by barium <b>titanate</b> (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and {{is used as a}} transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium <b>titanate</b> 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
40|$|Sodium <b>titanates</b> are ion-exchange {{materials}} that effectively bind {{a variety of}} metal ions over a wide pH range. Sodium <b>titanates</b> alone have no known adverse biological effects but metal-exchanged <b>titanates</b> (or metal <b>titanates)</b> can deliver metal ions to mammalian cells to alter cell processes in vitro. In this work, we test a hypothesis that metal-titanate compounds inhibit bacterial growth; demonstration of this principle is one prerequisite to developing metal-based, titanate-delivered antibacterial agents. Focusing initially on oral diseases, we exposed five species of oral bacteria to <b>titanates</b> for 24 h, with or without loading of Au(III), Pd(II), Pt(II), and Pt(IV), and measuring bacterial growth in planktonic assays through increases in optical density. In each experiment, bacterial growth was compared with control cultures of <b>titanates</b> or bacteria alone. We observed no suppression of bacterial growth by the sodium <b>titanates</b> alone, but significant (p < 0. 05, two-sided t-tests) suppression was observed with metal-titanate compounds, particularly Au(III) -titanates, but with other metal <b>titanates</b> as well. Growth inhibition ranged from 15 to 100 % depending on the metal ion and bacterial species involved. Furthermore, in specific cases, the <b>titanates</b> inhibited bacterial growth 5 - to 375 -fold versus metal ions alone, suggesting that <b>titanates</b> enhanced metal-bacteria interactions. This work supports further development of metal <b>titanates</b> as a novel class of antibacterials...|$|R
40|$|MasterA Ni-YSZ {{catalyst}} with potassium <b>titanates</b> additives was researched {{to obtain}} an effective and stable catalyst for steam reforming of dodecane. Steam reforming of dodecane has two major problems, carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning. Between them, this study focuses on carbon deposition. Carbon deposition is deposition of carbon onto active sites of catalysts because of cracking of hydrocarbon. To overcome this phenomenon, potassium <b>titanates</b> added Ni-YSZ catalysts are effective. Steam reforming by potassium <b>titanates</b> Ni-YSZ maintained for 15 hour.

5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium <b>titanate</b> interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E

40|$|Rare-earth <b>titanates</b> RTiO$_ 3 $ are Mott {{insulators}} {{displaying a}} rich physical behavior, featuring most notably orbital and spin orders in their ground state. The origin of their ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition {{as a function}} of the size of the rare-earth however remains debated. Here we show on the basis of symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations that although rare-earth <b>titanates</b> are nominally Jahn-Teller active, the Jahn-Teller distortion is negligible and irrelevant for the description of the ground state properties. At the same time, we demonstrate that the combination of two antipolar motions produces an effective Jahn-Teller-like motion which is the key of the varying spin-orbital orders appearing in <b>titanates.</b> Thus, <b>titanates</b> are prototypical examples illustrating how a subtle interplay between several lattice distortions commonly appearing in perovskites can produce orbital orderings and insulating phases irrespective of proper Jahn-Teller motions.

40|$|Tausonites {{occurring}} in aegirine potassium feldspar syenite from the Little Murun potassic alkaline complex are characterised by complex growth and resorption features. These {{are attributed to}} non-equilibrium crystallisation i a dynamic environment characterised by magma mixing and/or volatile degassing. The crystals represent a transported assemblage which has no simple relationship to the magma from which their host rock crystallised. Tausonites exhibit significant normal, reverse and oscillatory compositional zoning with respect to strontium and the rare earth elements. The compositions are unique, ranging from tausonite to strontian cerian loparite, and are unlike those found in strontian perovskites from lamproites and fenites associated with carbonatites. Compositional data are presented for Ba-rich <b>titanates</b> belonging to the hollandite group, Ba(Ti,Fe) sOal and K 2 Ti 13027. The <b>titanates,</b> {{on the basis of}} textural evidence, are interpreted to have formed by the reaction of K-Ba-rich residual iquids with pre-existing Ti-magnetite, ilmenite and tausonite.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The determination of the effect of swelling and pillaring of hydrous crystalline <b>titanates,</b> labeled as the Types 3, 4 and 5, and hydrous crystalline silicon <b>titanates,</b> labeled as TAM- 7 and 8, on their physical and catalytic properties was the main objective of this research. The synthesis of these layered materials had been reported previously by Anthony and Dosch (1 990) and Anthony et al. (I 992). Prior to scaling the synthesis from 3 grams to 100 grams batches for characterization purposes, the effect of the synthesis conditions was also studied by varying the reaction temperature and time. These <b>titanates</b> were found to be very sensitive to the synthesis conditions. Catalysts were characterized by atomic adsorption, X-Ray diffraction, sorption measurements, thermal gravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis. By swelling and pillaring, the interlayer distance was increased up to 2. 6 nm prior to calcination at 500 'C. Although pillaring the <b>titanates,</b> by employing n-alkylanline and inorganic compounds, did improve the catalytic activity and the stability of the <b>titanates.</b> the structures changed substantially when calcined at 500 'C for 24 hours...|$|R
25|$|Strontium titanate's {{only major}} {{drawback}} (if one excludes excess fire) is fragility. It is both softer (hardness 5.5) and more brittle than synthetic rutile—for this reason, strontium <b>titanate</b> was also combined with more durable materials to create composites. It was otherwise the best simulant {{around at the}} time, and at its peak annual production was 1.5 million carats (300nbsp&kg). Due to patent coverage, all US production was by National Lead, while large amounts were produced overseas by Nakazumi Company of Japan. Commercial names for strontium <b>titanate</b> included Brilliante, Diagem, Diamontina, Fabulite, and Marvelite.|$|E
25|$|National Lead {{was also}} where {{research}} into the synthesis of another titanium compound—strontium <b>titanate</b> (SrTiO3, pure tausonite)—was conducted. Research was done during the late 1940s and early 1950s by Leon Merker and Langtry E. Lynd, who also used a tricone modification of the Verneuil process. Upon its commercial introduction in 1955, strontium <b>titanate</b> quickly replaced synthetic rutile as the most popular diamond simulant. This was due not only to strontium titanate's novelty, but to its superior optics: its RI (2.41) {{is very close to}} that of diamond, while its dispersion (0.19), although also very high, was a significant improvement over synthetic rutile's psychedelic display. Dopants were also used to give synthetic <b>titanate</b> a variety of colors, including yellow, orange to red, blue, and black. The material is also isotropic like diamond, meaning there is no distracting doubling of facets as seen in synthetic rutile.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the preparation of zinc and tungsten mesoporous <b>titanates</b> materials from a sol-gel method using a block copolymer as amphiphile. The mesoporous network is created through a soft templating method. Samples have been characterized by SAXS, XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, XPS, TEM, EDX, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopies. The presence of tungsten induces the formation of or crystal phase WO 3 besides the titania network and inhibits the formation of anatase, which is the predominant structure in the Zn-TiO 2 materials. No trace of ZnO is detected by XRD and Raman. However XPS suggests the presence of zinc ions in the mesoporous network and their linkage with oxygen atoms. The zinc oxide could therefore either be randomly dispersed or amorphous on the material surface. XPS and EDX also reveal that the tungsten clusters are located at {{the surface of the}} tungsten mesoporous <b>titanates.</b> Studies of the Kubelka-Munk function showed that at low Zn content, the band gap energy is in the range of the anatase one and the photocatalytic efficiency of the corresponding zinc <b>titanates</b> is similar to the one of the pure titania mesoporous material. Beyond the addition of 1 mol. % of tungsten, the <b>titanates</b> present a band gap energy in the range 2. 7 - 2. 8 eV, close to the value of the orthorhombic WO 3.
