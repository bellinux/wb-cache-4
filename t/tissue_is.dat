5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale cream. Spores are smooth, {{thin-walled}} and hyaline (translucent), roughly spherical to broadly egg-shaped, and measure 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5µm. They usually contain a single, large refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 6–10µm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, {{perpendicular to the}} cap surface) of narrow, club-shaped cells that are 2.5–4µm wide. Underneath this <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> the subhymenial layer of interwoven hyphae measuring 10–20µm in diameter. The spine <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> made of narrow (2–5µm diameter), thin-walled hyphae with clamp connections.|$|E

A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E

5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, {{the lighter}} alveolar <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury.

5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that medullary <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E

This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E
30|$|Freshly {{collected}} endometrial <b>tissue</b> <b>was</b> incubated ex vivo with NPs labelled with fluorescein (FITC) and TAT peptide for 10  mins.

50|$|Connective <b>tissues</b> <b>are</b> fibrous <b>tissues.</b> They <b>are</b> made up {{of cells}} {{separated}} by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix.

Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar <b>tissues</b> <b>are</b> examples of connective tissues.

5|$|The tiny sac fungus Phyllachora banksiae {{subspecies}} westraliensis {{has been}} described from the leaves of B.speciosa, its sole host.

5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E

The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E

5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary <b>tissue</b> <b>is</b> unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

40|$|The transeference of two antibiotics, i. e. {{cefmetazole}} (CMZ) and fosfomycin (FOM), into prostatic <b>tissues</b> <b>was</b> examined.

In TUR-P, resected prostatic <b>tissues</b> <b>were</b> washed with the TUR perfusate and the antibiotic in the <b>tissue</b> <b>was</b> presumed to be released into the perfusate. The following preliminary experiments were, therefore, carried out. The removed prostate was divided into three segments, i. e. urethral region, central region and capsular region, and the CMZ or FOM level in each <b>tissue</b> <b>was</b> measured. The remaining <b>tissues</b> <b>were</b> cut into small pieces for immersion in the TUR perfusate for 10 - 90 minutes. The <b>tissue</b> fragments <b>were</b> removed every 10 minutes to measure the tissue concentration of CMZ or FOM. The concentration of CMZ or FOM in the prostatic tissues did not vary among the three regions, however it markedly decreased with increase in the period of immersion.
