5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> like.|$|E

25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E
500|$|A short {{distance}} from the foundering ship, Baalham's boat encountered the partly filled port quarter boat. The loads were equalized, and the two vessels, with 45 persons in all, agreed to proceed under Baalham's overall command. After briefly considering—and rejecting—a suggestion that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> for other survivors, the two unprovisioned boats began rowing {{in the direction of}} the Newfoundland coast. Without an adequate compass, Baalham navigated by the run of the sea and occasional glimpses of the stars. [...] Many of these survivors were freezing through extensive immersion in the cold water, about nevertheless, they rowed through the night and the next day. Twice they sighted ships in the distance, but were not seen. Early on the morning of September 29 they were close to the shoreline of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, and shortly afterwards the two boats landed at Broad Cove, about [...] south of St John's.|$|E
500|$|The Smoking Mirror {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Gaming Age gave the game a B+, saying: [...] "The sound is another {{area in which}} The Smoking Mirror excels. Although there isn't a constant soundtrack playing, haunting music often accompanies certain actions, much like the original Tomb Raider." [...] PC Gamer gave it a score of 82%, saying it's [...] "more of the same solid adventure fare found in Circle of Blood." [...] GameSpot gave the game a 7.9 out of 10 and praised it for its additions that [...] "help to streamline the adventure", but criticised the [...] "insufficient information about Tezcatlipoca and Maya civilization altogether" [...] {{when it came to}} the storyline. Jen of Four Fat Chicks gave it a [...] "thumbs up" [...] and stated that he would recommend this game for the good storyline and the beautiful graphics, but if players want a game that has more adventuring, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> elsewhere. [...] "Mr. Bill and Lela" [...] of Mr. Bill's Adventureland praised its controls and humour, and called it an excellent sequel, that they wouldn't want to have missed out on playing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, The Guardian {{reported}} on a trend for frocks based around designs by the French Impressionists, adding: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> any more ridiculous than the Empress Eugénie hats that every other woman was wearing a few months ago". [...] In 1933, The Times reported that milliners were drawing on both the 18th century and the Second French Empire for inspiration, singling out Suzanne Talbot as showing styles similar to Empress Eugénie's riding hats and designs with trims turned up sharply on one side. A wide variety of materials were being used, including taffetas, straw and grosgrain. A year later, the Eugénie hat was still being adapted as part of new season's millinery designs, but now showing more of women's hairstyles: [...] "Hats are halo-like or sailor-like, but with considerable flatness.

[...] Videogamer.com gave it 5/10 saying [...] "The problem with Absolution is that its new custodians from the Kane and Lynch team seem to have fundamentally misunderstood what made Hitman great." [...] Blogcritics.org gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "There are definitely good things about it, but all too often the game's failures shine through more clearly than its successes." [...] PC Gamer gave it 66% saying [...] "A passable stealth game, but one that betrays almost everything that, until now, has made Hitman great." [...] GameTrailers gave it 6.9/10 saying [...] "It’s clear that {{a good deal of}} effort was put into crafting Hitman: Absolution’s world. This makes its flaws all the more unfortunate."

[...] GamerSyndrome gave no rating but said [...] "Hitman Absolution tries to be a jack of all trades but ends up being a master of none." [...] The Irish Times gave no score but said [...] "The move away from the completely open world may leave some hardcore fans of Hitman disappointed." [...] Gaming Age rated the game a 'C' and said [...] "It feels like I’m playing a low rent, knockoff Metal Gear title as opposed to traditional Hitman." [...] The Daily Record gave the game 3/5 saying [...] "While it’s more accessible than previous Hitman games, Absolution loses a lot of the freedom that fans of the franchise love, and perhaps doesn’t necessarily fit the Hitman name any longer." [...] TheEscapist gave no score but said [...] "Hitman Absolution is not the best nor the worst Hitman". Whatculture gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "Not Quite the expected hit". The Guardian gave it 3/5 saying [...] "The game may look better and play better than any Hitman game before it, but one can only marvel at how IO managed to lose sight of their IP's most appealing aspects so often." ...|$|E

After much consideration the church had been abandoned by all except Aunt Letty and Herbert. That Lady Fitzgerald should go there was impossible, and the girls were only too glad to be allowed to stay with their mother.

Two hundred pounds had been drawn from their little capital, and the balance was all that now remained.
