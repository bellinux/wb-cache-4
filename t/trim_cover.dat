40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of different materials on the formability of plastic injection molding {{has been studied}} in current work. The automotive glove box <b>trim</b> <b>cover</b> was chosen as analytical model. This study {{has been focused on}} the influence on fill time, warpage, sink mark depth and clamp force of different materials. PP+T 15, PP+T 20, PP+T 25, PP+T 30, PP+T 35, PP+T 40 and ABS+PC were used for analysis in this study. The injection molding processes of automotive interior trim of different materials were analyzed by using Moldflow software, the rationality of the material choice was evaluated. Merits and drawbacks of different materials were found out through the analysis done in Moldflow. There is positive influence on reducing mold cycle and negative influence on advancing the dimension stability of part by using the kind of PP materials. Oppositely, there is negative influence on reducing mold cycle and positive influence on advancing the dimension stability of part by using ABS. It can be reduce extremely the cost for manufacturing the mold, and shorten the development cycle by using this method...|$|E

50|$|Artificial turf is {{a surface}} of {{synthetic}} fibers {{made to look}} like natural grass. It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. However, it is now being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well. The main reason is maintenance—artificial turf stands up to heavy use, such as in sports, and requires no irrigation or <b>trimming.</b> Domed, <b>covered,</b> and partially covered stadiums may require artificial turf because of the difficulty of getting grass enough sunlight to stay healthy. But artificial turf does have its downside: limited life, periodic cleaning requirements, petroleum use, toxic chemicals from infill, and heightened health and safety concerns.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a 1-1/2 story structure, fashioned out of rough-cut ashlar Blue Hill granite with dressed granite <b>trim,</b> and <b>covered</b> with a gabled slate roof.

50|$|The John T. Cyphers House is a small, one-story cottage {{with a lower}} wing {{projecting}} from the rear. The main entrance is centered on the long west façade, flanked symmetrically {{by a pair of}} windows on either side. Directly above the windows are two dormers {{projecting from}} the roof, mirrored by another two dormers facing the rear. The house is largely plain, but there are Gothic Revival decorations in an arch above the door, arched windows on the gable ends, and rusticated wooden trim. Much of this <b>trim</b> is <b>covered</b> up by modern roofing material, and the carved bargeboards are gone. A 20th-century owner recoated the outer walls to prevent spalling of the original grout.|$|R

The doors are also fabric-trimmed, with elastic-topped map pouches on both sides. Vents are installed in the dash to direct heated air to the windshield and to passenger seating positions. Despite these advanced features, contemporary reports suggest that the buyer's assembly time for the Bernardi was expected to be a relatively low 100 to 120 hours.|$|R

40|$|Background: Barrier {{membrane}} {{helps in}} periodontal regeneration by preventing {{the migration of}} epithelial cells and cells from the gingival connective tissue onto the root surface. Different types of membranes {{have been used to}} regenerate periodontal tissues. There are very few documented reports where rubber dam {{has been used as a}} barrier membrane for regeneration of periodontal defects. Case Description: A female patient aged 20 years with localized aggressive periodontal disease participated in this clinical report. Infrabony defect in the lower anterior region was selected for surgical treatment. Rubber dam was <b>trimmed</b> to <b>cover</b> the defect. Orthodontic treatment was done for the realignment of malpositioned teeth 1 year after the surgery and patient was followed up for a period of 3 years after surgery. Results: Rubber barrier membrane did not result in any untoward side effects. Patient did not show any sign of inflammation or recurrence of probing depth at 3 -year follow-up period. Clinical Implications: Rubber dam as barrier membrane yields good results...|$|R

The first Pandas also featured removable, washable seat <b>covers,</b> door <b>trims</b> and dashboard <b>cover,</b> and all the glass panels were flat making them cheap to produce, easy to replace and interchangeable between left and right door.

50|$|The {{development}} of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, {{which was in the}} headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the seats on the back panel below the rear parcel shelf, was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black <b>trims</b> that <b>covered</b> only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, covering the whole wheel. However, {{only a small number of}} 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977-78.|$|R
