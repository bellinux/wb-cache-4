25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

In his opening speech Gairdner stated that [...] "The public must {{learn that the}} {{handicapped}} person is not an invalid. I am handicapped, but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> loathe is for people to treat me as an invalid. We, the public, must realise {{what can be done}} to rehabilitate people who have suffered a grevious physical disadvantage".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go back {{and have a look}} at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm going to get the National banned." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{looked at}} it from every angle, but insurmountable {{difficulties}} seemed to be blocking <b>the</b> way. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{could not afford to}} do: I could not afford to be a coward".|$|R

500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality. It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be close, to me is quite an honour as a developer. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did was, when I looked at their game I was like, damn them! What have they done to the rest of us? I was looking for something where I could say, okay, that we're doing better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Colonel Keith, don't!" [...] cried Rachel; [...] "it is just <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> where <b>I</b> {{could not}} bear to believe Alick. She was so dear and beautiful, and spoke so rightly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somehow," [...] she said, softly, [...] "I always {{prayed that}} you might remember. You were <b>the</b> <b>one</b> true <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had ever met, you were in earnest. It is past, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> {{have sworn}} not to do." [...] For {{he had told}} the priest of the {{promises}} he had made both to his uncle and to his uncle's widow.|$|R
2500|$|Almost {{every major}} college program {{recruited}} Marinovich who, {{as a high}} school freshman, began getting letters from Stanford. Despite the family connections to USC he was uncertain whether he fit the program's offense. After a positive visit, however, Marinovich chose the university over recent national champions BYU and Miami, as well as Arizona State, Stanford, and Washington. Marinovich took his college selection seriously, noting: [...] "This is the biggest decision of my life. It means not only where I will play football, but most likely, who I will marry, who my best friends for life will be, and where I will live. It means everything. And <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know for sure is I'm too young to make this kind of decision by myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E

6000|$|... "You take a {{pleasure}} to torment me," [...] said I, [...] "and I make a very feckless plaything; {{but let me ask}} you to be more merciful. At this time there is but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. P. We {{can detect}} {{all sorts of}} things. The {{inferior}} animals have instincts, you know. (I must say my wife is always very satirical upon this point of the relative rank of <b>the</b> sexes.) <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> am sure of is, {{that she is not}} happy; and oh, Pen! that she does not care much for her little girl.|$|R
2500|$|In 1941, she {{approached}} Harry James, offering {{to work for}} him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, [...] "Harry James was wonderful. When I joined him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want is to start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put me up for a chorus {{in the middle of an}} instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it." [...] She also told writer George T. Simon, [...] "I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again." [...] In his book, The Big Bands, Simon explained that Harry James constructed [...] "the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star." [...] It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including [...] "I Had the Craziest Dream" [...] in 1942, and 1941's [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You." [...] In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film Springtime in the Rockies, starring Betty Grable.|$|E

6000|$|... "Cousin," [...] he replied, [...] "you seek of me <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>I</b> {{must not}} give.

6000|$|Stannard frowned. [...] "You {{are going}} to <b>the</b> hotel. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> doubt if you could reach Jimmy; you're badly jarred and your nerve's gone. Then, unless you get help, we can't carry Jimmy out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{suffering}} neither from <b>one</b> or <b>the</b> other. But {{there is}} a most valuable ring lying out in the garden. Will you send for it?"

6000|$|... "No," [...] Deacon {{declared}} positively. [...] "I counted every card I took in. That's <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{was correct}} on. I've twenty-six, and you've twenty-six." ...|$|E

"That was <b>the</b> number <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> got {{hit with}} in the first fight, so I did work a lot against guys with good kicks and was working on {{checking}} them a lot.
