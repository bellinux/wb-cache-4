He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.|$|E
40|$|Most {{distributed}} {{object-oriented programming}} languages typically support a medium-grain parallel programming style for a virtual machine {{composed of a}} network of workstations. While the application of conventional compiler optimizations make <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computation efficient, it is the support for interactions between <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computation across <b>the</b> processors that promises significant impact over the performance of distributed programs. Interactions between <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computations are best supported by explicit programming abstractions. We present a distributed object-oriented programming language called Pragati, and its support for interaction paradigms in multi-threaded computations via a number of examples. We observe that the programming abstractions of Pragati help capture a wide range of interaction behaviour between <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> distributed application...|$|R

The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the Otherworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river.

25|$|In Rome, {{the sack}} of 1527 by the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his largely Protestant {{mercenary}} troops was enormously destructive both {{of art and}} artists, many of whose biographical records end abruptly. Other artists managed to escape to different parts of Italy, often finding difficulty in picking up <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> their careers.

In Germany, however, the leading figures such as Albrecht Dürer and his pupils, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer and the Danube school, and Hans Holbein the Younger all followed the Reformers. The development of German religious painting had come to an abrupt halt by about 1540, although many prints and book illustrations, especially of Old Testament subjects, continued to be produced.|$|E
25|$|It {{is highly}} {{probable}} that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in three fate goddesses who spun the destinies of mankind. Although such fate goddesses {{are not directly}} attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the Atharvaveda does contain an allusion comparing fate to a warp. Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology. Examples include the Hittite Gulses, the Greek Moirai, the Roman Parcae, the Norse Norns, the Lithuanian Deivės Valdytojos, the Latvian Láimas, the Serbian Sudjenice, and the Albanian Fatit. They appear in English mythology as the Wyrdes, who were later adapted to become the Three Witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth. An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.|$|E

During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> Tekhelet is a blue-violet or blue thread, which, {{according}} to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a mollusc (notably the Hexaplex trunculus sea snail). Due {{to a number of}} factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping unkosher) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the Rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was indigo or Isatis tinctoria.|$|E

His garments unclean become unclean from the moment that he has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the moment that he pushed it over the precipice.|$|E

25|$|The Romanian popular costume {{finds its}} roots in the part of Thracian, Dacian and Getae {{ancestors}} and resembles with that of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, of course with differences consisting of decorative and colorful details. Between 7000 and 3500 BC was founded the belief in the one controlling power of the cosmos. Fabrics wore symbols appointed by virtue of faith, thus spinning and weaving became sacred. Therefore, were customary on the dresses the solar circle, the column of the sky, the rhomb, the hatch or the curved lines. Since 3500 BC and until year zero has passed from the sacred weaving to the vestment, the ritual reaching from the imposing space of the temple to the household hearth. The purpose of the garments worn by the ancestors was to facilitate dialogue with the unseen forces of the cosmos. Thus, it is still possible to talk about a civilization of sacred fabrics. For example, <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> spun is column-shaped and spirally twisted, which increases the sacredness of the fabric. Also, having different colors is the most useful means for expressing feelings and behaviors. Popular clothes Carpatho-Danubian territory summarizes existential and spiritual dimension of Romanians, but component parts of clothes multiplied and the clothing became a costume. As a result, the autochthonous popular garment is a system of which developed the regional variations, through innovations and contaminations caused by each creator against the prototype schema.|$|E
