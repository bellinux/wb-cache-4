25|$|One of {{the newest}} {{organizational}} structures developed in the 20th century is team and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical. While an organization is constituted {{as a set of}} people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around <b>the</b> <b>competencies</b> of teams in totality. For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous profit centre composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team. Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Diocletian (284) {{undertook}} {{the restoration}} of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the so-called dominate which tried to give the impression of absolute power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: [...] whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation he imposed price controls [...] which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 [...] "Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half (with residence in Nicomedia). In 296 he elevated Maximian as Augustus of the western half where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum (Current day Milan) when not on the move. In 292 he created two 'junior' emeperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul and Spain whose see was in Trier and Licinius in Srimium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305 Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed to colleagues for themselves. After the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power during the years 306-313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine called the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy not by changing the structure but by rationalizing <b>the</b> <b>competencies</b> of the several ministries during the years 325-330 after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East at the end of 324.The so-called Edict of Milan of 313, actually a fragment of a Letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone including to Christians and ordered {{the restoration of}} confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; Constantinople. The creation of Constantinople would {{have a profound effect on}} Europe: it was the bulwark against invasion and conquest from the East for 1000 years.|$|E

This study adopted <b>the</b> <b>competency</b> model from American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) in 1999 (Rothwell, Sanders, and Soper, 1999), and <b>the</b> <b>competency</b> model includes business, analytical, leadership, technical, interpersonal and technological competency groups. This study distributed 582 questionnaires in two months with a return rate of 38. 66 %. The results showed that HR practitioners possess <b>the</b> highest <b>competency</b> level on interpersonal, analytical and leadership competency groups as well as the perceived importance on interpersonal, leadership and analytical competency groups. Furthermore, there are some gaps in <b>the</b> <b>competency</b> groups, and <b>the</b> <b>competency</b> groups of leadership, analytical and business have the largest gap among these six groups. Based on the background of human resource practitioners, this study further classified research sample and made comparation and analysis.

In addition, the model also distinguished difference between high satisfaction employee and poor satisfaction employee. The results have implications on recruitment, selection and training.
