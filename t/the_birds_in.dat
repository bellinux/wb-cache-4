5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. Foie gras is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E

5|$|The Salem {{district}} administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not {{to invest in}} the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 to one or two thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold.|$|E
5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially damaging to <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b> <b>In</b> the {{great spotted woodpecker}} {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built for Sir Edmund Wright, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640. The brick {{structure}} dates from between 1629 and 1638. In 1629, Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley, who had undertaken extensive remedial work on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds—probably timber-framed and wattle filled. Bingley's alterations {{were said to have}} been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds. He was accused of driving away almost all <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> the dovehouse, and of pulling up many healthy fruit-bearing trees from the orchard. The house had a moat, which Bingley filled in, believing the water to be unhealthy, at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E

All of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> this genus are small and agile. Scops owls are colored in various {{brownish}} hues, sometimes with a lighter underside and/or face, which helps to camouflage them against the bark of trees.

25|$|John James Audubon (born Jean Rabin; April 26, 1785– January 27, 1851) was an American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter.

While many wetland birds are flushed by birds of prey, these storks are not usually intimidated and can be quite aggressive to other large water-birds such as herons and cranes. Adults aggressively defend small depressions of deep water against egrets and herons (at Malabanjbanjdju in Kakadu National Park, Australia), and drying wetland patches against waterbirds such as spoonbills and woolly-necked storks (at Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, India).|$|E

Sakura gives Syaoran a ring which she had received from Tomoyo; Syaoran confronts Dodo, realizing that the ring is composed of all the citizens' birds. Tomoyo's bird Lei-Fan helps Syaoran fight Dodo, who is carrying the king. Tomoyo tells Syaoran to use the ring to fight the king and Syaoran, surrounded by fire, launches himself to destroy Dodo. He knocks out the king, whose body transforms into a bird and leaves one of Sakura's feathers behind. Because of the ring the country remains trapped in darkness, and Syaoran's group asks Dimensional Witch Yūko Ichihara for help. Tomoyo gives Yūko her bell, sacrificing {{the relationship between the}} citizens and <b>the</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>in</b> exchange for a key which frees the country from its darkness.|$|E
