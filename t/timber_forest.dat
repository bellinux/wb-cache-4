6000|$|I {{will now}} leave {{pronunciation}} {{and turn to}} words or phrases which have been supposed peculiar to us, only pausing {{to pick up a}} single dropped stitch, in the pronunciation of the word súpreme, which I had thought native till I found it in the well-languaged Daniel. I will begin with a word of which I have never met with any example in any English writer of authority. We express the first stage of withering in a green plant suddenly cut down by the verb to wilt. It is, of course, own cousin of the German welken, but I have never come upon it in literary use, and my own books of reference give me faint help. Graff gives welhèn, marcescere, and refers to weih (weak), and conjecturally to A.-S, hvelan. The A.-S. wealwian (to wither) is nearer, but not so near as two words in the Icelandic, which perhaps put us on the track of its ancestry,--velgi, tepefacere, (and velki, with the derivative) meaning contaminare. Wilt, at any rate, is a good word, filling, as it does, a sensible gap between drooping and withering, and the imaginative phrase 'he wilted right down,' like 'he caved right in,' is a true Americanism. Wilt occurs in English provincial glossaries, but is explained by wither, which with us it does not mean. We have a few words such as cache, cohog, carry (portage), shoot (chute), <b>timber</b> (<b>forest),</b> bushwhack (to pull a boat along by the bushes {{on the edge of a}} stream), buckeye (a picturesque word for the horse-chestnut); but how many can we be said to have fairly brought into the language, as Alexander Gill, who first mentions Americanisms, meant it when he said, 'Sed et ab Americanis nonnulla mutuamur ut MAIZ et CANOA'? Very few, I suspect, and those mostly by borrowing from the French, German, Spanish, or Indian.[28] 'The Dipper,' for the 'Great Bear,' strikes me as having a native air. Bogus, in the sense of worthless, is undoubtedly ours, but is, I more than suspect, a corruption of the French bagasse (from low Latin bagasea), which travelled up the Mississippi from New Orleans, where it was used for the refuse of the sugar-cane. It is true, we have modified the meaning of some words. We use freshet in the sense of flood, for which I have not chanced upon any authority. Our New England cross between Ancient Pistol and Dugald Dalgetty, Captain Underhill, uses the word (1638) to mean a current, and I do not recollect it elsewhere in that sense. I therefore leave it with a? for future explorers. Crick for creek I find in Captain John Smith and in the dedication of Fuller's 'Holy Warre,' and run, meaning a small stream, in Waymouth's 'Voyage' (1605). Humans for men, which Mr. Bartlett includes in his 'Dictionary of Americanisms,' is Chapman's habitual phrase in his translation of Homer. I find it also in the old play of 'The Hog hath lost his Pearl.' Dogs for andirons is still current in New England, and in Walter de Biblesworth I find chiens glossed in the margin by andirons. Gunning for shooting is in Drayton. We once got credit for the poetical word fall for autumn, but Mr. Bartlett and the last edition of Webster's Dictionary refer us to Dryden. It is even older, for I find it in Drayton, and Bishop Hall has autumn fall. Middleton plays upon the word: 'May'st thou have a reasonable good spring, for thou art like to have many dangerous foul falls.' Daniel does the same, and Coleridge uses it as we do. Gray uses the archaism picked for peaked, and the word smudge (as our backwoodsmen do) for a smothered fire. Lord Herbert of Cherbury (more properly perhaps than even Sidney, the last preux chevalier) has 'the Emperor's folks' just as a Yankee would say it. Loan for lend, with which we have hitherto been blackened, I must retort upon the mother island, for it appears so long ago as in 'Albion's England.' Fleshy, in the sense of stout, may claim Ben Jonson's warrant, and I find it also so lately as in Francklin's 'Lucian.' Chore is also Jonson's word, and I am inclined to prefer it to chare and char, because I think that I see a more natural origin for it in the French jour--whence it might come to mean a day's work, and thence a job--than anywhere else.[29] At onst for at once I thought a corruption of our own, till I found it in the Chester Plays. I am now inclined to suspect it no corruption at all, but only an erratic and obsolete superlative at onest. To progress was flung in our teeth till Mr. Pickering retorted with Shakespeare's 'doth prógress down thy cheeks.' I confess that I was never satisfied with this answer, because the accent was different, and because the word might here be reckoned a substantive quite as well as a verb. Mr. Bartlett (in his dictionary above cited) adds a surrebutter in a verse from Ford's 'Broken Heart.' Here the word is clearly a verb, but with the accent unhappily still on the first syllable. Mr. Bartlett says that he 'cannot say whether the word was used in Bacon's time or not.' It certainly was, and with the accent we give to it. Ben Jonson, in the 'Alchemist,' had this verse, ...|$|E

30|$|Francaviglia (2000) {{suggested}} that prairie fires burned {{along the edges}} of Cross Timbers and may have extinguished in their interior {{due to a lack of}} fuels. In contrast, Engle et al. (1996) emphasized that fire is needed to promote and restore native plant and animal species and reduce woody encroachment. Fire scar history studies have shown that fires were common to Cross <b>Timbers</b> <b>forests,</b> both historically and recently. Clark et al. (2007) reported a median fire return interval of 2.0 years (period: 1772 to 2002) for an old-growth Cross <b>Timbers</b> <b>forest</b> north of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here, fires burned more frequently since settlement than before. In a 20 ha area within the Chautauqua Hills of southern Kansas, fire scars also indicated historically frequent fire (median fire interval = 2.1 years, period: 1850 to 2005; M.C. Stambaugh, University of Missouri-Columbia, unpublished data). At the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in central Oklahoma, fire scars indicated near-annual burning during the late twentieth century (median fire interval = 1.4 years, period: 1947 to 1992; Shirakura 2006). More information is needed that describes the historic importance of fire to the Cross Timbers and how it relates to the grassdominated areas of the southern Great Plains. Descriptions of the historic fire regime would aid in designing fire treatments to mimic historic conditions and measuring the effectiveness of prescribed burning treatments used to restore vegetation composition and structure.|$|R
