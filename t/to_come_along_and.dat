5|$|Deke finally catches up. He {{allows the}} {{remaining}} {{members of the}} posse to take the bullet-riddled bodies of the gang members back and collect the reward, while electing to stay behind, knowing what awaits the posse. After a period, Sykes arrives with a band of the previously seen Mexican rebels, who have killed off what's left of the posse along the way. Sykes asks Deke <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> join the revolution. Deke smiles and rides off with them.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond the limits of the probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
25|$|This {{plan was}} ready to be set in action in early March 1864, after {{somewhat}} belated communication initiated by Banks to inform Sherman and Porter of their roles in Halleck's strategy. Banks sent Sherman, Halleck, and Porter a report prepared by Major David Houston clearly showing the near impossibility of maintaining an occupation in Shreveport and east Texas without major resources. Most of Banks' men, accompanied by a large, poorly trained, cavalry force would march north toward the middle river. Banks would allow cotton speculators <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> Porter was bringing barges to collect cotton as lucrative naval prizes.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: [...] "Perfect! [...] And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> lay a golf course upon it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is for someone <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And {{when it comes to}} Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, Go Man Go {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: [...] "Go Man Go, The King." ...|$|E

He prefers books and pornography instead.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to farming, Weatherford's {{father was a}} small-time local politician, winning election as county clerk of Putnam County and serving in that capacity {{until his death in}} 1856. His mother died in 1862, leaving Weatherford an orphan at a young age. In 1864 Weatherford traveled to Oregon along with the family of a friend of his late father's. In his own later telling of the tale, Weatherford said that he had been passing time in a local mercantile when his father's friend William Morgan had casually remarked, [...] "Jimmy, I’m leaving for Oregon tomorrow — you ought <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> drive a team for me," [...] with the young Weatherford rather spontaneously taking him up on the offer.|$|E

Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which actually is a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. However, Puss is unable to defeat Shrek and, revealing that he was paid by Harold, requests <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> make amends.

2500|$|Another type {{of verbal}} lore common within family groups is the unique family {{expression}} or saying. A saying {{can be created}} at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying [...] "… good worker, very strong" [...] signifies that the speaker wants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in. Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.|$|E
2500|$|The band Jones & Giftet (Jones & the Poison) {{was formed}} with members Joakim [...] "Jocke" [...] Berg, Martin Sköld, Markus Mustonen, Sami Sirviö and Thomas Bergqvist (synthesizers). It {{all started with}} Berg going to London and buying two guitars, one for Sirviö and one for himself. Sirviö and Berg had a band that rehearsed at Bålsta Musikslott which {{consisted}} of three people. Inspired by My Bloody Valentine, Sköld and Berg decided {{they were going to}} start a new band. This happened at the school S:t Eskils cafeteria Grönan. Berg and Sköld met up with a very drunk Mustonen outside of the Restaurant Vildsvinet in Eskilstuna. Whilst drunk, he promised to join the band and play the drums. Thomas Bergqvist, a friend of Martin Sköld, was invited <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> play the synth. The first gig was played in [...] Lindesberg in Västmanland, and the second at Knegoffs in Eskilstuna.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "True Crime {{is the first}} game <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> truly give the Grand Theft Auto series a run for its money." [...] However, he also wrote [...] "a number of roadblocks hold True Crime back from {{achieving}} greatness [...] The game has amazing variety. Unfortunately, none of these individual components feel particularly polished." [...] Of the protagonist, he wrote [...] "Nick Kang is quite easily the most annoying new character in video games." [...] He concluded [...] "It's not nearly as good as GTA, but entertaining nonetheless." [...] Justin Leeper scored the GameCube version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "this is {{the worst of the}} three console versions of this title. Fortunately, it's still pretty darn good."

[...] Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote [...] "True Crime is the first game <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> truly give the Grand Theft Auto series a run for its money."

[...] GameSpot's Jeff Gertsmann called Kang [...] "completely unlikeable" [...] and [...] "an unnecessarily cocky jerk." [...] Of the gameplay, he wrote [...] "it makes decent attempts with its different styles of gameplay, {{but none of them}} are particularly well done." [...] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell was critical of the graphics, citing [...] "low-resolution textures, some clipping issues, a rather horrible depth of field effect and a lack of screen-filling vistas." [...] He also called Kang [...] "one of the most unlikeable folks I've ever had the displeasure of thumbing around a third-person action game". However, he concluded [...] "it's a respectable enough game in its own right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen {{was finding}} {{unexpected}} relationships from the fossils: the batch included the horse sized Scelidotherium {{which appeared to}} be closely allied to the anteater, a gigantic ground sloth, and an ox-sized armoured armadillo which he called Glyptodon. The Patagonian spine and leg bones from Port St Julian which Darwin had thought might be from a Mastodon were apparently from a gigantic guanaco or Llama, or perhaps camel, which Owen named Macrauchenia. Lyell saw a [...] "law of succession" [...] with mammals being replaced by their own kind on each continent, and on 17 February used his presidential address at the Geological Society to present Owen's findings to date on Darwin's fossils, pointing out this inference that extinct species were related to current species in the same locality. He invited Darwin <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> the speech drew Darwin's attention {{to the question of}} why past and present species in one place should be so closely related. At the same meeting Darwin was elected to the Council of the Society. For Lyell this was [...] "a glorious addition to my society of geologists", gentlemen (and amateurs of independent means) with duty only to scientific integrity, social stability and responsible religion, for Darwin it meant joining the respectable élite of eminent geologists developing a science dealing with the age of the earth and the Days of Creation.|$|E

2500|$|Hegel {{made the}} {{distinction}} between civil society and state in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term [...] "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" [...] though it is now referred to as Zivilgesellschaft in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the dialectical relationship that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community {{of the state and}} the micro-community of the family. Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the political left and right. On the left, it became the foundation for Karl Marx's civil society as an economic base; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between political society and civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville. In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of [...] "lesser" [...] and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> destroy that which was not fully realized.|$|E

50|$|Nuvo {{hangs out}} {{with a group of}} pals who have an inordinate {{interest}} in getting high, and like his buddies he's always interested in the next new chemical <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>along.</b> Nuvo <b>and</b> his friends Swatch, Chad, Theo and Ping. have heard about a new drug called the Helix, but while they'd like to give it a try, word on the street is that it has rather unpredictable effects—used properly, it can give its users deep enlightenment, but a bad trip can literally cause you to lose your mind. Nuvo's interest in the Helix is more philosophical than recreational, and he falls in with two mysterious figures, Infiniti and Orpheum, who are searching for The Other One—a person who can break through to a new level of understanding while tripping on the Helix.|$|R

6000|$|Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard's tigerish {{affection for}} the younger man, his {{constant}} liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence.
