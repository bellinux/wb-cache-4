25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, their perception becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and {{it could have been a}} very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet, you may be both surprised and glad it wasn't.

2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer.

I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E

60|$|The modern world, in fact, {{had fallen}} between two stools.
