40|$|Achieving {{the desired}} {{resonant}} frequency of resonators {{has been an}} important issue, since it determines their performance. This paper presents the design and analysis of two concepts for the resonant frequency tuning of resonators. The proposed methods are based on the stiffness alteration of the springs by geometrical modification (shaft-widening) or by mechanical restriction (shaft-holding) using micromachined frequency <b>tuning</b> <b>units.</b> Our designs have advantages in (1) reversible and repetitive tuning; (2) decoupled control over the amplitude of the resonator and the tuning ratio; and (3) a wide range of applications including torsional resonators. The ability to tune the frequency by both methods is predicted by finite element analysis (FEA) and experimentally verified on a torsional resonator driven by an electrostatic actuator. The <b>tuning</b> <b>units</b> and resonators are fabricated on a double silicon-on-insulator (DSOI) wafer to electrically insulate the resonator from the <b>tuning</b> <b>units.</b> The shaft-widening type and shaft-holding type exhibit a maximum tuning ratio of 5. 29 % and 10. 7 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|I have {{examined}} {{the performance of a}} population coding model of visual orientation discrimination, similar to the population coding models proposed for the coding of limb movements. The orientation of the stimulus is not represented by a single unit but by an ensemble of broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>units</b> in a distributed way. Each unit is represented by a vector whose magnitude and direction correspond to the response magnitude and preferred orientation of the unit, respectively. The orientation of the population vector, i. e. the vector sum of the ensemble of units, is the signalled orientation on a particular trial. The accuracy of this population vector orientation coding was determined as a function of a number of parameters by computer simulation. I have shown that even with broadly orientation <b>tuned</b> <b>units</b> possessing considerable response variance, the accuracy of the orientation of the population vector can be as good as behaviorally measured just noticeable differences in orientation. The accuracy of the population code is shown to depend upon the number of units, the average response strength, the orientation band-width, response variability and the response covariance. The results of these simulations were also compared to predictions derived from psychophysical studies of orientation discrimination. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|A TURF (<b>Tuning</b> <b>Unit</b> Radio Frequency) is an Antenna <b>Tuning</b> <b>Unit</b> or ATU. It {{is used to}} artificially {{lengthen}} {{the antenna}} (or tune it) Often at HF wavelengths for example an antenna would be physically too long to attach to a radio without affecting portability and manoeuvrability. A shorter vehicle whip was more practicable and also field antennas were constructed with for example, vertical radiators constructed using the Racal 8 or 12 metre masts. Because these were an electrical compromise, {{they had to be}} tuned by use of a TURF (or electrically matched to the set). The TURF 25 Watt (a separate unit to the radio) is considered mandatory when using the VRC321 it tunes both unbalanced, end fed wires and whips and also balanced antenna such as the dipole.|$|E
50|$|An antenna tuner, a matchbox, transmatch, antenna <b>tuning</b> <b>unit</b> (ATU), or {{antenna coupler}} is a device {{connected}} between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching {{the impedance of}} the radio to the antenna's feedline. Similar matching networks are used in other equipment (such as linear amplifiers) to transform impedance.|$|E
50|$|A TUAAM (<b>Tuning</b> <b>Unit</b> Automatic Antenna Matching) is an ATU which {{matches the}} antenna at VHF {{and which is}} used mainly with the VRC 353 and PRC 351/2 (when used with the clip-in kit and mounted in a vehicle). The TUAAM {{automatically}} tunes the antenna, and artificially shortens it rather than lengthening it, but essentially it performs the same function as a TURF.|$|E
40|$|The Problem: To {{understand}} how faces are processed in cortex, {{and whether the}} face processing mechanism is special. Motivation: The Face Inversion Effect (FIE) has been widely documented as an effect of the uniqueness of face processing [1, 2, 3]. Experience with faces has been postulated to {{play a crucial role}} in the FIE, causing subjects to process faces differently from other object classes [2]. However, simulations in our model of object recognition suggest that no special processing has to be assumed to observe an inversion effect [4]. Thus, an inversion effect should also be obtainable with other object classes on which subjects have been trained to become experts. Previous Work: In exploring the FIE, Carey and Diamond [2] obtained an inversion effect with dogs as stimuli and dog show judges (experts) as subjects. In simulations using HMAX (see figure 1), a hierarchical, shape based model [11], we have shown that the magnitude of the inversion effect is a function of the specificity of the representation[4]. Using many, sharply <b>tuned</b> <b>units,</b> an “expert ” shows a large inversion effect. On the other hand, a “novice ” with fewer, more broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>units</b> only shows a small or no inversion effect. view-tuned unit...|$|R

40|$|The face {{inversion}} {{effect has}} been widely documented as an effect of the uniqueness of face processing. Using a computational model, we show that the face inversion effect is a byproduct of expertise {{with respect to the}} face object class. In simulations using HMAX, a hierarchical, shape based model, we show that the magnitude of the inversion effect {{is a function of the}} specificity of the representation. Using many, sharply <b>tuned</b> <b>units,</b> an ``expert'' has a large inversion effect. On the other hand, if fewer, broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>units</b> are used, the expertise is lost, and this ``novice'' has a small inversion effect. As the size of the inversion effect is a product of the representation, not the object class, given the right training we can create experts and novices in any object class. Using the same representations as with faces, we create experts and novices for cars. We also measure the feasibility of a view-based model for recognition of rotated objects using HMAX. Using faces, we show that transfer of learning to novel views is possible. Given only one training view, the view-based model can recognize a face at a new orientation via interpolation from the views to which it had been tuned. Although the model can generalize well to upright faces, inverted faces yield poor performance because the features change differently under rotation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConvolutional {{models of}} object {{recognition}} achieve invariance to spatial transformations {{largely because of}} the use of a suitably defined pooling operator. This operator typically {{takes the form of a}} max or average function defined across <b>units</b> <b>tuned</b> to the same feature. As a model of the brain's ventral pathway, where computations are carried out by weighted synaptic connections, such pooling can lead to spatial invariance only if the weights that connect similarly <b>tuned</b> <b>units</b> to a given pooling unit are of approximately equal strengths. How identical weights can be learned in the face of nonuniformly distributed data remains unclear. In this letter, we show how various versions of the trace learning rule can help solve this problem. This allows us in turn to explain previously published results and make recommendations as to the optimal rule for invariance learning...|$|R
