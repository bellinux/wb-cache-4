40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} the problem of driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol; which {{is due to the fact}} that alcohol is present in every third traffic accident. We studied <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol on a person and his or her driving capabilities, how often people drive under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol, and how often it comes up as a {{secondary}} reason for traffic accidents. We also investigated how drivers under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol are treated, and how occurrences of such driving could be prevented. At the end, we described some projects and organizations that deal with the prevention of this problem. In the empiric part, we used a quantitative approach to check the most common reasons for driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol. We were also interested in the differences between men and women, and younger and older drivers regarding their opinions on driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol. We were also looking for a connection between experiences of driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol and opinions regarding rising or lowering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. The results show that women rarely drive under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol, and are more strongly against driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> than men. We managed to prove a connection between experiences of driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol and opinions regarding the altering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. There were no significant differences in our sample between younger and older drivers regarding opinions on driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{simulated}} dog {{population dynamics}} for a thirty-years period using a logistic growth model. Through sensitivity analyses, we determined <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of <b>the</b> parameters {{used in the}} model. Carrying capacity was the most influential parameter in all simulations. In the owned-dog population, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of immigration, abandonment and births was 19 %, 16 % and 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of <b>the</b> carrying capacity, respectively. In the sterilized owned-dog population, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of abandonment, female and male sterilization was 37 %, 30 % and 27 % of <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of <b>the</b> carrying capacity. In the stray population, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of abandonment, carrying capacity of the owned-dog population and adoption was 10 %, 9 % and 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of <b>the</b> carrying capacity. In the sterilized stray population, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of births, female sterilization and male sterilization was 45 %, 15 % and 13 % of <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of <b>the</b> carrying capacity. Other parameters had lower influence values. Modification of the carrying capacity requires different interventions for the owned- and stray-dog populations.

5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
