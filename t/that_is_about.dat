5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E

5|$|Pseudoryzomys simplex, {{also known}} as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae from south-central South America. It is found in lowland palm savanna and thorn scrub habitats. It is a {{medium-sized}} species, weighing about , with gray–brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> as long as the head and body. The IUCN has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern, although almost nothing is known of its diet or reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars is a non-fiction book by {{lawyer and}} civil libertarian Marjorie Heins <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> {{freedom of speech}} and the {{censorship}} of works of art in the early 1990s by the U.S. government. The book was published in 1993 by The New Press. Heins provides an overview of the history of censorship, including the 1873 Comstock laws, and then moves on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} Nova Muscae 1983, GQ Muscae is a binary system {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and small star <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated the star erupts, {{as it did in}} 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object {{consisting of a}}n orange main-sequence star (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black hole of around 6 solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced through a process of positron annihilation. GR Muscae is an X-ray source composed of a neutron star of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY Muscae is a symbiotic star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, there is no periodic eruption nor accretion disc formed. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days.|$|E

5|$|NGC 772 is {{a spiral}} galaxy with an {{integrated}} magnitude of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 Arietis. It {{is a relatively}} bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a class SA(s)b galaxy, which means {{that it is an}} unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, NGC 770, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the Arp peculiar galaxy catalog. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth. Another spiral galaxy in Aries is NGC 673, a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms. It has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes. It has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core. 171,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 673 is 235 million light-years from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops goodmani {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws): {{one with the}} fourth premolar (p4) and first and second molars (m1–2) and two with {{the second and third}} molars (m2–3). The jaw is {{relatively}} robust. The p4 resembles a canine, having a single cusp <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> as high as the highest cusp on m1 and lacking accessory shelves or cusps. The molars are narrow-crowned and longer than in T.menamena, P.auritus, and P.furculus. Length of m2 ranges from 1.55 to 1.57mm and width from 0.98 to 1.02mm. On m1, the trigonid (front group of cusps) is narrower and slightly higher than the talonid at the back. The protoconid, one of the main cusps in the trigonid, is the highest cusp, but is only slightly higher than the hypoconid (a cusp in the talonid); in living Madagascan Triaenops and Paratriaenops, the protoconid is substantially higher than the hypoconid. The paraconid, metaconid (both cusps in the trigonid), and entoconid (a cusp in the talonid) are lower than in Paratriaenops auritus. The hypoconulid (part of the talonid) is small but distinct and is the lowest cusp. It is separated from the entoconid by a gap. T.goodmani lacks a ridge, the preentocristid, connecting the entoconid to the metaconid. There is a crest (cingulum) at the front and back of the tooth. The last two molars are similar to m1, but in m2 the talonid is only slightly wider than the trigonid and in m3 the two are of equal width. In addition, a shelf is present between the protoconid and hypoconid on m2 and m3 is smaller, lacks the gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid, and has a weak ridge between the entoconid and metaconid. These characteristics are typical of Triaenops and Paratriaenops.|$|E
