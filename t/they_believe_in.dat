5|$|To further {{understand}} {{the mysteries of}} the Foretellers and the future, the player, Chirithy, and Skuld re-enter the Foretellers' tower where they are caught by a Foreteller. They are also told that Ephemer is a traitor to his union and that he has disappeared. The player then challenges the Foreteller to a duel, assuming Ephemer has been captured, but is easily defeated. The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest was a test of their character to see if they are worthy of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for what <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in,</b> like their friends, are worthy of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions and going on to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving. Ira informs the player, Skuld, and Chirithy that the war cannot be avoided and {{that there will be no}} victor. The only Foreteller who may have a solution is Gula so the trio go to look for him.|$|E
25|$|Orang Asli are {{traditionally}} animists, where <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of}} spirits in various objects.

25|$|Agnostic theism is the {{philosophical}} view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism.

The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god(s) <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

Twenty-three percent of Americans identified themselves as not at all religious, nearly double the 12 percent reported in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{view of the}} New Covenant is a new {{relationship}} between God and humans mediated by Jesus which necessarily includes all people, both Jews and Gentiles, upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God.

25|$|The {{ancestors}} {{of many of}} today's Russians adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 10th century. The 2007 International Religious Freedom Report published by the US Department of State said that approximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians. According to a poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 63% of respondents considered themselves Russian Orthodox, 6% of respondents considered themselves Muslim and less than 1% considered themselves either Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. Another 12% said <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God, but did not practice any religion, and 16% said they are non-believers.|$|E

25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs.

25|$|The {{religions}} both share {{a belief}} in the virgin birth of Jesus, his miracles and healings, and that he ascended bodily into heaven. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he was a human being who was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' crucifixion. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never assumed human flesh, they do not accept the use of icons, and see this as shirk (idolatry). Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of iconoclasm and their conquests caused the iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to Muhammad, Jesus, or any other prophets; only to God.|$|E

25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
25|$|When {{his team}} member, Jaime, is kidnapped and {{tortured}} by Max, Jaime signals {{the rest of}} the JLI to lead them to Max's headquarters. The JLI arrives too late, and Jaime is shot in the head by Max, killing him {{in the same manner as}} his predecessor, Ted Kord. Booster Gold is enraged and his team tries to take down Max, but Max escapes from the JLI using one of his headquarters' escape pods. The JLI carries Jaime to the land surface, where paramedics try to resuscitate him. However, their efforts fail as Jaime had already died. As the team deals with the loss of Jaime, Booster Gold blames himself for leading the team into so much danger, and wants to abdicate as leader. The rest of the team overhear his ranting and convince him that <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> him. Gold is still upset, saying they cannot win against Max, when Blue Beetle suddenly sits up, his wound healed, declaring he knows Max's ultimate plans and that they can stop him.|$|E
25|$|Simeo Ondeto {{is known}} as the Lodvikus or The Glory of God, whose role is to bring the world to {{understand}} the hidden treasures of life after death and dramatise the reality of eternal life. According to Legio Maria the promise by Jesus to return has been fulfilled by the coming of Simeo. Legio Maria also seems not to believe in a final judgement of the whole world. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> immediate judgement of individuals immediately after death. This is supported by the long list of adored Legio saints. Some of the official Legio Maria saints include Timotheo Atila, Maria Ombwayo, Tobias Oongo, Petro Otieno, Mumbo Carilus and Angi Clement. Church leaders distinguish Messias Simeo Ondeto's mission as separate from that of Jesus. He was not sent to replace Jesus, for Jesus was a name given to the son of God when he accomplished a second dispensational mission. Instead, Messias Simeo Ondeto is God incarnated in another context, specifically for the third dispensation of the glory of God. Often, 1 John 4:1 is used as biblical support for the confession that God has again come into the flesh through Messias Simeo Ondeto, for “every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God…Therefore we say that Jesus has come in the flesh.|$|E
