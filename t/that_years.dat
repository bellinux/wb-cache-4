After returning from All Blacks duty, he played for Canterbury and contributed to a Ranfurly Shield win over Waitako. Canterbury then reached the NPC final, giving Hammett {{the opportunity to be}} part of a Super 12, Ranfurly Shield, and NPC winning team, all in the same year. Wellington won the NPC final however, and the opportunity was lost. Hammett was then {{selected for the}} end-of-year All Blacks tour, and played against France and Italy (both as a substitute).|$|E
5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed <b>that,</b> <b>years</b> ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as they crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents {{have been known to}} supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown <b>that</b> <b>years</b> with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.|$|E

While attending the fair, he observed an observation balloon tethered at an altitude of 1,000 feet (305 meters) and glider demonstrations by William Avery, an associate of the noted aviation pioneer Octave Chanute. Despite the failure of Berrys aircraft, what Benoist saw at the fair piqued his interest in aviation, and he oriented his future career toward it.|$|E

25|$|The 2001 NPS {{study also}} {{collected}} and analyzed soil samples at the moss-collection sites: no {{elevated levels of}} lead or cadmium were detected. Additional studies conclude that the concentrations of heavy metals detected in water, soil, caribou, fish, and berry samples collected from the Red Dog mine area do not pose a public health hazard. It is generally agreed <b>that</b> <b>years</b> of operation of tarp-top haul trucks (one every 15 minutes) carrying lead-zinc concentrate resulted in lead and cadmium-bearing dust contamination {{along the edges of}} the haul road. Fortunately this poor practice has not resulted in a threat to human safety. The entire concentrate-haulage system has been improved, including tight-fitting seals on side-dump trucks and enclosure of conveyor belts at the port site.|$|E
25|$|Oribin {{designed}} {{all aspects}} of the church, including internal fixtures and furnishings, and his attention to detail led him to personally craft some items. Timber furniture included the baptismal font, lectern, pulpit, candle holders, stools and pews. A pair of aumbry cupboard doors, depicting stylised interpretations of Saints Peter and Paul, were designed and routed by Oribin himself. Oribin also personally produced seven acid-etched copper panels, each depicting one of the sacraments, to ornament the baptismal font lid. Other copper work for the sanctuary lights, candle holders and spun copper font were designed by Oribin and produced in Sydney. His work was so valued by the Proserpine congregation <b>that,</b> <b>years</b> after the church was completed, Oribin was contacted by them to design and detail a simple noticeboard.|$|E
25|$|When Alice Liddell {{was a young}} woman, she {{set out on a}} grand tour of Europe with Lorina and Edith. One {{story has}} it that she became a romantic {{interest}} of Prince Leopold, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, during the four years he spent at Christ Church, but the evidence for this is sparse. It is true <b>that</b> <b>years</b> later, Leopold named his first child Alice, and acted as godfather to Alice's second son Leopold. (A recent biographer of Leopold suggests it is far more likely that Alice's sister Edith was the true recipient of Leopold's attention.) Edith died on 26 June 1876, possibly of measles or peritonitis (accounts differ), shortly before she was to be married to Aubrey Harcourt, a cricket player. At her funeral on 30 June 1876, Prince Leopold served as a pall-bearer.|$|E

25|$|In 1841 the {{population}} of Fintona was 1327 with another 7980 {{people living in the}} surrounding hinterland of the civil parish of Donacavey. However the effects of the Irish Famine of the 1840s meant that by 1851, {{the population}} in the village rose to 1504 with the population in the rest of Donacavey falling to 5972. Nevertheless, this was to mark the start of a continual fall in population, in common with much of rural Ireland, that by 1891 the population in the village fell to 1271 with 3551 in the remainder of Donacavey, a rate that continued to slowly fall until the middle of the 20th century. By 1971 {{the population of}} Fintona was recorded in <b>that</b> <b>years</b> census as 1190, rising to 1353 in 1981 but then falling slightly to 1324 in 1991.

25|$|One of Port Adelaide's finest players {{during the}} Fos Williams era was John Cahill. He {{eventually}} became William's protégé and ultimately {{took over as}} coach in 1974. In 1975 a dispute between the Port Adelaide City Council and the SANFL {{over the use of}} Alberton Oval forced Port Adelaide to move its home matches to Adelaide Oval for two seasons. In 1976 Cahill would subsequently take Port Adelaide to its first Grand Final under his leadership against Sturt with an official attendance of 66,897, the record for football in South Australia. The actual crowd was estimated at 80,000, much bigger than the official figure as Football Park ran out of tickets early and were forced to shut the gates 90 minutes before the bounce as people were being crushed on entry. Sturt won in an upset by 41 points. In 1977 the dispute regarding Alberton Oval was resolved and the club moved back to its home ground and won <b>that</b> <b>years</b> premiership breaking an 11-year drought which at the time was Port Adelaide longest since competing in an organised football competition.|$|E
