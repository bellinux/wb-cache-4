5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all <b>the</b> <b>carcasses.</b> Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all <b>the</b> <b>carcasses.</b> More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E

5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture.

5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of <b>the</b> <b>carcasses</b> was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} large food falls and carrion on meiobenthic {{communities}} remains little understood. The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate whether <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> of a stingray, encountered fortuitously in an Australian estuary, affects the underlying meiobenthic community, in particular nematode assemblages. The integrity of the skeleton and the low redox values observed under <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> suggest that <b>the</b> cadaver had been slowly and chiefly decomposed by microbes. The abundance and number of meiofaunal taxa, as well as nematode abundance and nematode-species richness, were significantly lower under <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> when compared to samples outside <b>the</b> <b>carcass.</b> Nonetheless, a few nematode species, typical of hypoxic/anoxic sediments, were more abundant under <b>the</b> <b>carcass.</b> Interestingly, all these species were absent or rare in samples near, but not under, <b>the</b> <b>carcass,</b> suggesting that they may take advantage of the reduced environment created by <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> and <b>the</b> consequent lack of competition to prosper.

5|$|Pack-hunting of langurs is {{recorded}} in India. Packs of between 5 and 18 jackals scavenging on <b>the</b> <b>carcasses</b> of large ungulates {{is recorded}} in India and Israel. Packs of 8–12 jackals consisting {{of more than}} one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. In India, the Montagu's harrier and the Pallid harrier roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by scavenging on carrion and garbage, and will cache extra food by burying it. Golden jackals cause damage to melon, peanut, grape, coffee, maize, and sugarcane crops. They sometimes prey on lambs, weak sheep, kids, goats, and poultry. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, dhole, and gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Then as now, Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying <b>the</b> <b>carcasses</b> of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{different methods}} of estimating bovine carcass composition, seventy yearling bulls of the "Asturiana de los Valles" beef breed were slaughtered and their carcass composition estimated by a commercial dissection {{of the right}} half-carcass and by tissular dissection of the 6 th and 10 th rib of the left half-carcass. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the most accurate predictors of carcass composition. In simple regression, the percentage of lean in the 10 th rib was the most accurate predictor (r= 0. 88; P< 0. 001) of the lean proportion in <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> and <b>the</b> percentage of fat in the 6 th rib was the best predictor (r= 0. 90; P< 0. 001) of <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> fat content. <b>The</b> correlation coefficients for estimating the bone percentage in <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> from <b>the</b> bone proportion in the ribs (6 th and 10 th) were low (r= 0. 63 and 0. 51 respectively), although significant (P< 0. 001) and the coefficient improved when the proportion of lean in the ribs was used as predictor (r= 0. 78 and 0. 70 for the 6 th and the 10 th rib respectively). In multiple regression, the addition of more regressors of the rib composition and carcass traits, such as <b>carcass</b> hot weight, <b>the</b> <b>carcass</b> fatness score {{and the weight of}} the kidney knob and channel fat, led to an improvement (P< 0. 05) in accuracy for some predictions.
