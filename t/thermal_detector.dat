50|$|Using a {{handheld}} <b>thermal</b> <b>detector,</b> Matt and Susan drive around the suspect area and find unnatural heat {{coming from a}} warehouse. They enter, but Matt is recognised by Andrew, who then binds them as prisoners. In an effort to produce results, Andrew, by this point, acting in desperation, goes too far and the workers start to desert as flames leap from the drill hole. He tries to seal it but is badly burned by the flames. Meanwhile, Matt and Susan manage to escape as the unleashed lava causes the warehouse to explode. The effects of Andrew's latest efforts are seen {{on the streets of}} New York as lava spouts out of manholes and buildings catch fire, killing thousands and causing untold damage.|$|E
5000|$|Leslie's cube is {{a device}} {{used in the}} {{measurement}} or demonstration of the variations in thermal radiation emitted from different surfaces at the same temperature. It was devised in 1804 by John Leslie (1766-1832), a Scottish mathematician and physicist. [...] In the version of the experiment described by John Tyndall in the late 1800s, one of the cube's vertical sides is coated {{with a layer of}} gold, another with a layer of silver, a third with a layer of copper, while the fourth side is coated with a varnish of isinglass. The cube is made from a solid block of metal with a central cavity. In use, the cavity was filled with hot water; the entire cube has essentially the same temperature as the water. The <b>thermal</b> <b>detector</b> (on the far right in the figure) showed much greater emission from the side with varnish than from any of the other three sides.|$|E

5000|$|Reflected {{solar energy}} was {{measured}} in six channels to sense color caused by absorption due to chlorophyll, sediments, and gelbstoffe in coastal waters. The CZCS used a rotating plane mirror at a 45 degree angle to the optic axis of a Cassegrain telescope. The mirror scanned 360 degrees but only the 80 degrees of data centered on nadir were collected for ocean color measurements. The instrument viewed deep space and calibration sources during {{the remainder of the}} scan. The incoming radiation was collected by the telescope and divided into two streams by a dichroic beam splitter. One stream was transmitted to a field stop that was also the entrance aperture of a small polychromator. The radiance that entered the polychromator was separated and re-imaged in five wavelengths on five silicon detectors in the focal plane of the polychromator. The other stream was directed to a cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector in the thermal region (10.5-12.5 micrometer). A radiative cooler was used to cool the <b>thermal</b> <b>detector.</b> To avoid sun glint, the scanner mirror was tilted about the sensor pitch axis on command so that the line of sight of the sensor was moved in 2-degree increments up to 20 degrees with respect to the nadir. Spectral bands at 0.443 and 0.670 micrometers centered on the most intense absorption bands of chlorophyll, while the band at 0.550 micrometers centered on the [...] "hinge point," [...] the wavelength of minimum absorption. Ratios of measured energies in these channels were shown to closely parallel surface chlorophyll concentrations. Data from the scanning radiometer were processed, with algorithms developed from the field experiment data, to produce maps of chlorophyll absorption. The temperatures of coastal waters and ocean currents were measured in a spectral band centered at 11.5 micrometers. Observations were made also in two other spectral bands, 0.520 micrometers for chlorophyll correlation and 0.750 micrometers for surface vegetation. The scan width was 1556 km centered on nadir and the ground resolution was 0.825 km at nadir.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>detectors</b> have {{historically}} been the sensors of choice for applications where photoconductive or photovoltaic detectors are unavailable. While they {{have the advantage of}} broad wavelength coverage, a primary disadvantage has been sensitivity; at a given operating temperature, bolometers are typically much less sensitive than photodetectors. The development of cryogenic bolometers has resulted in <b>thermal</b> <b>detectors</b> which can reach fundamental sensitivity limits. When operated at temperatures below 0. 3 K these devices can provide background-limited sensitivity for cryogenic imaging and spectroscopy in space. The past decade has seen a rapid growth in sensitivity and array format in cryogenic bolometers. Micromachining technology, combined with advances in superconducting electronics, provides a strong technological base for future developments.

40|$|We {{have further}} {{developed}} and demonstrated the novel ORNL micro-calorimetric spectroscopy technique for the detections and characterization of toxic organic substances. In this technique target molecules {{were allowed to}} adsorb {{on the surface of}} sub-femtojoule sensitive micromechanical thermal detectors. The adsorption of molecules on the <b>thermal</b> <b>detector</b> surface causes a differential surface stress resulting in an initial ''trigger''. By exposing the <b>thermal</b> <b>detector</b> microstructure elements to different photon wavelengths, an extremely sensitive and unique photothermal signature response was obtained. We adsorbed sub-monolayer levels of target chemicals onto the bi-material detector surfaces. We obtained infrared photothermal spectra for trace concentrations of several organics such as diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), and trinitrotoluene (TNT) over the wavelength region 2. 5 to 14. 5 {micro}m. We found that in the wavelength region 2. 5 to 14. 5 {micro}m the photothermal spectra of DIMP and TNT exhibit a number of peaks and are in excellent agreement with traditional infrared absorption spectra found in the literature. Chemical detectors based on micro-calorimetric spectroscopy can be used to sensitively sense {{a relatively small number of}} molecules adsorbed on a <b>thermal</b> <b>detector</b> surface.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{excellent}} results obtained by mechanical decoupling of our <b>thermal</b> <b>detectors</b> from the cryostat. The {{starting point of}} this work is the necessity to improve the performances of <b>thermal</b> <b>detectors</b> and, besides, to eliminate the non-constant noise resulting from the overall cryogenic facility; this second point results to be crucial for rare-events experiments and the fundamental task for Dark Matter search. Tested on our bolometer, consisting of a 750 g tellurium oxide absorber coupled with an NTD thermistor and operated at similar to 9 mK in an Oxford 200 dilution refrigerator, this powerful technique can, moreover, provide advantages for a large variety of <b>thermal</b> <b>detectors.</b> A good energy resolution of 3. 9 keV FWHM was obtained for 2. 615 MeV gamma-rays. The 4. 2 keV average FWHM resolution for the 5407 keV Po- 210 alpha decay line is the best ever obtained for alpha-particles with any type of detector. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.
