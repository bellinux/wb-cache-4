40|$|Turbine blades have complex {{geometries}} with free form surface. Blades have different thickness at the trailing and leading edges {{as well as}} sharp bends at the chord-tip shroud junction and sharp fins at the <b>tip</b> <b>shroud.</b> In investment <b>casting</b> of blades, shrinkage at the tip-shroud and cord junction is a common casting problem. Because of high temperature applications, grain structure is also critical in these castings {{in order to avoid}} creep. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of different process parameters, such as, shell thickness, insulation and casting temperature on shrinkage porosity and grain size. The test geometry used in this study was a thin-walled air-foil structure which is representative of a typical hot-gas-path rotating turbine component. It was observed that, in thin sections, increased shell thickness helps to increase the feeding distance and thus avoid interdendritic shrinkage. It was also observed that grain size is not significantly affected by shell thickness in thin sections. Slower cooling rate due to the added insulation and steeper thermal gradient at metal mold interface induced by the thicker shell not only helps to avoid shrinkage porosity but also increases fill-ability in thinner sections...|$|R

40|$|Flow through <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity in a {{representative}} axial turbine vane-rotor stage environment is assessed for {{its role in}} loss generation and turbine durability. Steady and unsteady three-dimensional flow computations, complemented by control volume analyses, for varying shroud configurations provided results for establishing quantitative links between loss and ow processes as well as loss level scalings. Specifically <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity flow is dominated by two counter-rotating vortices upstream, and a free expansion leakage jet downstream, of the tip seal, followed by a mixing shear layer at cavity exit. One of the vortices, the cavity inlet toroidal vortex, sets the loss level within the cavity inlet and the mass ow recirculated out of the cavity into the main flow path. It is found that <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity flow incurs a 0 : 85 % debit in stage eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity with approximately 50 % generated in the free expansion of the tip seal leakage jet and 50 % from cavity exit mixing. The proportion of total loss attributable to cavity exit mixing increases with tip seal gap. In addition, vane-rotor unsteady interaction induces an additional 0 : 25 % debit in eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity. The additional efficiency penalty induced by vane-rotor unsteady interaction results from an enhancement of the cavity inlet toroidal vortex and associated recirculated mass flow. Overall cavity loss is set by cavity mass flow fraction, stagnation pressure ratio across tip seal, velocity disparity between cavity exit flow and rotor exit flow, and cavity inlet vortex strength. These findings were used to formulate a modified <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> configuration that nearly eliminates cavity exit mixing loss, but it incurs a penalty associated with cavity flow low Reynolds number effects and induced mismatching between vane and modified <b>tip</b> <b>shroud.</b> In the process of designing this modified <b>tip</b> <b>shroud,</b> {{it was found that}} the turbine main flow perceives the cavity as a line sink-source pair, permitting estimation of flow redistribution in the main flow path. Finally, any operational transients which eliminate tip seal clearance would lead to enhanced impingement heat transfer at blade tip due to recirculating ow from cavity inlet; this can increase the likelihood of blade failure. by Timothy R.

With the coolant system inactivated, the honeycomb shroud caused a decrease in efficiency of 2. 3 points. These results and those obtained from a small reference turbine indicate that the dominant factor governing honeycomb <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> loss is the ratio of honeycomb depth to blade span.

The engine test data provided input to a thermomechanical analysis to predict temperature and stress profiles throughout the ceramic gas-path seal. The analysis predicts cyclic thermal stresses large enough to cause the seal to fail.

A unique, very complex design; the T-stage, which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the main fan rotor.

These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor.

The economic rationale for repair in lieu of replacement is prima facie. The metallurgical rationale is less certain, but satisfactory flight performance over the past twenty-five years at least attests to the technical adequacy of blade and vane repairs.

On average, high-pressure turbine blades undergo two repair cycles before replacement. Low-pressure turbine blades similarly require repair but are replaced less frequently. Dimensional restoration of a subtly distorted component to demanding original equipment standards is a real engineering challenge.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} "greener" turbomachines stands in direct {{conflict}} with mechanical integrity aspects as lighter and more highly loaded components {{are more likely}} to vibrate and high cycles fatigue failures could occur. In aircraft engines the blade resonant vibration amplitude is normally reduced by increasing the structural damping. An extremely effective method to increase the structural damping is to dissipate energy between contact surfaces, for example in the dovetail attachment or between <b>tip</b> <b>shrouds.</b> The energy is dissipated in the contacts where a friction force and a relative displacement, called slip, arise. Both fluid dynamics and structural dynamics methods have become important tools for estimating specific phenomena in turbomachinery aeromechanics such as determination of the maximum amplitude magnifications, flutter margins determination, excitation levels at different engine orders and so on. However, it is not fully clear what would be the accuracy expected while using these methods for predicting the overall fatigue failure risk. The main challenge to validate the assessment from numerical code is to overcome the difficulties in determining the model parameters such as the excitation force level, the aerodynamic damping and the structural damping. A special test rig, Fig. 1, have been develop in order to measure the structural damping due to the friction joints in an engine-like bladed disk at different excitation levels and engine orders. The test rig is made of two co-axial rotors; the first rotor is the engine-like bladed disk under investigation, made with 146 aluminum blades, the second rotor carries the excitation system, Fig. 2, made with 24 permanent magnets.

Tests on a low speed single this instrumentation have given new evidence on rotor behaviour. The rotor blade performance with steady inlet flow condition was assessed from surveys of total pressure, static pressure and flow direction made upstream and downstreäm of the rotor hub, mid-height and tip section. In addition, measurements of the static pressure distributions of the same blade sections were completed. It is concluded that the combined effect of centrifugal force and annulus wall boundary layer skewing aid {{the performance of the}} rotor. This suggests that the efficiency of compressors would be improved if they were designed for reactions of rather more than 50 %. The presence of a <b>tip</b> <b>shroud</b> has the effect of enhancing the overall compressor performance. A comparison of compressor rotor and two-dimensional cascade blade results is given, and predictions of the boundary layer development and the pressure distribution around the blades under various flow conditions are also presented. A series of experiments were also conducted at the mid-height section in which the compressor was subjected to 'sine-wave' and 'square-wave' circumferential stagnation pressure distortions including tests with the compressor operating in the surge regime. The deteriorating effect of total pressure distortion on overall compressor performance is clearly demonstrated, and a critical sector of spoiling is found. The effect of the level of reduced frequency on the unsteady normal force response of rotor blades is shown. II In all cases of distorted inlet flow, stallwinception is dela ed until values of normal force coefficient are reached well in excess of those encountered at steady state maximum. For 'square-wave' type distortion this is ensued by a complex stall situation with separation bubbles apparently traversing the rotor blade section and promoting dynamic lift patterns which pass through secondary and tertiary peaks. One may conclude that the aerodynamic rotor behaviour in the presence of such an unsteady flow environment is not predictable by current mathematical models. A theoretical analysis of the transient flow applicable at low values of reduced frequency is given. The transient response of the pressure-transmitting system was examined thoroughly theoretically, and experimental frequency response tests were conducted on the rotor blades as well as on a subsidiary rig. Careful examination of the fluctuating pressure signal was performed including time and frequency analyses...|$|R

Technologies showing considerable promise as to benefits, low development costs, and high probability of success were thermal barrier coating, directionally solidified eutectic turbine blades, and abrasive-tip blades/ceramic-shroud turbine systems...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{pressure}} difference between the blade pressure and suction side, hot gas leaks through {{the gap between the}} blade <b>tip</b> and the <b>shroud.</b> This flow, called leakage flow, causes thin bound-ary layer and high heat transfer coefficient on the blade tip. The hot leakage flow is the major cause of blade tip failures. To reduce the leakage flow and heat transfer on the tip, the blades of modern gas turbines typically have a recessed cavity at the tip and are called squealer tip blades. The cavity acts as a labyrinth seal to increase flow resistance and thus reduces leakage flow. Recently, many experimental studies for the squealer tip blade have been conducted in a cascade environment. Azad et al...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} thrust to weight ratio and efficiency of modern gas turbines, engine designers are always interested in increasing turbine operating temperatures. The benefits are attributed {{to the fact that}} higher temperature gases yield a higher energy potential. However, the detrimental effects on the components along the hot gas path can offset the benefits of increasing the operating temperature. The HPT first stage blade is one component that is extremely vulnerable to the hot gas. The cause for tip failures are fairly well understood and can be explained as follows. A clearance gap between the rotating blade <b>tip</b> and stationary <b>shroud</b> is necessary to allow for the blade’s mechanical and thermal growth during operation. Unfortunately, the gap allows for leakage flo...|$|R
