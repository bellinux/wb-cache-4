500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E

30|$|During the mid-eighteenth century, Norwich and London were {{pre-eminent}} in the dyeing industry: the two centres dyed {{and finished}} {{most of the}} fine worsted goods produced in the country. John James, an historian of the English worsted industry, attributed a ‘beauty and permanence’ to Norwich dyes, {{so much so that}} manufacturers from all over England chose to send <b>their</b> <b>stuffs</b> to the city [4].|$|R
500|$|In late 1999, Ivory began portraying a more {{conservative}} character. On January 23, 2000 at the Royal Rumble, she grudgingly {{took part in the}} [...] "Miss Royal Rumble" [...] swimsuit contest, which was won by Mae Young. She challenged Jacqueline for the WWF Women's Championship on March 9, but she was unsuccessful. After an absence, Ivory returned to WWF television in September 2000 {{as a member of a}} villainous alliance of conservative wrestlers known as Right to Censor. The change in character saw her don less suggestive ring attire and {{more conservative}} hairstyles. Ivory quickly began a rivalry with Women's Champion Lita, winning the Women's Championship for the third time by defeating Lita, Jacqueline, and Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four-Way match. She retained the title against Lita at the Survivor Series on November 19, with the assistance of Right to Censor leader Steven Richards, in a match that SLAM! Wrestling claimed [...] "illustrated to what heights women's wrestling is capable of reaching in North America if the right talent is permitted to strut <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> in a wrestling ring and not a pit full of jello." [...] Ivory also retained her title in a Triple Threat match against Stratus and Molly Holly at Armageddon on December 10.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Salon, David Sirota, a {{progressive}} political commentator compared The Dark Knight Rises {{and the game}} Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: [...] "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected {{the spirit of the}} Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist." [...] An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the co-creator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is [...] "far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically." [...] Catherine Shoard of the center-left British publication The Guardian claimed the film [...] "is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they say they want to do good." [...] In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that [...] "What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> might be excessive." [...] Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane [...] "the ultimate occupier" [...] and reported that Christian Bale was amazed that the script had [...] "foreseen" [...] the Occupy movement.|$|E
500|$|Weird Tales {{included}} a letters column, titled [...] "The Eyrie", {{for most of}} its existence, and during Wright's time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters. [...] When Brundage's nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, with the two sides divided about equally. [...] For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine's letter column. [...] Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn, [...] Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard's stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as [...] "Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk". [...] Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include. [...] Until Amazing Stories was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with Weird Tales readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror. [...] The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in Weird Tales. [...] Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on [...] "The Eyrie" [...] in a letter to a fellow writer: [...] "No other magazine makes such a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> is received".|$|E

2500|$|Holly Brook (who {{was signed}} to Shinoda's record label Machine Shop Recordings) and Jonah Matranga were {{featured}} {{artists of the}} song. Shinoda requested Brook to sing the chorus, since Shinoda had already written the entire song. Brook recorded the song for half an hour. Shinoda praised her vocals, calling her voice as [...] "unbelievable." [...] Shinoda affirmed the Brook's musical style [...] "really rooted in the songwriting...You don't need all the frills and the production. You can put her on a $50 mic {{in a room and}} she sounds just like the record because the talent is really there. A lot of artists rely on tricks to make <b>their</b> <b>stuff</b> sound a certain way, but we all appreciate the rawness of what she does." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was quite}} a game, sorting out the real women from the false. Some were easy. They had <b>stuffed</b> <b>their</b> bosoms, and <b>stuffed</b> <b>their</b> bustles, and put on hats and very various robes, and they minced along with little jigging steps, like little dolls that dangle from elastic, and they put their heads {{on one side and}} dripped their hands, and danced up to flurry the actual young ladies, and {{sometimes}} they received a good clout on the head, when they broke into wild and violent gestures, whereat the actual young ladies scuffled wildly.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the banks}} of the Vistula river, teams had to {{recreate}} a story in Polish mythology about the Wawel Dragon. As in the story, teams had to stuff a lamb with sulphur.

After stuffing and sewing the lamb closed, teams had to have it weighed on a scale near a statue of the Wawel Dragon.
