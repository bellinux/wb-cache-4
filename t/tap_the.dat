5|$|Several Australian species {{practice}} acoustic and vibration {{behavior as}} {{an aspect of}} courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} a potential mate, some cockroaches <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics.|$|E
5|$|Soft drinks firm Fraser & Neave (F) {{acquired}} {{the site in}} 1922, {{and set up a}} bottling plant at nearby Semangat Ayer to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> mineral water, which they labelled Seletaris. During the Second World War, the spring's flow was temporarily interrupted when a bomb fell near the well during a Japanese air raid over Singapore in 1942. After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese military seized the place and converted it into recreational thermal baths (onsen).|$|E

5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Marostica {{was named}} to {{a seat on the}} legislature's Joint Budget Committee, and a seat on the House Appropriations Committee as the ranking Republican member. During hearings before the beginning of the legislative session, Marostica supported withdrawing all state funding from public research universities, a move opposed by university leaders, but which was discussed more seriously after poor economic forecasts. Marostica also helped to lead an effort to allow the state to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> financial reserves of Pinnacol Assurance, a quasi-governmental worker's compensation insurer, in order to balance the state budget. Following the legislative session, Marostica served on Colorado's Long-Term Fiscal Stability Commission, a panel created by legislation during the 2009 General Assembly to consider changes to constitutional constraints on the state budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the tournament Paris Saint-Germain beat Valencia by three goals. The French club had made five changes to the side that lost against Arsenal, which worked to their favour as Amara Diané and David N'Gog each scored inside 30 minutes. Valencia {{struggled}} to match their opponents' intensity, though remained a threat with Fernando Morientes' arrival in the second half. The match was settled with five minutes remaining of normal time; Luyindula, on as a substitute, received a pass from Loris Arnaud which drew goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand out of his area and allowed the French striker to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> ball into an empty net.|$|E
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E

Other radio channels such as KK FM is operated by Universiti Malaysia Sabah, while Bayu FM is only available through Astro, the Malaysian main satellite television. Several newly independent radio station have been {{launched in the}} state, namely Kupi-Kupi FM in 2016, KK12FM and VOKFM in 2017. Other Peninsular-based radio stations also had set up their offices {{in the state to}} <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> emerging market. Sabahan DJs are mostly hired and local state songs will be played to meet Sabahan listeners taste and slang. Television broadcasting in the state are divided into terrestrial and satellite television. As Malaysia aims for digital television transition, all analogue signal will be shutdown soon. There is two types of free-to-air television provider such as MYTV Broadcasting (digital terrestrial) and Astro NJOI (satellite).

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
