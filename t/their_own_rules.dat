5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> Sheffield {{remained}} {{the centre of the}} footballing world until the onset of professionalism. The association matches versus London were considered only equalled in importance to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final. Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937. In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football.|$|E
25|$|Although {{universities}} and student unions each had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules,</b> students generally {{were required to}} become a member of their campus student organisation automatically upon enrolment. A fee for student services or amenities was charged to students, typically once a semester, once a year, or in a lump sum upon enrolment. This fee was typically collected by the university, which usually took a portion in collection fees and passed the rest to campus student organisation(s). These organisations then distributed the money according to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

25|$|The new law {{aimed at}} harmonizing the Soviet republics' {{copyright}} laws, which had {{in some areas}} drifted apart over the years. This was achieved by making the 1991 Fundamentals more explicit and giving the republics less leeway to devise <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

60|$|But the {{greatest}} abuse of all is, that these creatures are become <b>their</b> <b>own</b> lawgivers; nay, I {{think they are}} ours too, though nobody would imagine that such a set of slatterns should bamboozle a whole nation; but it is neither better nor worse, they hire themselves to you by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|R

25|$|States {{are also}} {{protected}} against lawsuits by their sovereign immunity. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless have <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state.

50|$|The {{prosperity}} {{of the region and}} its high agricultural and manufacturing output made it an object of contest between the leaders of the early conquering Arab armies.

Sweden only enters athletes good enough to reach at least the eighth position, based on an assessment by the Swedish NOC.|$|E

25|$|In the 1951 case, the Indian Claims Commission {{acknowledged}} {{there might}} have been discrimination by the tribe against certain mixed-blood descendants such as Barada; however, the court dismissed the case {{on the grounds that the}} Indian Claims Commission did not have jurisdiction over a group claim of individual members; rather, its responsibilities were to adjudicate claims of tribes against the government.

50|$|Dinklage Castle {{was built}} by the counts of the Dersagau of Calvelage around 980; the name Dinklage was first officially {{recorded}} in 1231 (first as Thinclage, later Dynclage, and, by 1270, Dinklage). In 1080, the castle {{was given to the}} Herren von Dinklage ("lords of Dinklage"), who became the noble family of Dincklage.

25|$|The {{territory}} of Cyrenaica {{was characterized by}} {{the contrast between the}} coastal towns of the Pentapolis, inhabited by Greeks, and the territories inhabited by Libyans.

In some of these cities there was a huge minority of the population made of Hebrews, who were organized with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b> The few Roman citizens in the province were organized into the Conventus civium Romanorum.|$|E
25|$|The general {{copyright}} term {{changed with}} each {{revision of the}} law. The 1925 Fundamentals had defined that copyrights subsisted for 25 years since the first publication of a work.

The 1961 Fundamentals reduced this to the lifetime of the author, but allowed individual republics to devise <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b> The Fundamentals also made mention of the inheritance of copyrights. The Russian SFSR defined in its chapter IV of the 1964 RSFSR Civil Code a copyright term of 15 years p.m.a.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s an {{expatriate}} named John Miller {{who worked}} on the railway construction project in São Paulo together with some 3000 other immigrant families from the British Isles in the last decades of the 19th century, decided to send his young boy Charles William Miller to England for his education. In 1884 Charles aged 10 was sent to Bannisters school in Southampton. Charles was a natural footballer who quickly picked up the arts of the game. The football association was being formed at the time. Eton, Rugby, Charterhouse and other colleges all had developed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> to the game. As an accomplished winger and striker Charles held school honours that were to gain him entry first into the Southampton Club team and then into the County team of Hampshire.|$|E

50|$|The king list {{asserts that}} Akkad was then conquered, and the hegemony {{returned}} to Uruk following his reign. It further lists six names of an Uruk dynasty; however {{none of these}} six rulers has been confirmed through archaeology.
