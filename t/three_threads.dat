Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes <b>three</b> <b>threads</b> into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill.

40|$|The screw stress {{concentration}} for six nut-bolt connections embodying <b>three</b> different <b>thread</b> profiles and two nut shapes is measured photoelastically. Buttress (nearly zero flank angle), trapezoidal (15 -deg flank angle), and triangular (30 -deg flank angle) thread forms are examined {{in combination with}} standard and lip-type nuts. The effect of the thread profile on the screw {{stress concentration}} appears to be dependent upon the kind of nut considered. If the fastening incorporates a standard nut, the buttress thread is stronger than the triangular one, which, in turn, behaves better than the trapezoidal contour. The improvement is roughly a 20 -percent reduction in the stress concentration factor from the trapezoidal to the buttress thread. In the case of lip nut, conversely, this tendency is somewhat reversed, with the trapezoidal thread performing slightly (but not decidedly) {{better than the other}} two shapes. Finally, averaged over all <b>three</b> <b>thread</b> forms, the lip nut exhibits a stress concentration factor which is about 50 percent lower than that of the standard nut...|$|R
