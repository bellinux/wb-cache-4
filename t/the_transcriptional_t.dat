40|$|The major immediate-early (MIE) gene {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) encodes several MIE proteins (MIEPs) produced {{as a result}} of alternative splicing and polyadenylation of the primary transcript. Previously we demonstrated that the HCMV MIEPs expressed from the entire MIE gene could rescue <b>the</b> temperature-sensitive (<b>ts)</b> <b>transcriptional</b> defect in <b>the</b> <b>ts</b> 13 cell line. This defect is caused by a ts mutation in TAFII 250, the 250 -kDa TATA binding protein-associated factor (TAF). These and other data suggested that the MIEPs perform a TAF-like function in complex with the basal transcription factor TFIID. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> defect, <b>the</b> <b>ts</b> mutation in ts 13 cells results in a defect in cell cycle progression which ultimately leads to apoptosis. Since all of these defects can be rescued by wild-type TAFII 250, we asked whether the MIEPs could rescue the cell cycle defect and/or affect the progression to apoptosis. We have found that the MIEPs, expressed from the entire MIE gene, do not rescue the cell cycle block in ts 13 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature. However, despite the maintenance of the cell cycle block, the ts 13 cells which express the MIEPs are resistant to apoptosis. MIEP mutants, which have previously been shown to be defective in rescuing <b>the</b> <b>ts</b> <b>transcriptional</b> defect, maintained <b>the</b> ability to inhibit apoptosis. Hence, the MIEP functions which affect transcription appear to be separable from the functions which inhibit apoptosis. We discuss these data {{in the light of the}} HCMV life cycle and the possibility that the MIEPs promote cellular transformation by a “hit-and-run” mechanism...|$|R

However, data on disruption of thyroid signaling are fragmentary, particularly {{at the molecular level}}. Thyroid hormone (TH; triiodothyronine, T 3) acts principally by modulating transcription from target genes; thus, thyroid signaling is particularly amenable to analysis with a <b>transcriptional</b> assay. Also, <b>T</b> 3 orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis, thereby providing an exceptional model for identifying thyroid-disrupting chemicals. We combined these two advantages to develop a method for following and quantifying <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> action of <b>T</b> 3 in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. This technology provides a means of assessing thyroid activity at the molecular level in a physiologically relevant situation. Moreover, translucent tadpoles are amenable to "on-line" imaging with fluorescent reporter constructs that facilitate in vivo measurement of transcriptional activity. We adapted transgenesis with TH-responsive elements coupled to either luciferase or green fluorescent protein to follow T 3 -dependent transcription in vivo. To reduce time of exposure and to synchronize responses, we optimized a physiologic pretreatment protocol that induced competence to respond to T 3 and thus to assess T 3 effects and T 3 disruption within 48 hr.

However, <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> profile of DCs educated by T cells in allergy is unknown. Methods: In the present study, we have examined <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> profiles of DCs after stimulation with grass pollen allergens, Phleum pratense and coculture with autologous CD 4 + memory T cells using high-density microarray. Protein analysis was performed using flow cytometry and recombinant antibody protein microarrays. Patients with allergic rhinitis and healthy subjects were compared. Results: The results reveal a distinct T-cell-induced DC profile in atopic individuals. Accordingly, about 170 genes were upregulated and 40 genes downregulated. For example, the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD 30 were upregulated in DCs derived from atopic donors, and this could also be verified at the protein level. Conclusion: We conclude that crosstalk between CD 4 + memory T cells and autologous DCs induces transcriptional reprogramming in DCs.

One of the predominant mechanisms used by nuclear receptors to activate or repress target-gene transcription is the recruitment of coregulatory factors capable of covalently modify the amino terminal ends of histones. Here we show that the thyroid hormone (T 3) produces a rapid increase in histone H 3 Ser 10 phosphorylation (H 3 Ser 10 ph) concomitant to the rapid displacement of the heterochromatin protein 1 (P 1) to the nuclear periphery. Moreover, we found that T 3 -mediated pituitary gene transcription is associated with an increase in H 3 Ser 10 ph. Interestingly, theAurora kinase B inhibitor ZM 443979 abolishes the effect of T 3 onH 3 Ser 10 ph, blocks HP 1 delocalization, and significantly reduces ligand-dependent transactivation. Similar effects were shownwhenAurora kinase B expressionwas abrogated in small interferingRNAassays. In an effort to understand the underlyingmechanism bywhich T 3 increases H 3 Ser 10 ph, we demonstrate that ligan-ded thyroid hormone receptor directly interacts with Aurora kinase B, increasing its kinase activity.

Transcription factors in the RpoH family of bacterial alternative s factors usually control gene expression during a heat shock response. Interestingly, several a-proteobacteria possess two or more paralogs of RpoH, suggesting some functional distinction. We investigated the target promoters of Rhodobacter sphaeroides RpoHI and RpoHII using genome-scale data derived from gene expression profiling and the direct interactions of each protein with DNA in vivo. We found that the RpoHI and RpoHII regulons have both distinct and overlapping gene sets. We predicted DNA sequence elements that dictate promoter recognition specificity by each RpoH paralog. We found that several bases in the highly conserved TTG in the 235 element are important for activity with both RpoH homologs; that the T- 9 position, which is over-represented in the RpoHI promoter sequence logo, is critical for RpoHI–dependent transcription; and that several bases in the predicted 210 element were important for activity with either RpoHII or both RpoH homologs. Genes that are transcribed by both RpoHI and RpoHII are predicted to encode for functions involved in general cell maintenance.

The principal effect of simultaneous engagement of CD 28 was to increase the amplitude of <b>the</b> CD 3 <b>transcriptional</b> response. <b>The</b> induced genes whose expression was most enhanced by costimulation were significantly enriched for known targets of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors.

Its predicted product lacks any recognized nucleic acid–binding motif but is homologous to a global negative transcriptional regulator, CDC 36 (NOT 2), from yeast. Rga also acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation, suggesting that a possible function of Rga could be mediation of an interaction between chromatin proteins and <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> complex. <b>T</b> RANSCRIPTIONAL initiation is controlled by the presence and activity of specific nuclear factors that directly bind to the short sequence motifs in the promoter regions of genes, thus, interacting with components of the general transcription machinery.

Their function is to mediate the interaction of transcription factors with the RNA polymerase II complex or to establish or maintain the proper chromatin structure.

Using two in vivo models, we show that Wnt/β-catenin signalling is transiently inhibited at the time of NC delamination. In attempting to define the mechanism underlying this inhibition, we found that the scaffold proteins Dact 1 and Dact 2, which are expressed in pre-migratory NC cells, are required for NC delamination in Xenopus and chick embryos, whereas they do not affect the motile properties of migratory NC cells.

Furthermore, the transcription of Tff 1 (encoding a motogenic lectin) and other secretory genes was analyzed, i. e., gastrokines (Gkn), IgG Fc binding protein (Fcgbp), and the mucin Muc 2. The corresponding gene products belong to an interactome protecting mucous epithelia. Tff 1 was significantly induced after infection, which might increase the motility of immune cells. In contrast, Gkn 3, Fcgbp, and Muc 2 were downregulated seven days after oral infection; whereas four weeks after i. p. infection only Gkn 3 remained downregulated. This might be an indication that Gkn 3, Fcgbp, and Muc 2 are involved in the transient disruption of the splenic architecture and its reorganization, which is characteristic after T. gondii infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the murine interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor � chain/CD 25 is strongly induced at <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> level after <b>T</b> cell activation. We show here that nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) factors {{are involved in the}} control of CD 25 promoter induction in T cells. NF-ATp and NF-ATc bind to two sites around positions � 585 and � 650 located upstream of the proximal CD 25 promoter. Immediately 3 � from these NF-AT motifs, nonconsensus sites are located for the binding of AP- 1 –like factors. Mutations of sites that suppress NF-AT binding impair the induction and strong NF-ATp–mediated transactivation of the CD 25 promoter in T cells. In T lymphocytes from NF-ATp–deficient mice, the {{expression of}} CD 25 is severely impaired, leading to a delayed IL- 2 receptor expression after T cell receptor (TCR) /CD 3 stimulation. Our data indicate an important role for NF-AT in the faithful expression of high affinity IL- 2 receptors and a close link between the TCR-mediated induction of IL- 2 and IL- 2 receptor � chain promoters, both of which are regulated by NF-AT factors.

40|$|Background: Cutaneous mycoses {{are common}} human infections among healthy and immunocompromised hosts, and the {{anthropophilic}} fungus Trichophyton rubrum {{is the most}} prevalent microorganism isolated from such clinical cases worldwide. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> profile of <b>T.</b> rubrum exposed to various stimuli in order to obtain insights into the responses of this pathogen to different environmental challenges. Therefore, we generated an expressed sequence tag (EST) collection by constructing one cDNA library and nine suppression subtractive hybridization libraries. Results: The 1388 unigenes identified in this study were functionally classified based on the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) categories. The identified proteins were involved in transcriptional regulation, cellular defense and stress, protein degradation, signaling, transport, and secretion, among other functions. Analysis of these unigenes revealed 575 T. rubrum sequences that had not been previously deposited in public databases. Conclusion: In this study, we identified novel T. rubrum genes that will be useful for ORF prediction in genome sequencing and facilitating functional genome analysis. Annotation of these expressed genes revealed metabolic adaptations of T. rubrum to carbon sources, ambient pH shifts, and various antifungal drugs used in medical practice. Furthermore, challenging T. rubrum with cytotoxic drugs and ambient pH shifts extended our understanding of the molecular events possibly involved in the infectious process and resistance to antifungal drugs.

40|$|Members of the Ly- 49 {{gene family}} code for class I MHC-specific receptors that {{regulate}} NK cell function. Due to a combinatorial distribution of Ly- 49 receptors, NK cells display considerable clonal heterogeneity. The acquisition of one Ly- 49 receptor, Ly- 49 A is strictly dependent on <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> trans-acting factor <b>T</b> cell-specific factor- 1 (TCF- 1). Indeed, TCF- 1 binds to two {{sites in the}} Ly- 49 a promoter and regulates its activity, suggesting that the Ly- 49 a gene is a direct TCF- 1 target. TCF- 1 deficiency resulted in the altered usage of additional Ly- 49 receptors. We show in this study, using TCF- 1 beta(2) -microglobulin double-deficient mice, that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly- 49 /MHC class I interactions. Our findings rather suggest a TCF- 1 -dependent, cell autonomous effect on the acquisition of multiple Ly- 49 receptors. Besides reduced receptor usage (Ly- 49 A and D), we also observed no effect (Ly- 49 C) and significantly expanded (Ly- 49 G and I) receptor usage {{in the absence of}} TCF- 1. These effects did not in all cases correlate with the presence of TCF binding sites in the respective proximal promoter. Therefore, besides TCF- 1 binding to the proximal promoter, Ly- 49 acquisition may also be regulated by TCF- 1 binding to more distant cis-acting elements and/or by regulating the expression of additional trans-acting factors. Consistent with the observed differential, positive or negative role of TCF- 1 for Ly- 49 receptor acquisition, reporter gene assays revealed the presence of an inducing as well as a repressing TCF site in certain proximal Ly- 49 promoters. These findings reveal an important role of TCF- 1 for the formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire...|$|R
40|$|Runx family {{transcription}} {{factors are}} essential for embryonic development and have key roles in hematopoiesis. They bind DNA through the conserved Runt domain and can activate or re-press transcription by cooperating with other sequence-specific transcription factors, coactiva-tors, and corepressors (Durst and Hiebert, 2004; Taniuchi and Littman, 2004). Runx 1 (AML 1) and Runx 3 (AML 2) are intimately linked to T cell fate choice and function by regulating tar-get genes that specify CD 4 /CD 8 development in the thymus and the postthymic differentiation of Th 1, Th 2, and Th 17 cells. Runx 1 and Runx 3 sequentially interact with the Cd 4 silencer to block CD 4 expression in double-negative and CD 8 single-positive thymocytes (Taniuchi et al., 2002). Runx 3 facilitates CD 8 T cell lineage choice by repressing Zbtb 7 b, the gene encoding the CD 4 lineage signature transcription factor Th-POK (Egawa and Littman, 2008; Setoguchi et al., 2008) and also {{plays a role in}} mature cyto-toxic T cells (Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009). Runx 1 is predominant in naive CD 4 T cells and tran-siently down-regulated in response to activa-tion. Runx 1 is reexpressed under Th 2 culture conditions (Naoe et al., 2007), whereas Th 1 cells express Runx 3 (Djuretic et al., 2007; Naoe et al., 2007), which cooperates with T-bet to silence Il 4 and activates Ifng expression (Djuretic et al., 2007). Runx 1 promotes Th 17 cell differ-entiation by up-regulating Rorc, the gene en-coding the Th 17 signature transcription factor Ror-t, and II 17 (Zhang et al., 2008). In T reg cells, Runx 1 and the T reg signature transcrip-tion factor Foxp 3 cooperate at the protein level to regulate downstream target genes (Ono et al., 2007), but <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> regulation of <b>T</b> reg cell determinants by Runx proteins remains to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} T 3 X T 7 recombinants were {{isolated}} from crosses between T 3 and T 7 parental phages carrying amber markers in various genes (gene 1 to gene 19). The genetic constitution of these recombinants {{was determined by}} reference to the selected markers and also directly by analysis of the proteins translated from the T 3 X T 7 recombinants in vivo. Although T 3 and TM phages are closely related, most T 3 and T 7 proteins differ slightly in size, and hence the genetic origin of a gene can be determined by protein analysis. The major transcripts read by T 3 and T 7 RNA polymerases from T 3 X T 7 recombinant phage DNAs vary, depending on which regions of the T 3 or T 7 chromosome are present. T 7 RNA polymerase is unable to utilize major promoter sites employed by T 3 polymerase at an appreciable rate, and the converse is also true. Hence <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> pattern for a recombinant phage DNA obtained with the T 3 or T 7 polymerase allows a determination of {{the identity of the}} different promoter sites on <b>the</b> genome. <b>The</b> <b>transcriptional</b> analysis of <b>T</b> 3 X T 7 recombinant DNAs together with earlier observations has been used to map the promoter sites for five out of seven major T 3 and T 7 RNA species on the genetic maps of T 3 and T 7. The promoter sites for the T 7 and T 3 RNA species IIIa, IV, and V originate at the beginning of genes 7, 9, and 10, respectively; the promoter sites for the T 7 and T 3 RNA species I and II are located to the left of gene 11 and gene 13, respectively. No T 3 X T 7 recombinants were found for which the specificity of the phage RNA polymerase was not correlated with the corresponding promoter sites for species IIIa and I (the transcription of which covers 60 % of the genome). That means that the RNA polymerase specified by the recombinant genome is able to read all of the information encoded in sequences read normally from major promoters by the enzyme on the wild-type phage genome. This suggests that the in vitro specificity for promoter site selection by the phage polymerases is also maintained in vivo...|$|R
