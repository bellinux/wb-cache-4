5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach <b>them.</b> <b>Now</b> safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat <b>them</b> <b>now</b> and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against <b>them.</b> <b>Now</b> that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E

25|$|After the American Civil War the Comanche {{were soon}} {{overwhelmed}} {{and the last}} of <b>them,</b> <b>now</b> reduced to about 1,500 people, surrendered to the U.S. army in 1875. Their long-term raiding partners, the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache, also surrendered.|$|E

There is also Chitty Village for the {{minority}} Chitty people which houses the Chitty Museum.|$|E
25|$|Women wore matanpushi, {{embroidered}} headbands, and ninkari, earrings. Ninkari was a metal {{ring with}} a ball. Women wore {{it through a}} hole in the ear. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. However, women wear <b>them</b> <b>now.</b> Furthermore, aprons called maidari now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called tekunkani.|$|E

25|$|From 1842, Eugenia Tadolini was {{primarily}} {{based at the}} Teatro San Carlo in Naples, although she still performed in other Italian theatres and abroad. She sang in the world premieres of at least 12 operas at the Teatro San Carlo, most of <b>them</b> <b>now</b> forgotten, apart from Verdi's Alzira and Donizetti's Poliuto. During that time, she also formed {{a relationship with a}} Neapolitan nobleman by whom she had two children, both of whom died in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{industries in}} Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial {{history is the}} number of abandoned factories, many of <b>them</b> <b>now</b> being used for condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. The state's nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of nuclear submarine construction.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of Shad Thames are the walkways which criss-cross the street high overhead. Most of <b>them</b> <b>now</b> connect the Butlers Wharf building and the Cardamom Building, and were originally used as bridges to roll barrels and the like between warehouses. They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that at the peak of warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E

Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Portions of Mills Park, Crestmoor, and Rollingwood {{are very}} hilly, {{featuring}} canyons and ravines.

Just west of Skyline Boulevard and outside of city limits is San Andreas Lake, which got {{its name from the}} San Andreas Fault. The lake is one of several reservoirs used by the San Francisco Water Department, providing water to San Francisco and several communities in San Mateo County, including San Bruno west of I-280.|$|E

Klieg regains consciousness and sneaks down with the cybergun, reviving the Cybermen once again. Klieg expects to control <b>them</b> <b>now</b> that the Controller is dead, but a revived Cyberman strangled Klieg, killing him. Toberman kills the Cyberman by tearing open its breathing apparatus, while the Doctor and Jamie refreeze the others in their cells.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{origins of}} Burmese folk faith and nat worship are not {{definitively}} known. However {{at the time}} King Anawrahta (1044-1077) was ruling, nat worship was rampant. He became frustrated with this widespread worship of nats, and tried to eliminate them. The people continued to worship the nats, and so the king ordered the destruction of all statues and images of nats. Despite this people still worshiped them, by using a coconut as a symbol for <b>them.</b> <b>Now</b> {{in place of a}} typical nat statue, there sat a coconut, which served as an offering to the nat, as well as a symbol for the nat itself.|$|E
25|$|The Goražde Psalter, ten {{copies of}} which are known to exist today, is counted among the better accomplishments of early Serb printers. The book {{contains}} 352 paper leaves in the quarto format, and its original size was probably 225 by 170millimetres. Each of the preserved copies was trimmed at some point, the largest of <b>them</b> <b>now</b> measures 205 by 140millimetres. None of the copies is complete, but only {{the first and the}} last leaf are not present in any of them. A transcription of the last leaf from a copy that belonged to the Krka Monastery was published in a Slavist journal in 1901.|$|E
25|$|Northern Rhodesian settler {{politicians}} were not convinced by the Colonial Office arguments, {{in particular the}} suggestion that, since the British government had previously recognised the BSAC claims, it could not challenge <b>them</b> <b>now</b> {{on the basis of}} a reinterpretation of terms of the 1923 agreement. Settler representatives proposed either that the BSAC mineral rights should be bought out or that punitive levels of tax should be imposed on BSAC royalties. After years of BSAC obstruction, the company was forced to agree in 1950 that it would surrender their mineral rights in 1986 without compensation, and meanwhile give 20% of its royalties to the Northern Rhodesian government.|$|E
