Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E

And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast.

This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
