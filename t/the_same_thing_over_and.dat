500|$|In 1819 Passez {{offered to}} make Balzac his successor, but his {{apprentice}} {{had had enough}} of the Law. He despaired of being [...] "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.|$|E
2500|$|Between them, Homme and Oliveri had {{different}} {{opinions on the}} usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album [...] "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at [...] "how a lot of stations play <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. We don't get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you {{get caught up in the}} creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. Anyway, I'm {{not really a}} metal dude. None of us are. I'm sure if you studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

6000|$|In {{a letter}} written in June, 1867, Lowell says: [...] "There never is such a season, and that shows what a poet God is.

However, {{he did not want to}} do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game.|$|R

50|$|Is there {{anything}} new I {{can say to}} express my love for you? No, sweet boy, there is nothing, but I must say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> again, like prayers to God, {{in order to keep}} eternal love fresh. The agedness of love disappears as it looks back to when it was first created, even though the passage of time would suggest it should by now have died.|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{the press}} conference of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the {{reporting}} done by the “the very first reporter that broke {{the story of the}} comet’s discovery,” the Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck: John spoiled me.

60|$|They hallooed again, {{and called}} their two comrades by their names {{a great many}} times, but no answer: after some time, we could see them, by the little light there was, run about {{wringing}} their hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes they would go and {{sit down in the}} boat to rest themselves, then come ashore, and walk about again, and so <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|R

60|$|The {{upshot of}} it all was that I sought refuge in that last {{expedient}} of weary Englishmen, travel, not as a globe-trotter, but leisurely and with an inquiring mind, learning much but again finding, like the ancient writer whom I have quoted already, {{that there is no}} new thing under the sun; that with certain variations it is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately we did {{not come}} face to face with the redskins, {{therefore}} a detailed story of our march would be dull reading, for it could only be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again until the hour arrived when we entered General Herkimer's camp on the Oriskany, receiving there such a greeting from the commander himself as caused me to believe he really needed us for some important task.|$|E
