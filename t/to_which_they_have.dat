Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, {{has been introduced}} {{around the world as}} a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E

25|$|Some {{invertebrate}} {{species that}} feature (partial) sexual reproduction {{in their native}} range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been introduced. Relying solely on parthenogenetic reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates, and an exclusively female sex distribution allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly, potentially up to twice as fast. Examples include several aphid species and the willow sawfly, Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but parthenogenetic {{where it has been}} introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|Since then, the {{government}} has expropriated other valuable land, mostly the homes of poor and middle-class Equatoguineans.

Officially, these lands are seized for public purposes, but in fact they have ended {{up in the hands of}} members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, who have built homes or businesses on the properties. In 2003, for example, Le Temps (Geneva) reported on a village in which 75 people lived in abject poverty having been uprooted by the regime from their homes, which had been used to construct a methanol factory without compensation or apology. A 2013 Amnesty report stated that over 1,000 families in the country had been forcibly removed from their homes so that {{the government}} could build roads, luxury homes and hotels, and shopping centers. Many of the homes demolished were in perfect shape, with the vast majority of those living there holding land titles.

500|$|While some of {{the larger}} mines {{provided}} separate eating areas for bal maidens, others obliged male and female workers to eat together, a cause of consternation among some observers concerned that exposure to the [...] "coarse joking" [...] and [...] "rude behaviour" [...] of men had a negative effect on the [...] "modesty and delicacy" [...] expected of women. Other contemporary concerns were that heavy protective clothing led them to be unfeminine, that working in the constant view of men caused the bal maidens to have an unhealthy interest in their own appearance and attractiveness, that spending long hours at work meant {{that they did not have}} time to learn the skills to be good housewives. [...] (Barham's 1841 investigations found no evidence to the claim that bal maidens grew up to be poor housewives, concluding that [...] "they are for the most part tender mothers and industrious wives [...] the laborious occupations <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been inured make household duties appear comparatively light".) Other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved, and often devoutly religious, but it is well-documented that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing. Many contemporary observers commented on the high fashion of the clothing worn by bal maidens on Sundays and holidays; although the disposable income of a bal maiden was low, they would sometimes form [...] "dress clubs" [...] to buy fashionable clothing which they would take turns wearing.|$|E
