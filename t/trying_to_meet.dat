After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E

25|$|A dilemma {{arises from}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> {{important}} planning objectives {{when using the}} grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes, Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.|$|E

500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life seems to me like a dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities." ...|$|E

These principles are significant {{to the history of}} spiritual side of yoga. These may reflect the ancient roots of [...] "undisturbed calmness" [...] and [...] "mindfulness through balance" [...] in later works of Hindu Patanjali and Buddhist Buddhaghosa respectively, states Charles Rockwell Lanman; as well as the principle of Aparigraha (non-possessiveness, non-craving, simple living) and asceticism discussed in later Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E

An alternative to these are [...] "Special Games", which involve the player <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> a tennis-related objective on a Gimmick court. These Special Games come in multiple forms, incorporating themes from past Nintendo games, such as [...] "Tic-Tac-Glow", which requires the player to hit balls of water to liberate Shine Sprites trapped in dirt, a reference to Super Mario Sunshine. Power Tennis supports the option for four-player multiplayer, which can be accessed during [...] "Exhibition Mode", the standard mode of play where the player can choose his or her opponents and the conditions of the match. Such options include the difficulty of the opponent, the court used, and the number of games and sets required to win the match.|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Due to OutKast's newfound {{commercial}} success and higher {{budget for the}} album, the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and [...] "could really just live" [...] at the studio. The duo and studio musicians {{lived and worked in}} the studio for weeks straight, with Big Boi noting, [...] "It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because we take our time; we ain't giving you that fast food, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> a deadline. It ain't done until it's done sonically." [...] For Aquemini, the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation, bringing a baby grand piano into the studio and hiring musicians who played [...] "everything from stoner funk to prog rock". Producer Neal H. Pogue recalled, [...] "That was the beauty of making all those records – having musicians come in and out. It was almost like a Motown, that's what we had. Or like a Stax Records thing. That's what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic." [...] Much of the music on Aquemini was formulated during jam sessions, in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence. While recording Aquemini, André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions. After the musical aspects of a song were developed, André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song.|$|E

George Michael nurses a forbidden crush on his cousin Maeby, while continually <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> his father's expectations. Lindsay's husband Tobias searches for work as an actor, with the aid of Carl Weathers. Michael falls in love with his screw-up older brother Gob's neglected girlfriend Marta, and is torn between being with her and putting [...] "family first".

Through an escalating series of dares, Gob gets married to a woman he just met, played by Will Arnett's real-life then-wife Amy Poehler, but cannot get an annulment because he refuses to admit that he did not consummate the marriage. Kitty, George Sr.'s former assistant and mistress, tries to blackmail the company. She is caught in the Bluth family yacht's explosion, as used in one of Gob's magic acts, but survives with a cooler full of damning evidence labeled [...] "H Maddas". After previous failed attempts, and a brief religious stint in Judaism, George Sr. finally escapes from prison by faking a heart attack.

500|$|The 4th Australian Division {{continued}} {{the attack on}} the II Anzac Corps front, the right hand brigade reaching the assembly areas by [...] before learning of the postponement. The brigade had to lie on open ground under German artillery and machine-gun fire, which caused considerable loss but the left brigade was informed in time to hold back until [...] The bombardment began to creep down the slope at [...] at a rate of [...] in three minutes. The right brigade advanced on a [...] front towards the Oosttaverne line, from the river Douve north to the Blauwepoortbeek (Blue Gate Brook). German machine-gunners in the pillboxes of the Oosttaverne line caused many casualties but with support from three tanks the Australians reached the pillboxes, except for those {{to the north of the}} Messines–Warneton road. As the Australians outflanked the strongpoints, the Germans tried to retreat through the British barrage, which had stopped moving [...] beyond the rear trench of the Oosttaverne line. The left brigade was stopped on its right flank by fire from the German pillboxes north of the Messines–Warneton road up to the Blauwepoortbeek, [...] short of the Oosttaverne line, with many casualties. The left battalion, unaware that the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) to the north had been delayed, veered towards the north-east to try to make contact near Lumm Farm, which took the battalion across the Wambeke Spur instead of straight down. The objective was easily reached but at the Wambeek, [...] north of the intended position. The Australians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the 33rd Brigade, which arrived at [...] with four tanks.

500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E
