5|$|Stela 63 was {{dedicated}} by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts {{and it is}} possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 {{season as}} usual. The {{illuminated}} tableaux {{had been removed}} during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the trains rather than being self illuminated. The line {{was not included in}} the 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism, and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway.|$|E
5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a ship {{so as to}} make its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E

5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin and serve as nucleation sites for new actin filaments. The complex binds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> existing ("mother") filaments and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of}} this nucleation of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the main airway.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the fighter, the {{error in the}} horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side}} of the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E

5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The snout of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, strap-like, side osteoderms of the snout, completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided {{the inside of the}} snout into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils).|$|E
5|$|Traits of O.hammondi that {{supported}} the latter placement include: a relatively short palate that does not extend behind the maxillary bones; simple posterolateral palatal pits; absence of a capsular process (a raising of the bone of the mandible, or lower jaw, at {{the back end of}} the incisor); and presence of the posteroloph on the upper third molar (a crest {{at the back of the}} tooth). In these characters, O.hammondi differs from many or most Oryzomyini and is similar to some species outside Oryzomyini, but all traits of O.hammondi are present in at least one other member of the tribe. Traits shared by O.hammondi and Oecomys included: tail with the same coloration above and below (unicolored); parietal bones extending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the skull; narrow zygomatic plate, without a zygomatic notch; posteroloph present on upper third molar; mesoflexus (a valley in the molar crown in front of the mesoloph crest) on upper second molar not divided in two.|$|E

Ground was broken at Vernon Boulevard and 44th Drive in Long Island City on April 2, 1927. The first contract for work entirely within Queens {{was given to}} the Atwell-Gustin-Morris Company by the New York City Board of Transportation on December 14, 1927. The contract covered the section of the line under Jackson Avenue between the junction with the under-construction Crosstown Line near Queen Street and 44th Drive. The section between Arch Street and Steinway Avenue was awarded to the W.G.T. Construction Company, which required moving the support pillars for the elevated IRT Flushing Line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the street. Triest Construction Company was awarded the next segment, which was between Queen Street and the intersection of Northern Boulevard and 37th Street. The following section was awarded to J.F. Cogan Company, which was required to build the section between the intersection of Steinway Street and Broadway and the intersection of 53rd Street and Northern Boulevard. The remainder of the line was called Route 108, and it was divided into six sections. The first section, between 53rd Street and Pettit Place via Broadway went to Atwell-Gustin-Morris Company, while the section between along Broadway and Queens Boulevard from Pettit Place and 55th Avenue went to George H. Flynn Company. The sections between 55th Avenue and 64th Road and from 64th Road to 71st Road went to Arthur A. Johnson.
