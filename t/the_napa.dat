5|$|In March 2010, {{the port}} {{authorities}} of Trieste, Ravenna, Venice and Koper established the North Adriatic Ports Association (NAPA) in Trieste {{with the aim}} of enhancing the position of the ports in the European Union and its transport patterns. The Port of Rijeka joined <b>the</b> <b>NAPA</b> in November 2010. <b>The</b> <b>NAPA</b> aims to harmonize information systems and organizational setup of the member ports in order to attract shipping. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2013. Besides <b>the</b> <b>NAPA,</b> the Port of Rijeka {{is also a member of}} the EcoPorts network of the European Sea Ports Organisation, the International Harbour Masters' Association, Association Internationale Villes et Ports, the Croatian Association of Port Authorities and the International Association of Ports and Harbors.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Napa</b> Valley AVA {{is known}} {{primarily}} for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, Napa also produces Zinfandel wines described as plummy and intense, tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla.

5|$|The city of Napa has {{historically}} not received as many wine country tourists as the cities north of it. A $300 million flood management project {{around the turn}} of the 21st century to widen <b>the</b> <b>Napa</b> River and raise bridges prompted building developments. In the early 2000s, a large development was completed in the downtown area, as well as several hotels. Copia and the nearby Oxbow Public Market were two large developments also constructed around that time to increase tourist and media focus on the city of Napa.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a complex}} network of watersheds, marshes, rivers, creeks, reservoirs, and bays that {{predominantly}} drain into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The largest bodies of water in the Bay Area are the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries. Major rivers of the North Bay include <b>the</b> <b>Napa</b> River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, the Guadalupe River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso. There are also several lakes present in the Bay Area, including man-made lakes like Lake Berryessa and natural albeit heavily modified lakes like Lake Merritt.|$|E
5|$|After Copia's closure, the {{building}} had been used for a few meetings and events, including <b>the</b> <b>Napa</b> Valley Film Festival and BottleRock Napa Valley. Triad Development arranged to buy the entire site in 2015 and planned mixed use with housing and retail. The company planned to build up to 187 housing units, 30,000 square feet of retail space, and underground parking for 500 cars. The plan had later altered to only include purchase of the southern portion of the property. In 2015, the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) put in motion plans to acquire a separate portion of Copia. The college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The school, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, acquired the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million in October 2015 (it was assessed for $21.3 million around 2013). Among the CIA's first events there was 2016's Flavor! Napa Valley, a food and wine festival sponsored by local organizations. The campus opened in late 2016, with its Chuck Williams Culinary Arts Museum opening in 2017. The museum will house about 4,000 items of Chuck Williams, including cookbooks, cookware, and appliances.|$|E

5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within <b>the</b> <b>Napa</b> County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
