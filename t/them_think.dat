They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped on by a seemingly massive hardhat diver {{they believe to be}} a Cyclops. The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes <b>them</b> <b>think</b> about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E
5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make <b>them</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jalisco {{authorities}} {{believe that}} the attack was planned {{by members of the}} CJNG who were experts in military tactics, ambush and counter-ambush training, and guerrilla warfare. Sophisticated attacks like the ones seen in San Sebastián del Oeste had not occurred before in Jalisco during the Mexican Drug War. The attack showcased the CJNG's manpower, discipline in combat, and ability to coordinate complex attacks without experiencing any casualties. In addition, they stated that those who planned the attack were experts in explosives, which made <b>them</b> <b>think</b> that the CJNG had members with former military or police training with experience in such combat. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco told the press that investigators had evidence that the CJNG was recruiting foreign paramilitary gunmen as foot soldiers in Jalisco. They also had evidence that the CJNG was innovating its arsenal and making its own versions of the AR-15 and M16 assault rifles.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{variation in}} ant–aphid relationships involves lycaenid butterflies and Myrmica ants. For example, Niphanda fusca butterflies lay eggs on plants where ants tend herds of aphids. The eggs hatch as caterpillars which {{feed on the}} aphids. The ants do not defend the aphids from the caterpillars (this {{is due to the}} caterpillar producing a pheromone the ants detect making <b>them</b> <b>think</b> the caterpillar is actually one of them), but carry the caterpillars to their nest. In the nest, the ants feed the caterpillars, who in return produce honeydew for the ants. When the caterpillars reach full size, they crawl to the colony entrance and form cocoons. After two weeks, butterflies emerge and take flight. At this point, the ants will attack the butterfly but the butterfly has a sticky wool like substance on their wings that disable the ants jaws, meaning it can take flight without being ripped apart by the ants.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making <b>them</b> <b>think</b> they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E

500|$|After portraying Adam Carter {{for four}} years, Rupert Penry-Jones felt his {{character}} had {{run its course}} over the series and wanted to explore other venues, stating he was [...] "getting {{to the point where}} I needed to move on." [...] In December 2007, before the sixth series finale was shown, Penry-Jones announced he would leave the series sometime during its seventh year, and revealed the character would leave in what he believed to be [...] "one of the best" [...] Spooks exits. To keep the series in general fresh, the producers wanted to tease the audience into thinking whether or not Adam would escape his fate in time, and even after he is killed, wanted to surprise them and make <b>them</b> <b>think</b> [...] "Oh my God, I can't believe they just did that." [...] Penry-Jones found that his last days on Spooks was generally upsetting and [...] "welled up" [...] on his final day.|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make <b>them</b> <b>think</b> about what they can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E
500|$|According to the directors, [...] " [...] patronizing quality" [...] {{was vital}} to Scar's {{role in the}} film. Minkoff told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "When Scar puts the guilt trip on Simba, that's an intense idea... {{probably}} {{something that is not}} typical of the other Disney pictures, {{in terms of what the}} villain does." [...] Additionally, Scar serves as a departure from previous Disney villains because they [...] "came off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister". Because Scar is the film's main antagonist, supervising animator Andreas Deja believed that [...] "villains work really well when they're subtle", explaining, [...] "to see <b>them</b> <b>think</b> and scheme and plot is much more interesting than showing them beating somebody up." [...] By blaming Mufasa's death on an innocent Simba, Scar ultimately triggers [...] "a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age." [...] The character's first line in The Lion King essentially summarizes the entire film, providing foreshadowing. It reads, [...] "Life's not fair is it? You see I-well, I... shall never be King. And you... shall never see light of another day," [...] subtly revealing the plot as well as [...] "the reason why [...] decides to murder his own brother." ...|$|E

500|$|Part of the game's {{concept is}} {{a balance between}} puzzle-solving and perception, giving the player the freedom to explore The Witnesss world and {{creating}} a non-linear approach to gameplay. Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved [...] "clues in objects that populate the world", which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles. This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving, which [...] "made a lot of sense" [...] to Blow. Blow created the island as open world, so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones, as to avoid punishing the player {{for not being able}} to solve a key puzzle, a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow. Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings, an approach he had taken with Braid. Exploration is encouraged through the game's narrative, which are told by audio logs the player can find on the unpopulated island; through these, Blow attempted to create a [...] "feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space" [...] for the player. Because these logs can be found in any order, Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game. Initially, these audio logs were to be more story-driven, but Blow opted later to change these out for more obfuscated and obtuse information, similar to the text elements used in Braid, as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let <b>them</b> <b>think</b> about what the narrative means instead. Blow's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the clear}} {{implications}} of Thackeray's illustration on the topic, John Sutherland has argued against Becky having murdered Jos {{on the basis}} of Thackeray's criticism of the [...] "Newgate novels" [...] of Edward Bulwer-Lytton and other authors of Victorian crime fiction.
