She told television critic Rob Salem, [...] "It wasn't a constant barrage of harassment.

500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and in my time , <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher Lee C. Rice called Homosexualities [...] "a monumentally {{important}} study" [...] whose authors {{put to rest}} [...] "many psychological {{myths about}} the gay personality" [...] and make [...] "many tentative suggestions for the development and sharpening of new concepts to deal with human sexuality". The gay rights activist Dennis Altman found the book to be a typical example of how research into homosexuality is justified in terms of legitimizing the homosexual life style. Altman noted that Bell and Weinberg's finding that homosexuality is not necessarily related to pathology did not call into question either the concept of pathology or the ability of psychologists to determine it. He suggested that like many other studies of homosexuality, the book appealed to [...] "people who need to combat <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been stigmatized by one set of experts with the reassurances of another." [...] Altman also found its authors to be [...] "heavily influenced by conventional assumptions about relationships and happiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lucas made {{a further}} {{suggestion}} {{that there would}} be a fifth film, revealing an idea [...] "to make Shia LaBeouf the lead character next time and have Harrison Ford come back like Sean Connery did in the last movie." [...] At the time Last Crusade was filmed, Connery was still only 58. Lucas also said that age need not be a factor, as Ford was [...] "65 and did everything in this movie. The old chemistry is there, and it's not like he's an old man. He's incredibly agile; he looks even better than he did 20 years ago, if you ask me." [...] In August 2008, Lucas was researching potential plot devices, and stated Spielberg was open to the idea of the fifth film. He also changed his mind about continuing the series with a spin-off, joking [...] "Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones. If it was Mutt Williams it would be Mutt Williams and the Search for Elvis or something." [...] Two months later, Ford stated that he would not return if the fifth film was an animated film like , because [...] "I'd hate to see it reduced in any way from the movies that we have done and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done them." [...] He also called Lucas' concept for the fifth film [...] "crazy but great".|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, I think if you look at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E
