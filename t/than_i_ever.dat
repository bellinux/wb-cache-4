(Henry was a contract bridge expert and former husband of Kitty Munson Cooper.) He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1941. Writing to Sommerfeld in 1947, Bethe confided that [...] "I am much more at home in America <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was in Germany. As if I was born in Germany only by mistake, and only came to my true homeland at 28." ...|$|E
500|$|The French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 and Adams began to {{struggle}} {{with the issue of}} a young man's responsibility in the conflict; contemporaries of his social position were largely spectators, while those who were less solvent joined the battle as a means to make some money. Adams later said, [...] "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did to be a Lawyer." [...] He was acutely aware that he was the first in his family that [...] "degenerated from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia." ...|$|E

500|$|Reid named Donovan McNabb the Eagles' starter for the 2010 season, but McNabb {{was traded}} to the Washington Redskins and Kevin Kolb was named the starter. While relegated to a second-string role, Vick said he knew he could still play at a high level. Asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract, he said, [...] "I hope so...I feel like I'm {{probably}} better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was in my career, as far as the mental aspect of the game." [...] The Eagles exercised his option for 2010 in March and Vick received a $1.5 million roster bonus.|$|E
500|$|Garfield and his {{supporters}} knew they would face a difficult election {{without the support of}} the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination. [...] Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield's supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did. [...] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. [...] According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of attaining." [...] Conkling eventually relented, and campaigned for the ticket.|$|E
500|$|TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review, {{calling it}} [...] "sassy" [...] but [...] "would work better {{for an artist}} {{at least a decade}} younger than Aguilera", with its [...] "painfully {{adolescent}} lyrics". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "It's one of those pandering songs that will no doubt have young girls singing along, particularly the chorus, but it's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse named it a [...] "filler, including the noisy, childish chant." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "it's the kind of trite glitter-disco might've dispensed", while comparing it to Spice Girls' songs. Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review, writing, [...] "Considering 'I Hate Boys' is closer <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought Christina would ever come to recording a Daphne Aguilera track, it's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor-made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir's forthcoming reality show." ...|$|E

500|$|Garfield and the Ohio {{delegation}} desired a New York Stalwart as Garfield's {{vice presidential}} running mate, partly to placate Conkling, and partly {{to balance the}} ticket geographically. [...] Levi P. Morton declined after consulting with Conkling, who was still unhappy over Grant's loss and advised Morton not to accept. [...] The nomination was then offered to Chester A. Arthur, who had close Stalwart ties to Conkling, but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker the compromise on {{the selection of a}} convention chairman. Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting, but Arthur insisted that he would, calling the Vice Presidency [...] "a greater honor <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of attaining." [...] Arthur won the nomination after he received 468 votes, next to the 193 for Elihu Washburne, and 44 for the third major candidate, Marshall Jewell. Former Governor Edmund J. Davis of Texas and several others were also nominated, but received little support. After convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel at 7:25 P.M. on June 8, the longest ever Republican National Convention was adjourned.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} the Foo Fighters' first instrumental, [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners". [...] It {{was written by}} Grohl after meeting {{with one of the}} miners involved in the Beaconsfield mine collapse who requested an iPod with In Your Honor in it during the incident. As Grohl was moved by this action, he decided to [...] "write something just to dedicate to him that night because he definitely seemed like a hero", and later promised to include the instrumental on the album. The album version features Kaki King, whom Grohl invited to record the song as she was visiting Studio 606. Grohl later said that [...] "I showed it to her once, and she shredded 10 times better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> played it". Another guest was guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998, and a guest musician on the tour for In Your Honor. Smear, who has since been reinstated as a full-on member, described his participation as [...] "the oddest recording experience I had with Foo Fighters" [...] given he had no input in composition and was [...] "going in and playing on a song that was already written".|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Hoyos was the art {{director}} for Phantasmagoria, and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy {{were among the}} computer artists. It was the first computer game Prugh worked on. Mark Hood, a veteran Sierra programmer, and Mark Seibert served as Phantasmagoria project managers. Seibert called managing the project [...] "much more of a technical and managerial problem-solving job <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> envisioned". Unlike previous Sierra games, it also involved managing {{a great deal of}} outside resources, such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule. The game's three-dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics software. In creating the look of the game, Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of Tim Burton, and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting, sets and [...] "imaginative edge" [...] of Batman (1989). Other influences included the films Alien (1979) and Hellraiser (1987). Phantasmagoria was designed using the 3-D software package Alias. Hoyos started by designing the rooms, then created the furniture, and added textures and lighting. Once complete, the computer rendered final images of each room, which became the backgrounds for the game. While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures, Phantasmagoria had more than 1,000.|$|E
500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought possible before".|$|E
500|$|Drury {{commanded}} Neptune for {{the next}} two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took it into her head that morning to sail better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> remember to have seen her do before.' Neptune [...] went into the battle 18 men short of her complement.|$|E
