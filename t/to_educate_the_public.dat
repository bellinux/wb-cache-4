5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E

5|$|Weaver and {{his wife}} moved their {{household}} in 1890 from Bloomfield to Colfax, near Des Moines, as the former Congressman took up more active management of the Iowa Tribune. The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in Des Moines where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; many farmers and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since the Long Depression began in 1873. Many farmers had joined the Farmers' Alliance, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.|$|E
