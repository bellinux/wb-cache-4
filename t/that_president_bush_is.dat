Kerry explained his vote authorizing force by claiming that he believed the Senate resolution was intended to be a diplomatic [...] "threat" [...] to Saddam Hussein and not a blank check for war. In the first of the 2004 U.S. presidential election debates, Kerry argued that Saddam Hussein had posed a significant potential threat, but <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> premature in going to war.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the rhetorical efforts of <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> in {{defending}} his administration's warrantless wiretapping program. Specifically, the study attempts to determine the president's underlying motives when he defended the National Security Agency in a December 2005 radio address by applying Kenneth Burke's dramatistic method of pentadic analysis. Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the president authorized the NSA to intercept communication between people inside the United States and suspected terrorists abroad without a court order, despite a 1978 law making warrantless wiretapping of U. S. persons a felony. The study includes a brief history of wiretapping in the United States and security policies adopted by the country both before and after the president's speech. In applying Burke's pentad, the study reveals <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> efforts <b>were</b> intended to shift criticism onto other agents and to argue that legal barriers to presidential power are dangerous luxuries in a time of war. The study concludes <b>that</b> the <b>president's</b> aims, as revealed through rhetorical criticism, pose a threat to long-standing democratic norms such as the rule of law...|$|R
