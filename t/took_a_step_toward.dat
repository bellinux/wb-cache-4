5|$|In 1955 Pei's group <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> {{institutional}} {{independence from}} Webb and Knapp {{by establishing a}} new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom {{to work with other}} companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
25|$|The state {{legislature}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> rectifying {{the situation in}} 1947. The legislature enacted a statute which gave the state engineer the authority to adjudicate water rights and settle disputes. However, {{there is no evidence}} that this discretion was ever exercised. A second step was taken in 1961 when the legislature passed the state's first water rights act, and barred any new use right claims after January 1, 1962.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} year, Richelieu's {{position}} was seriously threatened by his former patron, Marie de Médicis. Marie {{believed that the}} Cardinal had robbed her of her political influence; thus, she demanded that her son dismiss the chief minister. Louis XIII was not, at first, averse to such a course of action, as he personally disliked Richelieu. Despite this, the persuasive statesman was able to secure the king as an ally against his own mother. On 11 November 1630, Marie de Médicis and the King's brother, Gaston, duc d'Orléans, secured the King's agreement for the dismissal. Richelieu, however, {{was aware of the}} plan, and quickly convinced the King to repent. This day, known as the Day of the Dupes, was the only one on which Louis XIII <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> dismissing his minister. Thereafter, the King was unwavering in his political support for him.|$|E
