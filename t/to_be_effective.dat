5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which have been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> against recurrent disease.|$|E
50|$|Early {{clinical}} trials {{showed that a}} once-a-day dosage <b>was</b> <b>effective.</b> It <b>was</b> subsequently clinically shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equally <b>effective</b> as artemether/lumefantrine, although it <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>effective</b> in the field due to its simpler once-a-day dosage compared to artemether/lumefantrine twice-per-day dosage.|$|R
30|$|Among of the 16 {{analyzed}} medicinal plants, A. orientale <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both highly <b>effective</b> {{as well as}} no toxicity. Five species including C. chinensis, M. alba, F. dibotrys, H. henryi and F. nilgerrensis <b>were</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>effective</b> but toxic. One species, V. odoratissimum, <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>effective</b> {{but only}} at toxic concentrations. S. chinensis <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moderately <b>effective.</b> Three species, P. lobata, T. kirilowii, L. yunnanensis, <b>were</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moderately <b>effective</b> with low toxicity. The remaining five of the 16 test extracts from A. membranaceus, S. ningpoensis, C. chinensis, P. verticillatum, Agrimonia pilosa <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ineffective as anti-insulin resistance agents in DXMS-induced IR HepG 2 cells.|$|R
50|$|Tetracyclines {{have been}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment for BLS, but recent studies have concluded Rifaximin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>effective</b> {{in the treatment of}} BLS. One study by Di Stefano et al, however, concluded Metronidazole <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>effective</b> than Rifaximin in the treatment of BLS.|$|R

40|$|Performance of {{numerous}} corrosion inhibitors was reported and discussed. Various amine corrosion inhibitors were synthesized and tested, and they proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>effective</b> than sulfonates or nitrated products. Various ammonium salts of acid, oil-soluble products were synthesized and {{tested by the}} authors, some of them proving <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>effective.</b> Various combined additives, produced by mixing acid sulfo and nitro products, turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most <b>effective</b> corrosion inhibitors and are widely used at present...|$|R

5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces {{were the first}} to attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There was too much tree cover for the British volleys <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines have been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> {{in a number of different}} animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E

30|$|The {{protocol}} showed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>effective</b> for {{the ants}} that most frequently nested {{in the hospital}} buildings (Nylanderia and Brachymyrmex). Combining two different toxicants –boric acid and borax- has proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particularly <b>effective,</b> since in all cases tested, each species visited one toxicant {{more than the other}} (data not shown).|$|R
40|$|Difloxacin (A- 56619) and A- 56620, two novel fluoroquinolones, {{were tested}} in {{comparison}} with ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and combined clindamycin and gentamicin {{in the treatment of}} experimentally induced intraabdominal abscess associated with Bacteroides fragilis. Difloxacin <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as <b>effective</b> as clindamycin-gentamicin. A- 56620, despite achieving subtherapeutic levels in serum, <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as <b>effective</b> as cefoxitin. Both difloxacin and A- 56620 <b>were</b> <b>effective</b> in vivo against experimentally induced intra-abdominal abscess in rats...|$|R

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E

5|$|Pendle {{was part}} of the parish of Whalley, an area {{covering}} , too large <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> in preaching and teaching the doctrines of the Church of England: both the survival of Catholicism and the upsurge of witchcraft in Lancashire have been attributed to its over-stretched parochial structure. Until its dissolution, the spiritual needs of the people of Pendle and surrounding districts had been served by nearby Whalley Abbey, but its closure in 1537 left a moral vacuum.|$|E
5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion {{channels}} in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins {{do not have a}} resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
