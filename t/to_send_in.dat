5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Metroid: Other M, it was {{reported}} to have a bug where the door in Sector 3 is permanently locked and impassable, preventing players from continuing. Nintendo revealed that a bug is triggered when the player backtracks to the room within Sector 3 where they have previously obtained the Ice Beam. The company has set up a program that allows players affected by the bug <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> an SD card or their Wii console with their save files to be repaired.|$|E

5|$|Artemis {{is finally}} granted the ransom. The gold is sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity— {{she has been}} living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.|$|E
5|$|Auburn's offense {{took over}} at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a {{successful}} drive that took Auburn from {{the shadow of}} its own end zone, completing passes of 16yards, 15yards, and 37yards in the process. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9–0.|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

5|$|Hermes o Logios faced serious {{financial}} problems during this period. When the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 ended, Ignatios {{was forced to}} resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the Philological Society, ceased to exist. In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), Alexandros Vasileiou, a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as well as that the periodical had too few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to canvass for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> their contributions.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 Churchill {{resigned}} {{his commission}} and travelled to South Africa as the correspondent with The Morning Post, on {{a salary of}} £250 a month plus all expenses, {{to report on the}} Second Boer War. He was captured by the Boers in November that year, but managed to escape. He remained in the country and continued <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> his reports to the newspaper. He subsequently published his despatches in two works, London to Ladysmith via Pretoria and Ian Hamilton's March (both 1900). He returned to Britain in 1900 and was elected as the Member of parliament for the Oldham constituency at that year's general election.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{topographical}} officer George W. Hughes {{reported to}} Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights in the zone, allowed the United States <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E

5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a self-proclaimed general named Kilbaba (Mubaba in the Super NES version) seizing control of an unnamed, fictional Gulf state. Installing himself as dictator, Kilbaba quickly begins fortifying his {{position}} with military weapons and installations, including nuclear facilities with which to build bombs. The United States decides <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> a single helicopter, piloted by the player's unnamed character and aided by a co-pilot, to infiltrate and destroy Kilbaba's forces {{in a series of}} swift strikes.|$|E
5|$|To resolve {{prolonged}} deadlocks in papal {{elections in}} the earlier years, local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors, such as first {{in the city of}} Rome in 1241, and possibly before that in Perugia in 1216. In 1269, when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone failed to produce a pope, the city of Viterbo refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> any materials except bread and water. When even this failed to produce a result, the townspeople removed the roof of the Palazzo dei Papi in their attempt to speed up the election.|$|E

5|$|Violent anti-church clashes in Tavastia, central Finland, {{mentioned}} {{in a letter}} by Pope Gregorius IX in 1237, {{have been attributed to}} Thomas' harsh methods of Christianization, but without direct evidence for that conjecture. The letter, addressed to the Archbishop of Uppsala, does not mention the Bishop or Diocese of Finland in any way. Information about the uprising had also originated from the temporarily sidelined Archbishop, who seems to have used the occasion to remind the Pope about Uppsala's earlier contributions to the missionary work in the north. The Pope had clearly not known where Tavastia exactly was, and eloquently urged the Archbishop <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> a crusade.|$|E
5|$|William Hale Thompson was the Mayor of Chicago {{during the}} riot and {{a game of}} brinksmanship with Illinois Governor Frank Lowden may have {{exacerbated}} the riot since Thompson refused to ask Lowden <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> the National Guard for four days, despite Lowden ensuring that the guardsmen were in Chicago and ready to intervene. Although future mayor Richard J. Daley never officially acknowledged {{being part of the}} violence, at age 17 he was {{an active member of the}} Irish Hamburg Athletic Club, which a post-riot investigation named as instigators in attacks on black Americans. In the following decades, Daley continued to rise in politics to become the city's mayor for twenty-one years.|$|E
5|$|After a {{nighttime}} rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works {{of one of}} the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM to sever its relationship with the American Federation of Labor and to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the American labor movement to this day.|$|E

5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at the Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick {{to start}} at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began {{no better than the}} first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of the}} Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>in</b> kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
