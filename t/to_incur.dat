5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1944, the SDS had {{declined}} to a strength of around 24,000–25,000 men. With the return of the Partisans to Serbia proper, the SDS began <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> serious casualties. For example, between 15 March and 15 August 1944, the SDS lost 157 men killed, 107 wounded and 26 missing. By August 1944, SDS units were responding to Mihailović's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|Raghu {{recognises}} Leela and is affectionate to her, which bothers Ramadasu. Despite {{his opposition}} to his father's intentions, Raghu continues to flirt with Manjari and play the prospective bridegroom. Raja and Govindam use a number of disguises {{in an attempt to}} expose Ramadasu's greed. Raghu introduces a foreign woman to Ramadasu as his demanding wife, who forces his father <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> more debt until he is cornered by his creditors. Ramalingam's deception is exposed, and Ramadasu apologises for his misdeeds. Raghu and Leela reconcile; Raja marries Manjari, and Govindam marries Usha.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games. Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National said it was likely <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988, the film received critical acclaim. It was also premiered at the 12th International Film Festival of India. However, it was a commercial failure and Babu had <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> a loss of 0.6 million. It was dubbed as a setback for Chiranjeevi who had starred in a streak of successful films such as Pasivadi Pranam, Swayamkrushi, Jebu Donga (all released in 1987) and Manchi Donga (1988). Babu considered Rudraveena a spiritually awakening film personally and felt that a book could be written about it. The film was remade into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi {{in the same year}} by Balachander himself, with Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role, while Ganesan reprised his role.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|The hall cost NOK134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E
