500|$|Although Berlin {{initially}} wrote [...] "Oh!

[...] More than any other Irving Berlin song, it became the one most associated with Berlin as a performer.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} that inspired Berlin to write [...] "Oh! How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning" [...] was an occasion when a colonel wanted {{a group of}} buglers to play George M. Cohan's [...] "Over There". The buglers were unable to comply because it exceeded the range of their instruments, so the oblivious officer ordered them to practice Cohan's song. He wrote it as [...] "a thin little sergeant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oh! How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Irving Berlin in 1918 that gives a comic {{perspective}} on military life. Berlin composed the song {{as an expression of}} protest against the indignities of Army routine shortly after being drafted into the United States Army in 1918. [...] The song soon made the rounds of camp and became popular with other soldiers, partly because hatred of reveille was universal.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} in soldier revues including 1918's Yip Yip Yaphank, and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, {{as well as in}} 113 Broadway performances of This Is the Army in 1942. Jack Haley sang [...] "Oh! How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning" [...] in the 1938 movie Alexander's Ragtime Band and in 1938 Alice Faye and Ethel Merman also sang the song at [...] the Roxy Theatre in New York City.

500|$|The song {{appeared}} in two shows of 1918: Yip Yip Yaphank and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. Yip Yip Yaphank opened on August 19 and Berlin made his entrance {{late in the}} show, being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended to be asleep on his feet to sing [...] "Oh! How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning". The song was a centerpiece of the show; both it and Berlin's performance received favorable reviews. According to reviewers, Berlin's voice was thin but his timing was perfect and he presented a hilarious stage persona. 24 years later, the New York Times declared Yip [...] "an immediate hit." ...|$|E

[...] As for my voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea.

[...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment I opened my eyes, I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E

While stationed with the 152nd Depot Brigade at Camp Upton, he then composed an all-soldier musical revue titled [...] "Yip Yip Yaphank", written to be patriotic tribute to the United States Army.

2500|$|When the United States joined World War II {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Berlin {{immediately}} began composing a number of patriotic songs. His most notable and valuable contribution {{to the war effort}} was a stage show he wrote called [...] "This is the Army". It was taken to Broadway and then on to Washington, D.C. (where President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended). It was eventually shown at military bases throughout the world, including London, North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and Pacific countries, sometimes in close proximity to battle zones. Berlin wrote nearly three dozen songs for the show which contained a cast of 300 men. He supervised the production and traveled with it, always singing [...] "Oh! How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning". The show kept him away from his family {{for three and a half}} years, during which time he took neither salary nor expenses, and turned over all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} adapted {{into a movie}} {{of the same name}} in 1943, {{directed}} by Michael Curtiz, co-starring Joan Leslie and Ronald Reagan, who was then an army lieutenant. Kate Smith also sang [...] "God Bless America" [...] in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe. The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army, and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the Medal of Merit by President Harry S. Truman. [...] His daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of [...] "This is the Army" [...] on Broadway, remembered that when her father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier's garb to sing [...] "Oh, How I Hate <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning," [...] he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes.

If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust."
