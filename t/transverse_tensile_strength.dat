40|$|INTRODUCTION Matrix ply {{cracking}} is {{a common}} initial damage mechanism in fiber reinforced composites. Because ply cracking alone is seldom catastrophic for laminates subjected to membrane loading, few researchers have tried to identify and overcome the difficulties involved in characterizing the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> associated with matrix ply cracking. However, for composite structures that undergo bending, or other out-of-plane loading, the formation of matrix cracks may lead to immediate catastrophic delamination formation and growth [1, 2]. Hence, accurate characterization of the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of composite materials is needed to accurately predict matrix ply cracking in these structures.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} stresses in beams {{subjected to}} bending {{also set up}} transverse stresses within them; they compress the cross section when the beam's curvature is being increased and stretch it when its curvature is being reduced.

These stresses can qualitatively explain the fracture behaviour of tree branches. Curved ‘hazard beams’ that are being straightened split down the middle because of the low <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of wood. By contrast, straight branches of light wood buckle when they are bent because of its low transverse compressive strength.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} strength of composite laminates {{is sensitive to}} the presence of porosity. Porosity in laminates is generally considered to be a random distribution of voids incurred during the manufacture process. Larger, interlaminar voids typically result from trapped air or moisture; smaller, intralaminar voids may occur between fibers due to improper wetting or the release of volatile gases during the cure cycle. Porosity has its greatest effects on matrix-dominated mechanical properties such as compressive strength, <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). Judd and Wright [1] have surveyed the existing data and made an appraisal of the effects of voids on the mechanical properties of composites. In a study of porosity in filament wound/CVD carbon-carbon composite [2], the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> was found to decrease exponentially with increasing porosity and followed an empirical equation often attributed to Ryshkewitch [3] and Duckworth [4]: σ = σmaxeBP (1) where σmax is the strength at zero porosity, P is the volume fraction of porosity, and B (a negative number) is an empirical constant that depends on pore size, shape, and orientation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{micromechanics}} {{of failure}} {{was developed to}} predict the failure of continuous fiber reinforced composites. A micromechanical approach using unit cells of square and hexagonal arrays was employed to compute the micro stresses of constituents and at the fiber–matrix interface, which {{were used to determine}} the failure initiation of a unidirectional ply. The constituent properties include two <b>tensile</b> and compressive <b>strengths</b> of fiber and matrix, plus normal and shear strengths at the interface. The matrix and interfacial dominated strength properties are determined by matching the micro stresses at the constituent levels with the observed <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> and compressive <b>strengths</b> on the macro ply level. The longitudinal shear failure is then expected to be a result of damage progression after initial failure. Based on the current MMF, in the graphite/epoxy considered in this study both <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> and compressive failure are expected to occur via matrix failure. However, in the glass/epoxy the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> and compressive failures are respectively caused by matrix failure and interfacial tensile failure. These predictions are compared with predictions from other widely used failure criteria as well as experimental data. Lastly, we predicted the failure of laminates. Instead of using a unidirectional ply-based failure theory, starting with the fiber, matrix, and their interface will lead to a much simpler, more generic theory.

40|$|For angleply composites, lamina {{tension and}} {{compression}} strengths are commonly determined by applying classical lamination theory to test {{data obtained from}} testing of angleply composite specimens. For textile composites such as 2 D triaxial braids, analysis is more complex and standard test methods do not always yield reliable strength measurements. This paper describes recent research focused on development of more reliable tensile test methods for braided composites and presents preliminary data for various approaches. The materials investigated in this work have 0 deg+/- 60 2 D triaxial braid architecture with nearly equal fiber volume fraction {{in each of the}} three fiber directions. Flat composite panels are fabricated by resin transfer molding (RTM) using six layers of the braided preform aligned along the 0 deg fiber direction. Various epoxy resins are used as matrix materials. Single layer panels are also fabricated in order to examine local variations in deformation related to the braid architecture. Specimens are cut from these panels in the shape of standard straight-sided coupons, an alternative bowtie geometry, and an alternative notched geometry. Axial tensile properties are measured using specimens loaded along the 0 deg fiber direction. Transverse tensile properties are measured using specimens loaded perpendicular to the 0 deg fibers. Composite tubes are also fabricated by RTM. These tubes are tested by internal pressurization using a soft rubbery material sealed between the inside diameter of the tube and the load fixtures. The ends of the tube are unconstrained, so the primary load is in the hoop direction. Tubes are fabricated with the 0 deg fibers aligned along the tube axis by overbraiding the preform on a mandrel. Since the loading is in the hoop direction, testing of the overbraided tube provides a measure of <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Previous work has indicated that straight-sided coupons yield a <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> that is much lower than the expected material strength because of premature edge-initiated failure. Full-field strain measured during transverse tensile tests clearly showed accumulation of edge damage prior to failure. In the current work, high speed video and testing of single layer specimens are used to investigate potential failure mechanisms in more detail. High speed video clearly shows the edge initiation in six layer transverse tensile test coupons. Specimens with the bowtie geometry and the notched geometry minimize this edge effect and yield significantly higher <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> values compared to the straight-sided coupons. However, bowtie and notched specimens geometries are not ideal because of the non-uniform stress and strain fields in the region of failure. Testing of tubes using internal pressurization eliminates edge-initiated failure and provides a more uniform state of stress and strain. Preliminary results indicate that bowtie, notched, and tube specimens yield comparable values for <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and that these values are much higher than the strength measured using a straight-sided coupon...|$|E

For liquid aluminium to liquid steel interactions obtained by key-hole mode, rather sound and resistant assemblies were realized either on non-galvanized or galvanized steel provided steel was placed upon aluminium with penetration in aluminium limited to 0. 5 mm. The influence of galvanized layer was only detectable on the fusion zone of aluminium where occluded zinc bubbles were observed.

For liquid aluminium to solid steel interactions carried out by defocused laser, 180 N/mm <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were obtained on non-galvanized steels by using a brazing flux.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} aluminium matrix (CF/Al) composites were fabricated with a hybridization technology through {{pressure casting}} and {{characterization of the}} hybrid composites obtained was carried out. Hybridization with SiC additive could improve the infiltration performance of fibre preform, control the fibre volume fraction, and increase the fibre-strength transfer efficiency of the hybrid composites. The longitudinal tensile strength of the hybrid composites was greatly improved {{compared with that of}} the conventional composite. It was found that the strength deterioration of high-modulus cab on fibres (HMCFs) during fabrication was not heavy and depended upon the type of aluminium matrix, while the strength of high-strength carbon fibres (HSCFs) was greatly reduced by aluminium matrix, but the degradation did not depend on the variety of the matrix. As a result, the longitudinal tensile strength of hybrid HMCF/Al composites was higher than 800 MPa, while that of hybrid HSCF/Al composites was about 400 MPa. Contrariwise, the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of hybrid HSCF/Al composites was much greater than that of hybrid HMCF/Al composites.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{excellent}} properties of carbon fibres (CF) and the growing demand for multi-functional materials e. g., electrically conductive composites, engineering thermosets with carbon fibres are highly attractive. Similarly, electrically conductive fillers are of great importance. Engineering thermosets constitute an important group of polymers commonly used as matrices for polymeric matrix composites (PMCs). Requirements for these materials, particularly mechanical properties, fire resistance and high-temperature performance, are steadily increasing. Two thermosets offering particularly advantageous properties are melamine-formaldehyde (MF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF). Composites based on MF and PF are studied here. Novel composites of MF reinforced with carbon fibres and MF with carbonaceous fillers (carbon black and mineral-carbon shungite) were prepared and investigated {{in terms of their}} microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties. A non-vented manufacturing technique resembling film stacking was developed based on MF moulding compounds with cellulose. CF veils were impregnated with a suspension of alumina trihydrate (ATH) in aqueous MF, dried and processed similarly to sheet moulding compounds (SMCs). Also up-scaled production by injection moulding was used to prepare CF/PF composites. Carbon fibres improve stiffness and strength of MF composites compared to glass reinforcement. Interfacial CF/MF adhesion is low judging from the interfacial shear and <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths.</b> Functional grading in the form of flexibilized MF coating applied to dispersed fibres improves both strength and strain at break by providing more favourable conditions during processing and crack propagation. Using softer ZnS pigment replacing hard Ti 0 2 also improves mechanical properties. For injection moulded PF composites, particularly rubber modified grades, post-curing (proprietary) improves stiffness retention and fatigue performance. Short carbon fibre composites (proprietary) show improved stiffness, strength and fatigue performance, but reduced strain at break, as compared to glass reinforcement. During fatigue, these composites show a linearly decreasing cyclic modulus up to failure. This may enable the prediction of fatigue lifetimes from shorter-time tests, given that the final fatigue modulus can be established. However defects such as undispersed fibre bundles introduce significant scatter in fatigue lifetimes, making such predictions difficult. Fibre breakage occurred in both carbon- and glass fibre composites during quasi-static tensile loading and fatigue. Composites of MF/cellulose and carbon black exhibit electrical conductivity and improved stiffness at low average loadings of the filler, this attributed to the concentration of CB along the cellulose fibres. Composites of MF/cellulose and shungite filler exhibit electrical conductivities in the dissipative range. Compared to CB, shungite is easier to handle and water-ethanol instead of pure ethanol may be used during sonication. Mechanical properties are however rather poor, indicating weak shungite/MF interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from torsion tests conducted on 36 multilayered, filament-wound, glass-epoxy tubes. Configurations with helical windings and with alternating helical and circumferential windings were investigated for various winding angles. Under small loadings, shear moduli deduced from linear shear stress-strain curves {{were found to}} be in reasonable agreement with analytical predictions. Under larger loadings, various degrees of nonlinearity in shear stress-strain curves were encountered, depending on the helical winding angle. Experimental torsional strengths were defined by a 0. 2 -percent offset yield stress or by maximum stress when large nonlinearities did not exist. These strengths were compared with torsional buckling predictions for orthotropic cylinders, and with material strength predictions based on orthotropic yield criteria and elastic stress analysis. Computed elastic buckling stresses were considerably higher than the experimental strengths for most of the test specimens except for those with only 30 ° and 45 [degree] windings. Experimental torsional strengths- were found to correlate with conventional yield predictions if predicted yielding in certain layers were ignored or if unrealistically large <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> and shear <b>strengths</b> of unidirectional laminae were employed in the analysis.

40|$|In this paper, {{copper and}} mild steel were welded using a gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW) process. To determine the weldablity factor, tests {{are needed to}} provide information on mechanical strength, potential defects in structure, and nature of failure. Mechanical testing included <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> tests, micro hardness tests, and bend tests. The results for the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> test revealed failure occurred at the copper heat affected zone (HAZ) with an ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of 220 MPa. The weld metal produced the highest average hardness value of 173 HV. The bend tests revealed small cracks on the surfaces of each bend {{and the nature of the}} bend, bent around the copper HAZ. Metallography revealed ferrite (α) and copper (ε) cellular and dendritic shaped microstructure in the weld metal. Post weld heat treatment (PWHT) was attempted to observe if any improvements on strength could be achieved. Tensile and micro hardness tests revealed the copper base metal increased in ductility significantly and in the weld metal slightly increased in ductilit...|$|R
