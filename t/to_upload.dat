Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks <b>to</b> <b>upload</b> debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts.

As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
