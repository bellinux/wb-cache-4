Later in the game, Matt goes through {{different}} cars because of the person that he doesn't know gets them for him (except for a few cars in The Run.) Matt asks her about her identity but she doesn't respond to his question. However, there is a conflict when they get to a certain area. There, Matt finds out that the unknown person was using him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> area.|$|E
500|$|Ndegéocello {{spent over}} a year writing the songs from Devil's Halo, being {{inspired}} in part by her trip to Ireland. [...] "I went {{to a couple of}} pubs and there were much older gentlemen playing the guitar and just singing these amazing, simple songs", Ndegéocello recalled. [...] "I really admired that. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> kind of place where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E

500|$|Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. [...] She would wake {{early in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff was {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. [...] She would average 10–12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou went through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang." [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, in order to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou stated that she played cards in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. [...] She stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! [...] It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol was {{strictly}} forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk {{in turn was}} fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase [...] "round the back for the old brandy!" [...] or [...] "the old Marlon Brando" [...] was used to announce the exit {{of one or more}} characters, or a break for music. In [...] "The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy" [...] (Series 9, Episode 4) Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, [...] "I wonder where he keeps that stuff!". In [...] "The Scarlet Capsule" [...] (Series 9, Episode 14) Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of [...] "Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there" [...] was [...] "The introductions he gives me...". [...] In [...] "The Moon Show" [...] (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating [...] "Man, the excuses he makes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> brandy!", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail [...] "MATE!" [...] in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{you are on}} {{the wrong}} road <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place," [...] said the man.

50|$|Many {{large cities}} link their railway network to their bus network. This enables commuters <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> places <b>that</b> are not {{serviced}} directly by rail {{as they are}} often considered to be too far for walking.|$|R

60|$|I now {{ordered the}} troops {{to be put}} under cover and allowed some of the rest which they had so long needed.

6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] {{said the}} captain, with a {{disappointed}} look. [...] "However, it can't be helped; but I see my way {{now to get}} you out o' this fix. You know, I suppose, that they're buildin' a lighthouse on the Bell Rock just now; well, the workmen go off to it for a month at a time, I believe, if not longer, and don't come ashore, and it's such a dangerous place, and troublesome <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to,</b> <b>that</b> nobody almost ever goes out to it from this place, except those who have to do with it. Now, lad, you'll go down to the workyard the first thing in the mornin', before daylight, and engage to go off to work at the Bell Rock. You'll keep all snug and quiet, and nobody'll be a bit the wiser. You'll be earnin' good wages, and in the meantime I'll set about gettin' things in trim to put you all square." ...|$|E
60|$|We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, {{the capital}} of the vast Province of South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion. On the train we found several Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit, and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver mine is. It seemed a curious road to take <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> region. Broken Hill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is on the eastern border. A fairly {{straight}} line, 700 miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo. The way the Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said; southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide, then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales once more--to Broken Hill. It was like going from Boston southwest to Richmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York.|$|E
60|$|During the tedious {{interval}} of {{waiting on the}} Chunapay I was told a flattering tale by the village Indians, which eventually caused me to abandon the proposed journey to the Rio Negro. These Indians wore necklets, like nearly all the Guayana savages; but one, I observed, possessed a necklet unlike that of the others, which greatly aroused my curiosity. It was made of thirteen gold plates, irregular in form, about as broad as a man's thumb-nail, and linked together with fibres. I was allowed to examine it, and {{had no doubt that}} the pieces were of pure gold, beaten flat by the savages. When questioned about it, they said it was originally obtained from the Indians of Parahuari, and Parahuari, they further said, was a mountainous country west of the Orinoco. Every man and woman in that place, they assured me, had such a necklet. This report inflamed my mind {{to such a degree that}} I could not rest by night or day for dreaming golden dreams, and considering how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> rich district, unknown to civilized men. The Indians gravely shook their heads when I tried to persuade them to take me. They were far enough from the Orinoco, and Parahuari was ten, perhaps fifteen, days' journey further on--a country unknown to them, where they had no relations.|$|E
50|$|Houstonians {{viewed the}} Mavericks largely with indifference. Average {{attendance}} {{was listed as}} 1,543, easily {{the worst in the}} league. It took some effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> even <b>to</b> <b>that</b> low figure; the team was lucky to attract 500 fans on most nights.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{something}} to be said for your marine landscape here, after all," [...] remarked the Sergeant. [...] "Here are a woman's footsteps, Mr. Betteredge! Let us call them Rosanna's footsteps, until we find evidence to the contrary that we can't resist. Very confused footsteps, you will please to observe--purposely confused, I should say. Ah, poor soul, she understands the detective virtues of sand as well as I do! But hasn't she been in rather too great a hurry to tread out the marks thoroughly? I think she has. Here's one footstep going FROM Cobb's Hole; and here is another going back to it. Isn't that the toe of her shoe pointing straight to the water's edge? And don't I see two heel-marks further down the beach, close at the water's edge also? I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I'm afraid Rosanna is sly. It looks as if she had determined <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place you and I have just come from, without leaving any marks on the sand to trace her by. Shall we say that she walked through the water from this point till she got to that ledge of rocks behind us, and came back the same way, and then took to the beach again where those two heel marks are still left? Yes, we'll say that. It seems to fit in with my notion that she had something under her cloak, when she left the cottage. No! not {{something to}} destroy--for, in that case, where would have been the need of all these precautions to prevent my tracing the place at which her walk ended? Something to hide is, I think, the better guess of the two. Perhaps, if we go on to the cottage, we may find out what that something is?" ...|$|E
