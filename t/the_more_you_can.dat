So {{what does this mean}} for health, sustainability, finance, and all the other pressing issues facing us? People care, and it matters that they care, and it is the inherent sociability of people that provides the basis for sustained coordination. Usually we take this for granted or ignore it, but the way we work together is key to making a difference. So – how do we manage things differently to work together better and make a difference? Ideas about social media, management, design and systems thinking will be provided to gain some collective intelligence and ideas about tactics and strategies for change...|$|R
