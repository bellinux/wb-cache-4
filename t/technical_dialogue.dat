40|$|Recognizing {{the need}} for greater {{attention}} worldwide to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, implementers are increasingly putting NCD programs in place. This effort is yielding practice-based experiences and evidence {{that may not be}} systematically documented and shared, reflected in a limited body of peer-reviewed and gray literature and few platforms for knowledge exchange. To draw on such knowledge that is grounded in experience, we gathered information through reviews of literature, local needs assessments, <b>technical</b> <b>dialogues</b> at the national and local levels, and structured global stakeholder engagement events to yield four principles that reflect the current state of knowledge on developing and implementing community-based services for health promotion and disease management: (1) Support and empower people living with chronic disease to provide better self-care and advocate for improved services. (2) Invest in integrating NCDs into existing development platforms but do not underestimate true costs and effort. (3) Engage a broad range of front-line health workers to champion care. (4) Build coalitions to leverage the strengths of both the public sector’s and private sector’s capacity and leadership. If applied consistently by funders and implementers, these principles have the potential to accelerate progress in reaching low-resourced communities with NCD care and treatment services. At the same time, if implementers commit to proactively, transparently, and collaboratively sharing experience-based learning, the NCD movement will not only pick up speed and be well supported by evidence but will also benefit from programmatic, financial, and political synergies at the global, national, and local levels...|$|R

500|$|Fi {{was created}} before the {{implantation}} of Wii MotionPlus, {{when she was}} going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. [...] She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's <b>technical</b> <b>dialogue</b> for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne. The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of [...] and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractModern {{technology}} has changed matters in documentation radically {{and promises to}} continue to bring rapid changes. Photographic and non-photographic (graphic) documentation tools are merging in one process, in which the digital photographic technology is the main base. 3 D supports are still not popular among users involved in documentation of historic sites. Due to the digital technology, actually, there is an increasing gap between the specialized technician and non technician users. However, {{in order to build}} a bridge between the specialized technical and non <b>technical</b> users, a <b>dialogue</b> between them must now be created. They should not only discuss issues of data precision required and 3 D accuracy standards, but simultaneously should discuss issues of achieving visualization production system, which can now be actually easily achieved by the modern digital photographic technology.

It attempts to clarify some new aspects in documentation methods for the non-technical experts and users, and the impact of current technology in its quick development. This will be achieved through a comparative evaluation of the potentials of the application of digital methods in documentation, and in view of the main obtained quality, accuracy, time, costs and specific skills required.

40|$|The {{management}} of used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste {{is required for}} any country using nuclear energy. This includes the storage, transportation, and disposal of low and intermediate level waste (LILW), used nuclear fuel (UNF), and high level waste (HLW). The Used Fuel Disposition Campaign (UFDC), within the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Office of Fuel Cycle Technology (FCT), is responsible for conducting research and development pertaining to the {{management of}} these materials in the U. S. Cooperation and collaboration with other countries would be beneficial to both the U. S. and other countries through information exchange and a broader participation of experts in the field. U. S. participation in international UNF and HLW exchanges leads to safe management of nuclear materials, increased security through global oversight, and {{protection of the environment}} worldwide. Such interactions offer the opportunity to develop consensus on policy, scientific, and <b>technical</b> approaches. <b>Dialogue</b> to address common technical issues helps develop an internationally recognized foundation of sound science, benefiting the U. S. and participating countries. The UNF and HLW management programs in nuclear countries are at different levels of maturity. All countries utilizing nuclear power must store UNF, mostly in wet storage, and HLW for those countries that reprocess UNF. Several countries either utilize or plan to utilize dry storage systems for UNF, perhaps {{for long periods of time}} (several decades). Geologic disposal programs are at various different states, ranging from essentially 'no progress' to selected sites and pending license applications to regulators. The table below summarizes the status of UNF and HLW management programs in several countriesa. Thus, the opportunity exists to collaborate at different levels ranging from providing expertise to those countries 'behind' the U. S. to obtaining access to information and expertise from those countries with more mature programs. The U. S. fuel cycle is a once through fuel cycle involving the direct disposal of UNF, as spent nuclear fuel, in a geologic repository (previously identified at Yucca Mountain, Nevada), following at most a few decades of storage (wet and dry). The geology at Yucca Mountain, unsaturated tuff, is unique among all countries investigating the disposal of UNF and HLW. The decision by the U. S. Department of Energy to no longer pursue the disposal of UNF at Yucca Mountain and possibly utilize very long term storage (approaching 100 years or more) while evaluating future fuel cycle alternatives for managing UNF, presents a different UNF and HLW management R&D portfolio that has been pursued in the U. S. In addition, the research and development activities managed by OCRWM have been transferred to DOE-NE. This requires a reconsideration of how the UFDC will engage in cooperative and collaborative activities with other countries. This report presents the UFDC implementation plan for international activities. The DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) has cooperated and collaborated with other countries in many different 'arenas' including the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and through bilateral agreements with other countries. These international activities benefited OCRWM through the acquisition and exchange of information, database development, and peer reviews by experts from other countries. DOE-NE cooperates and collaborates with other countries in similar 'arenas' with similar objectives and realizing similar benefits. However the DOE-NE focus has not typically been in the area of UNF and HLW management. This report will first summarize these recent cooperative and collaborative activities. The manner that the UFDC will cooperate and collaborate in the future is expected to change as R&D is conducted regarding long-term storage and the potential disposal of UNF and HLW in different geologic environments. While some continuation of on-going or recent cooperative and collaborative activities are expected to continue, the approach taken in these activities may be different than past activities given the changes in the U. S. waste management program. In addition, new cooperative and collaborative activities with different scope than in the past may be undertaken. Such potential future cooperative and collaborative activities will be discussed. The last part of the plan includes the implementation of the UFDC international activities...|$|R
