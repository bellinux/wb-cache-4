5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. <b>This</b> <b>gets</b> the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth, and a family of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Gramicidin S biosynthetic pathway {{consists}} of two-enzyme of nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), gramicidin S synthetase I (GrsA) and gramicidin S synthetase II (GrsB), {{to give a}} product as a cyclic decapeptide. Within the biosynthetic pathway, there are total of five modules that specifically recognize, activate, and condense the amino acids to gramicidin S. Starting module GrsA {{consists of}} three domains: [...] Adenylation (A) domain where it incorporates the amino acid and activates it by adenylation using ATP, Thiolation (T) domain or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) in which the adenylated amino acid gets covalently attached to the 4´-phosphopantetheine group and <b>this</b> <b>gets</b> loaded onto the conserved serine in the T domain, Epimerization (E) domain where it epimerizes L-amino acid to D-amino acid. Starting module GrsA loads D-Phe onto the system.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Johnson got his {{job because}} of another scandal. [...] <b>This</b> <b>gets</b> complicated: former Ohio State Treasurer Joe Deters saw two of his aides indicted. Damaged goods, he left in midterm to run for county {{prosecutor}} back home in Cincinnati. Gov. Taft moved then-Lt. Gov. Jennette Bradley into Mr. Deters' job by appointment, hoping she'll hold the spot for Republicans in 2006. And then the governor appointed his development director, Mr. Johnson, as lieutenant governor. The finagling has simply been rampant. For a man to become governor through that process and a gubernatorial scandal would be, uh, scandalous. Whether a new governor with that background would be even weaker than a convicted Gov. Taft is a close call. The decisive factor in determining who should be governor has to be that Gov. Taft {{was the one who}} was elected.|$|E

Vancouver Police Department chief Jim Chu said that instigators appeared to {{be some of the}} same individuals involved in a protest on the opening day of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and that they came equipped with eye protection, gasoline and other tools. He called them [...] "criminals and anarchists" [...] who disguised themselves as fans. The idea that anarchists were involved in the violence was rejected by UBC political science professor Glen Coulthard, and others in a Vancouver Sun article on June 24. [...] "That <b>this</b> <b>gets</b> tagged as anarchist activity is just more of an assumption or bias that {{has been around for a}} long time," [...] said Coulthard. [...] "narchists are a convenient scapegoat for the police to deflect responsibility for what happened," [...] said another commentator.

2500|$|Several phrases are echoed {{throughout}} the play. In Act I, for example, Fred describes Mrs. Van Brugh as [...] "beloved, honoured, and courted by all" [...] – {{a phrase that}} Mrs. Van Brugh will repeat in her Act II scene with Smailey (as seen in the quote to the right): [...] "Woman—loved, honoured, courted by all. Woman—shunned, loathed, and unutterably despised, but still—Woman", foreshadowing the change in status that she will undergo {{by the end of}} the play. Ruth, in her Act I description of people who claimed to be trying to help her, describes people who have claimed to be trying to help her before: [...] "There's ladies come odd times. I call to mind one—come in a carriage she did. [...] Same story—poor, miserable, lost one—wretched, abandoned, fellow-creetur, and that." [...] <b>This</b> <b>gets</b> echoed in Mr. Smailey's catchphrase, [...] "I have no desire to press hardly on any fellow creature" [...] (also seen in the quote), which becomes more and more ironic in usage as the play goes on, finally being uttered by Fitz-Partington as he informs Mr. Smailey: [...] "I desire to press hardly on no fellow-creature, but your own policeman is without, and he will be happy to walk off with you whenever you find it convenient to be arrested." ...|$|E

The sixth reviewer, Theron Martin, agreed that [...] "formulaic and generic" [...] wouldn't be wrong ways to describe the story and he also praised Stella's underlying motivations. Martin concluded that while the series has potential, it needs to find [...] "fresher angles" [...] to stand out from other similar storylines. Silverman reviewed the anime's future episodes; she called the final episode [...] "a triumphant one in terms of Ikki's battle against his own insecurities, his place at school, and his relationship with Stella", and would later go {{on to say that}} she was [...] "pretty happy with this ending and [...] wouldn't be sad if another season materialized somewhere along the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naomi's best friend, fallen starlet Adrianna Tate-Duncan, battles a drug addiction. <b>This</b> <b>gets</b> {{her into}} trouble when Harry decides to raid the school, {{thanks to the}} help of a cop, Kimberly McIntyre, under cover as a student. Kimberly begins a {{relationship}} with teacher/lacrosse coach Ryan Matthews, which gets him into trouble with the school. Guilt-ridden, Kimberly does her best to solve the case, giving Ryan his job back, although he takes a leave of absence to rethink his life, and Adrianna lands in rehab, after almost getting Naomi in legal troubles as she took the blame for the drugs. There, she begins a relationship with Navid Shirazi, head of the school's paper and Dixon's best friend, who paid for her rehab. Navid and Adrianna are in completely different groups in high school. Adrianna was much more outgoing and popular while Navid was more focused on his studies. Navid's dream was {{to have an opportunity to}} date Adrianna. Although at first she only does it to [...] "repay" [...] him, they start to genuinely care about each other. Adrianna later discovers she is pregnant as a result of her promiscuity while she was addicted. After telling Navid of her pregnancy, he breaks up with her. It is later revealed that the father of Adrianna's child is Ty, although it is unclear when they slept together. She and Navid get back together when he realizes that even though she is a mess he can't get over her, and get engaged, although he alienates his family when he tells them that the child is not his and gets upset when Adrianna reveals her daughter is Ty's. Navid's family is very close knit and is in someways conservative. This is only applies to some areas of life, seeing that his dad runs an adult entertainment business.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 8 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "If Lip Lock isn't mean enough, well, neither is Eve. She's sweeter than before and musically more adventurous. It's just a shame she burned up the title Eve-Olution on that previous release." [...] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin said, [...] "Lip Lock {{may not be the}} best rap album of 2013, but it's interesting, and it's honest. After 11 years, that's a respectable way to ride out." [...] Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX said, [...] "Seeing Eve return is a welcoming sight, and while unexpected, the experimental arrangements of her new project can be written off as just that. The heart of the issue with Lip Lock is that Eve hasn’t restored the command she once had, which subsequently allows these new sounds to lead her down a road of uncertainty. Eve’s maturation as a person has been obtained through time; it may take more before her music catches up." [...] Lauren Martin of Fact stated, [...] "Eve doesn’t dwell on the past with underhand bitterness or glassy-eyed nostalgia. Considering it’s been eleven years, there’s a pointedly absent element of story-telling about her hiatus which leaves the listener wanting more, yet Eve was never held up as a great lyricist and can’t really be bashed for not being one now. That’s not where her appeal lies. For all her success in commercial rap Eve is first and foremost a singer. It’s the fluidity of her appeal that she’s most keenly aware of, and <b>this</b> <b>gets</b> a triumphant finale on the remix of first single ‘She Bad Bad’ featuring Pusha T and Juicy J. As the three fellow comeback success stories stand side by side like this over what is certainly the album’s most intense beat, even I feel smug listening to it. Eve is back, and she barely broke a sweat." ...|$|E
