50|$|All 22 {{individuals}} studied had partial {{or complete}} webbing {{of the soft}} tissue between their fingers and toes. In 13 of the individuals the most lateral 3 or 4 toes were flexed at the interphalangeals joints. According to Dundar and coworkers, 8 of the 22 individuals had “pre axial polydactyly in the hands (unilateral in two, bilateral in six), ranging in severity from broad or bifid distal phalanges in the thumbs to duplication of an entire biphalangeal or triphalangeal thumb, in two cases with an associated extra metacarpal, lying in a soft tissue web between the thumb and index finger. Fourteen had preaxial polydactyly in the feet (unilateral in one, bilateral in 13), consisting of a small extra biphalangeal toe, in most cases with an associated rudimentary extra metatarsal, lying in a soft tissue web between the hallux and second toe. In some cases, this was accompanied by hypoplasia {{of the head of}} the first metatarsal and absence of both phalanges of the hallux. In addition, 14 had a sternal abnormality, consisting of a pectus carinatum deformity of the upper sternum and/or a pectus excavatum deformity of the lower sternum, producing a blind ending, inverted U shaped sinus in the anterior chest wall.

40|$|IntroductionIt {{is often}} not {{possible}} to determine whether small nodules detected on computed tomography (CT) in oncology patients are metastatic. We evaluated a group of oncology patients to determine the outcome of small pulmonary nodules and whether they can be ignored in the therapeutic decision process. Materials and MethodsRadiology reports of <b>thoracic</b> <b>CTs</b> from a 2 -year period were searched for keywords indicating a small pulmonary nodule. All CT images were evaluated by two thoracic radiologists for nodules 4 mm or less. There were 102 cases that met criteria for inclusion. ResultsForty-seven had follow-up CT of less than 365 days, and 55 had follow-up CT for more than 365 days. For those with less than 365 days, the observed nodule was increased (17, 36 %), increased and new nodules (9, 19 %); stable (19, 40 %); stable but new nodules developed (1); and decreased (1). For those with greater than 365 days follow-up, the observed nodule was increased (3, 5 %); stable (51, 93 %); and stable but new nodule developed (1). Combined, 28 % of patient';s nodules increased (90 % were within 365 days; 25 % within 203 days; and 14 % within 14 days). ConclusionIn oncologic patients, 28 % of small pulmonary nodules detected at initial CT will increase in size, suggesting metastasis. This increase in size tends to occur early, and follow-up CT in 3 months and 6 months would be appropriate in further evaluation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary staging in {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) {{has traditionally been}} carried out by means of plain chest radiograph (CXR), although computerised tomography (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being performed for this purpose. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the value of pre-operative <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> for pulmonary staging in CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on all patients referred into hospital over a 20 -month study period for double contrast barium enema evaluation of symptoms suggestive of an underlying CRC. Patients with a CRC went on to have a staging intravenous, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis prior to an out-patient appointment with a colorectal surgeon. The CXRs of those patients in whom a radiological abnormality was seen on <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> were reviewed blindly by an independent consultant radiologist. RESULTS: A total of 403 barium enemas were performed, of which 38 demonstrated a CRC (9 %). In those patients diagnosed with CRC, nine (24 %) had an abnormality on <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT.</b> Four patients with positive thoracic CTs had chemotherapy and or radiotherapy with no surgery. One patient underwent colectomy, and 2 patients who had primary lung tumours as opposed to metastases also underwent colectomies. One patient received palliative care only. In addition, one of the patients underwent multiple, non-diagnostic thoracic investigations prior to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis being made and then proceeding to surgery. An independent consultant radiologist reviewed seven out of the nine CXRs of patients with an abnormality on <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis, and reported three of the CXRs to be normal. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> appears to improve the accuracy of pulmonary staging in CRC allowing a more appropriate level of intervention. However, CT is likely to identify more benign radiological abnormalities than CXR alone, and investigations should not occur to the detriment of treating the primary tumour...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{trends in}} the utilization of head, abdominal, thoracic and other body regions CTs {{in the management of}} victims of MVC at a level I trauma center from 1996 to 2006. ^ Method. From the trauma registry, I identified patients involved in MVC 2 ̆ 7 s in a level I trauma center and categorized them into three age groups of 13 - 18, 19 - 55 and ≥ 56. I used International Classification of Disease (ICD- 9 -CM) codes to find the type and number of CTs examinations performed for each patient. I plotted the mean number of CTs per patient against year of admission to find the crude estimate of change in utilization pattern for each type of CT. I used logistic regression to assess whether repetitive CTs (≥ 2) for head, abdomen, thorax and other body regions were associated with age group and year of admission for MVC patients. I adjusted the estimates for gender, ethnicity, insurance status, mechanism and severity of injury, intensive care unit admission status, patient disposition (dead or alive) and year of admission. ^ Results. Utilization of head, abdominal, thoracic and other body regions CTs significantly increased over 11 -year period. Utilization of head CT was greatest in the 13 - 18 age group, and increased from 0. 58 CT/patient in 1996 to 1. 37 CT/patient in 2006. Abdominal CTs were more common in the ≥ 56 + age group, and increased from 0. 33 CT/patient in 1996 to 0. 72 CT/patient in 2006. Utilization of <b>thoracic</b> <b>CTs</b> was higher in the 56 + age group, and increased from 0. 01 CT/patient in 1996 to 0. 42 CT/patient in 2006.

40|$|Quantitative {{evaluation}} of image registration algorithms {{is a difficult}} and under-addressed issue {{due to the lack}} of a reference standard in most registration problems. In this work a method is presented whereby detailed reference standard data may be constructed in an efficient semi-automatic fashion. A well-distributed set of n landmarks is detected fully automatically in one scan of a pair to be registered. Using a custom-designed interface, observers define corresponding anatomic locations in the second scan for a specified subset of s of these landmarks. The remaining n- s landmarks are matched fully automatically by a thin-plate-spline based system using the s manual landmark correspondences to model the relationship between the scans. The method is applied to 47 pairs of temporal <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> scans, three pairs of brain MR scans and five <b>thoracic</b> <b>CT</b> datasets with synthetic deformations.
