I thank the citizens of Rock River for their aid, but I want to say--I'm going to run this campaign in the farmers' interest, because the interests of this county and of this State are agricultural, and whatever hurts the farmer hurts every other man in the State.

It is not true that the interests of the <b>town</b> <b>dweller</b> and of the farmer are necessarily antagonistic; the cause of the people is the same everywhere. It's like the condition of affairs between England and Ireland. People say that Ireland is fighting England--fighting the English people, {{but that is not the}} fact. The antagonism is between the Irish people and the English landlord. So the fight in America is the people against the special privileges enjoyed by a few. It's because these few generally live in towns that we seem to be fighting the towns.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the market {{segmentation}} of recreational forest services using the concept of ‘sensation seeking’ to describe expectations of <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> towards recreation. In this approach, the variable of landscape dissimilarity is evaluated based on the landscape preferences of <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> for recreational purposes. The urban agglomeration of Białystok and the Knyszyn Forest (North-Eastern Poland) were chosen as the target for this case study. The results of the research suggest that the potential market of recreational forest services of the urban agglomeration of Białystok includes and provides for about 30 % of the inhabitants. The emerging true market of the recreational services of the Knyszyn Forest reaches only about 22 % of the inhabitants of Białystok.

40|$|The {{demographic}} {{implications of}} socioeconomic transition are studied {{among the three}} subsistence categories of the Gangte, a little known tribe from northeast India. Reproductive histories of 444 evermarried women and other data on the 343 households from which these women were drawn were collected from 11 villages representing the 3 transitional groups. A trend of increasing household income and literacy of couples was observed from shifting cultivators to settled agriculturists to the town-dwelling Gangte. The effect of socioeconomic transition is also seen in the constriction {{at the base of}} the age-sex pyramid of the <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> compared with the other subsistence categories, suggesting a relatively lower proportion of children in the 0 - 5 -year-old age group. Although exogamy is practiced among all the subsistence categories, a considerably higher percentage of admixture with non-Gangte is observed among the <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> compared with the others. Overall infant and child mortality among the Gangte is low. However, variation exists among the three subsistence groups in the sense that a considerable reduction is seen from the traditional shifting cultivators to the urbanized <b>town</b> <b>dwellers,</b> reflecting better socioeconomic conditions and greater awareness and accessibility of the <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> to public health amenities. No consistent or perceptible trend is evident in mean number of live births. The genetic implications of this demographic transition are reflected in Crow’s indexes of selection...|$|R

The survey provided data on such topics as the extent of farming in Nakuru town in terms of both geographical distribution and numbers of households, the types of farming in town, the amounts of food produced, the types of inputs used, the constraints which farming in town faces, the characteristics of the urban farming households as opposed to the non-farming households, the reasons to farm in town and the importance attached to it, and the extent of rural farming by Nakuru <b>town</b> <b>dweller...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{topic in}} research on medieval literacy is the growth of so-called literate mentalities. In medieval towns one {{seems to have had}} more chance of being confronted with writing than elsewhere. The readiness on the part of <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> to engage in the use of written documents can be considered as an important sign of changes in thinking and the perception of the world. This urban use of written modes of communication needs to be studied in the context of all modes of communication available to <b>town</b> <b>dwellers.</b> The papers in this volume try to understand medieval urban literacy from a pan-European perspective, in which both western and Byzantine urban societies are taken into account. They cover several areas of medieval Latinitas (Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, England, France and Belgium) as well as medieval Byzantium. Together, they create an opportunity for putting into a comparative perspective not only the phenomenon of urban literacy, but also the different scholarly traditions in approaching the subject. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the market {{segmentation}} of recreational forest services using the concept of ‘sensation seeking’ for describing recreational expectations of <b>town</b> <b>dwellers.</b> The physical activity of <b>town</b> <b>dwellers</b> from the urban agglomeration of Białystok and the Knyszyn Forest (North-Eastern Poland) during outdoor recreation was analysed using this concept. The results of this research suggest that less than thirty percent of inhabitants of the Białystok agglomeration tend to be physically active during outdoor recreation. This is evidence of {{a low level of}} physical culture within the part of the society analysed in this study. Amongst all participants, only seven percent use the Knyszyn Forest for recreational purposes based on physical activity. The limited interest in active recreation in forests that we observed can be attributed to two main causes: 1) the lack of acceptance of a closed forest landscape as a recreational area; 2) the lack of recreational facilities in the Knyszyn Forest that would encourage healthy behaviour during active outdoor recreation...|$|R
