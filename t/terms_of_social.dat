5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group {{states that the}} name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters {{in his or her}} name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> {{class the}} average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

30|$|Recontextualisation of {{perinatal}} depression {{within a}} Social Isolation conceptual framework provides explanation to the moderating effect <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support networks. Social isolation is the counterfactual <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support. Thus the extensive empirical research findings that associate “lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support” with perinatal depression give confidence to explaining {{the cause of}} perinatal depression in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> isolation. Social isolation would not, however, be a necessary mechanism but would be a conditional cause of isolation and loneliness.|$|R
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it was {{interesting}} to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> media space.|$|E
25|$|The {{results for}} 2001 were coded using the Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG).

The classification is specific to Australian needs and was developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The classification is based on the self-perceived group identification approach, using a self assessed response to a direct question. This approach measures the extent to which individuals associate with particular cultural or ethnic groups.|$|E

25|$|Clothes {{were seen}} as an {{expression}} of women’s place in society and were hence, differentiated in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> class. Upper class women, who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of fabrics and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.|$|E
25|$|The Eurasian magpie is {{believed}} {{not only to}} be among the smartest of birds but among the most intelligent of all animals. Along with the jackdaw, the Eurasian magpie's nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, significantly larger than the gibbon's. Like other corvids, such as ravens and crows, their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes' and cetaceans'. A 2004 review suggests that the intelligence of the corvid family to which the Eurasian magpie belongs is equivalent to that of great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas) in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cognition, causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and prospection.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> and {{economic}} development.

The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better health care facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.|$|E

25|$|For Unger, society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was based on}} limited suffrage, with only male citizens 25 {{years of age and}} over, who had paid 15 Japanese Yen or more in national taxes, and who had been resident in their prefecture for at least a year, qualified to vote. The number of eligible voters who met this requirement was 450,872 people out of a total Japanese population of 39,933,478 (1.13%). The high tax requirement meant that voter roles were heavily weighed towards rural landlords and urban entrepreneurs. In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> class, 91% were commoners, and 9% were ex-samurai. Residents of the prefectures in Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku participated; residents Hokkaidō and Okinawa (as “territories”) were excluded from this election. About 95% of those eligible to vote actually cast ballots, although there was no penalty for not doing so.|$|E
25|$|In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> barriers, {{there is}} a {{significant}} gap between formal legal reforms in theory and their practice in reality. In Morocco's rural and underdeveloped areas, legal equality is perceived as less of an immediate priority than basic, everyday needs. High levels of female illiteracy and a strong sense of traditionalism in many rural areas further compound these challenges. Despite educational campaigns undertaken by various governmental and non-governmental actors (often supported by donor nations such as EU member states), levels of awareness about the reforms remain low, especially in many rural areas, where misinformation about the details of the changes has often filled the knowledge gap. Many supporters of the reforms believe that lack of awareness of the law is the primary barrier to its implementation, with a lack of legal literacy {{compounded by the fact that}} many Moroccans speak a Berber dialect rather than the formal Arabic in which the law is actually written.|$|E
