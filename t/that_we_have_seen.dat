500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.

500|$|Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle {{was fairly}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who {{described it as}} a treat for Clamp fans due to the large number of crossover characters in the series. Initial fan response to Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was that it was [...] "Cardcaptor Sakura for guys". Fans speculated that the series would conclude one of Clamp's unfinished series, X, or {{that it would be a}} sequel to Cardcaptor Sakura that focused on the character Syaoran Li. Critics described the series as being marked by several plot twists, with About.com writer Katherine Luther labelling it as [...] "perhaps the [...] "twistiest" [...] of twists <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in anime and manga in quite some time". For the earlier half of the series, Mikhail Koulikov from Anime News Network described the series as settling into a [...] "predictable pattern" [...] that Melissa Harper, also from Anime News Network, described as somewhat slow, and [...] "frankly a bit boring". However, Michael Aronson from Manga Life found the series appealing and accessible to readers who have not read other Clamp series, and he hoped it would remain this accessible for following volumes. He found that the relation between Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic would persuade readers to also read the latter series. Mania Entertainment's Megan Lavey found the introduction to be a [...] "pretty simple love story", while liking the characters' personalities. She liked how the series was connected with xxxHolic and hoped that both series would continue crossing over. In a general overview of the manga, Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin gave positive remarks to the characters' complex personalities and how the plot has been developed throughout its first ten volumes. She recommended that people should buy the series. Active Anime's Blake Waymire found that the change of settings was well done, and he noted how some story arcs could go from dramatic to charming.|$|E

2500|$|It is true {{that these}} general ideas occur in all the old liturgies; {{but in this case}} a {{remarkable}} identity is found even in the words. Some allusions to what were probably older forms in the Canon make the similarity still more striking. Thus Optatus of Mileve says that Mass is offered [...] "pro ecclesiâ, quæ una est et toto orbe terrarum diffusa" [...] (Adv. Parm., III, xii). This represents exactly a Latin version of the [...] "holy Church which is in all the world" [...] <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the Syrian Anaphora above. The Syrian use adds a prayer for [...] "our religious kings and queens" [...] after that for the patriarch and bishop. So the Roman Missal long contained the words [...] "et pro rege nostro N." [...] after [...] "et Antistite nostro N." [...] (see below). It has a prayer for the celebrant himself (Brightman, 90), where the Roman Missal once contained just such a prayer (below). The treatise [...] "De Sacramentis" [...] gives the words on Institution for the Chalice as [...] "Hic est sanguis meus", just as does the Syrian Liturgy.|$|E
2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask {{what you can do}} for your country". President Kennedy in a speech at the White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev.

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this turmoil, which also {{included}} Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan {{in the wake of the}} devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: [...] "Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath. There are both the tragedies and disasters <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region." [...] But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66percent (against 31percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get.|$|E
