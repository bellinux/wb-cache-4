5|$|A Scientology {{representative}} in France {{asserted that the}} Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology, {{and that it was}} not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E
5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not worth taking.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E

5|$|France first toured South Africa {{winning the}} test series in 1958. The Springboks also visited Paris in 1961, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not {{completed}} due to onfield fighting amongst the players.

5|$|In March 1944, {{planning}} for <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, {{a professor of}} physics at Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky.

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> extended for three more months, and in October <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E

5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood.

5|$|The Originals' Test against Wales {{is still}} {{considered}} one of sport's great matches. <b>The</b> <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> played at Cardiff Arms Park, 16 December 1905 in front of 47,000 spectators. The All Blacks were applauded onto the park where they performed their haka {{in front of a}} silent crowd. Once they had applauded their haka, the crowd, led by 'Teddy' Morgan, sang the Welsh national anthem Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers). The match was reportedly the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture.|$|E
5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch.

5|$|When {{time for}} the Scotland Test did arrive, it was {{discovered}} that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements, and had frozen over. The SFU wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. <b>The</b> <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.|$|E

5|$|In {{the match}} against Gloucestershire {{immediately}} before the Third Test, Ring did not bat as Australia reached 7/774 declared, which was their highest {{score of the}} tour and which underpinned an innings victory. Ring took two wickets {{in the space of}} three runs, including Test batsman Charlie Barnett, to end with 2/83 in 25overs as the hosts made 279. After stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett enforced the follow onBradman had rested himselfRing removed Test batsmen Barnett and George Emmett to leave Gloucestershire at 2/20. After resting he resumed bowling with the score at 4/93 and took three more wickets, as the hosts fell to 9/109 and then 132 all out. Ring took 5/47 and bowled the most overs (25) in the second innings. Johnson, however, took 11/100 in the match and retained his place in the team for the Third Test at Old Trafford. <b>The</b> <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> drawn amid inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{commitments}} left MacLaren {{unavailable for}} the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to lose. This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.|$|E

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Test, {{played at}} the Oval, saw England win the toss and bat. They {{compiled}} 280, Mailey taking five wickets. Australia responded with 302, dismissed late on the second day. At stumps, England – in their second innings – were 0/49. A violent thunderstorm inundated the ground overnight, rendering the pitch sticky. Collins attracted {{a great deal of}} negative attention by using the inexperienced Arthur Richardson as a main strike bowler {{at the expense of the}} likes of Mailey and Clarrie Grimmett. The English openers, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, took advantage of this by compiling a 172-run opening partnership. England were bowled out in their second innings for 436, 415 runs ahead.
