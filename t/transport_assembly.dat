For Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the causative agent of a severe hemorrhagic disease, virus–host interactions are poorly investigated.

Our results showed that intact microtubules were required early during virus internalization, and late, during virus assembly and egress. Furthermore, disruption of microtubules resulted in reduced levels of viral RNA while preservation of microtubule dynamics was most important during viral egress. Finally, although CCHFV proteins were redistributed in drug-treated cells, the glycoprotein remained associated with the Golgi apparatus, the organelle of virus budding. Taken together, our results suggest that manipulation of microtubules affects CCHFV entry, replication, assembly and egress...|$|E

40|$|ERV ~ cells {{display a}} number of unusual {{properties}} which are generally viewed as adaptations to their extreme length and regional specialization. The dense and highly organized neurofilament (NF) ~ and microtubule (MT) arrays which serve to support nerve axons provide one example; another is the phenomenon of axonal transport, by which macromolecules synthesized in the cell body move outward along the axon in several relatively discrete components with widely different velocities (3, 22, 32, 95; Fig. 1). During the 1970 s, a crucial connection was made between these two properties of nerve cells by the demonstration that the slowest moving component of axonal transport (called slow component a [SCa]) conveys primarily tubulin and the three proteins comprising NFs (18, 23, 27, 33, 41, 52, 78, 96).

40|$|The {{transport}} of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope is {{mediated by the}} nuclear pore complex (NPC). Using cryo-electron microscopy and image processing we have mapped the interaction of three specific gold probes with the NPC and obtained projection maps of two possible intermediates in nuclear import. The probes used in these experiments were (a) mAb- 414, which cross-reacts with Xenopus nucleoporins containing O-linked N-acetyl glucosamines; (b) wheat germ agglutinin, a transport inhibitor; and (c) nucleoplasmin, a transport substrate. Strong binding sites of the three probes are circularly arrayed on NPCs between radii of 100 and 125 A and may be coextensive. These results suggest that nucleoplasmin-gold (NP-gold) can form at least three distinct complexes with a central <b>transport</b> <b>assembly</b> of the NPC, which may represent intermediates of a multistep protein import pathway.

40|$|We {{placed a}} {{regulatory}} sequence {{derived from the}} GAL 10 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at various distances from the start sites of transcription of two yeast ribosomal protein genes, tcm 1 and cyh 2.

In the absence of galactose, the hybrid genes were transcribed either at a reduced level or essentially not at all. Yeast cells which transcribe the ribosomal protein genes at a reduced rate continued to grow, suggesting that enhanced translation of the ribosomal protein mRNA may permit an adequate rate of synthesis of the corresponding protein. Consistent with this suggestion is the finding that preexisting mRNA decayed at a reduced rate when transcription was halted abruptly by removal of galactose. Yeast cells unable to transcribe tcm 1 or cyh 2 without galactose did not grow. These conditional lethal strains demonstrate that the ribosomal proteins encoded by tcm 1 and cyh 2 are essential; furthermore, these strains are potentially useful for isolating mutations in the tcm 1 and cyh 2 proteins affecting their <b>transport,</b> <b>assembly,</b> or function...|$|E
