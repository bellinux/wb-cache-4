5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the car, Homer realizes he must make it to Central Park to find his family and leave before it gets dark. Ignoring the wheel clamp, he tries to accelerate {{and in the process}} destroys the car's fender. Homer stops by a road construction crew and steals a jackhammer so he can use it to remove <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> The car is freed from <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> but further damaged as a result. Homer races to Central Park and reunites with his family. While driving back to Springfield, the family reflects on their wonderful time, while Homer's hatred for New York remains.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a clamp connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E
25|$|A {{current clamp}} {{is a type}} of {{transformer}} with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage.

25|$|In {{the tension}} joint, the bolt and clamped {{components}} of the joint are designed to transfer an applied tension load through the joint {{by way of the}} clamped components by the design of a proper balance of joint and bolt stiffness. The joint should be designed such that <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> load is never overcome by the external tension forces acting to separate the joint. If the external tension forces overcome <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> load (bolt preload) the clamped joint components will separate, allowing relative motion of the components.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{mode of failure}} is overloading: Operating forces of the {{application}} produce loads that exceed <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> load, causing the joint to loosen over time or fail catastrophically.|$|E

25|$|The most {{vulnerable}} {{section of the}} cable is where it is clamped {{to the end of}} an insulator string, so dampers are typically installed at the nearest anti-nodes (points of maximum displacement) either side of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> There are thus normally two dampers per span, though more can be installed if necessary on longer spans.|$|E
25|$|C-Clamps are hook clamps {{that use}} a {{threaded}} bolt to attach to a pipe or batten {{and to hold}} the instrument secure.

Torque charts are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its property class (fineness of manufacture and fit) and grade (tensile strength).|$|E

25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

40|$|Introducing {{resonant}} inductance and <b>clamping</b> diodes into <b>the</b> full-bridge converter {{can eliminate}} the voltage oscillation across the rectifier diodes {{and increase the}} load range for zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) achievement. The resonant inductance is shorted and its current keeps constant when <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> diode is conducting, and <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> diode is hard turned-off, causing significant reverse recovery loss if the output filter inductance is relatively larger. This paper improves the full-bridge converter by introducing a reset winding in series with the resonant inductance to make <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> diode current decay rapidly when it conducts. The reset winding not only reduces the conduction losses, but also makes <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> diodes naturally turn-off and avoids the reverse recovery. As the diodes are turned off naturally and reverse recovery voltage is avoided the distortions caused in the output voltage is removed to a maximum extend by varying the turns ratio of the transformer. The energy stored in the reset winding is also increased by which the inductor value of the snubber circuit to turn off <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> diodes also increases, which results in reductions in the distortions of the output voltage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMeasuring <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> {{forces on}} {{cylindrical}} workpieces {{is a key}} factor in the geometrical tolerances of such components, especially if they are slender as the case of thin rings. <b>The</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> force, better tolerances will be achieved, but with the disadvantage of reducing friction and, therefore, increasing the risk of slipping. Therefore, achieving a minimum but safe clamping force is a key factor to control the process. Usually, these parts are made in lathes that have concentric plate clutches and these are fixed mechanically by wrenches or hydraulically through the control of pressure by valves. A simple and economic method is proposed to measure <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> forces in lathes, although it is necessary the use of a model for the ring deformation.

40|$|AbstractCarbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRP) {{are mostly}} manufactured near net shape. Nevertheless, a final milling step {{at the edges}} of the cured components is still necessary. Damages which occur during milling or drilling of CFRP lower the durability of the components and increase the production costs. Requirements concerning <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> system for milling or drilling CFRP are rising simultaneously with increasing complexity of the components. This stresses the need for complex clamping systems like linear <b>clamping</b> jaws around <b>the</b> whole workpiece. However such types of clamping systems induce poor accessibility to the component being worked on and hence longer machining time. As a result to the need for complex <b>clamping</b> systems, <b>the</b> production costs are increased. Therefore, several benefits can be achieved by increasing the distances between <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> points of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> system to reduce machining time and production costs. This paper discusses investigations of milling tests with variable <b>clamping</b> conditions of <b>the</b> workpieces.
