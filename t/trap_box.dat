We proposed to use time investment as a natural basis to compare efficiency, since it applies to any method. The results inherently differ from results based on samples or individuals because methods are neither equally demanding nor equally rewarding. We found that most differences between methods arise from their size selectivity. To boost the development of cost-effective protocols, we also identify the best designs for rapid bioassesment by simulating short surveys from the data. Combinations of activity <b>traps</b> and <b>box</b> <b>trap</b> give most species; however, these rapid surveys miss on average more than 40 % of all species in our study.

40|$|Salah satu masalah yang dihadapi dalam pendidikan anak usia dini (PAUD) adalah adanya kegiatan mengajarkan membaca, menulis, dan berhitung pada anak. Padahal anak usia dini tersebut belum mencapai kematangan pada tugas-tugas perkembangan yang menuntut penguasaan kemampuan membaca, menulis dan berhitung. Beranjak dari permasalahan tersebut, penelitian ini bertujuan menghasilkan model pembelajaran berbasis permainan untuk meningkatkan kesiapan belajar membaca, menulis, dan berhitung anak usia dini sesuai dengan karakteristik dan tugas perkembangannya. Pengembangan model ini dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode Research and Development (R&D) yang meliputi sepuluh langkah kegiatan. Kesepuluh langkah model R & D tersebut dikemas dalam tiga tahap penelitian yaitu: (1) studi pendahuluan; (2) pengembangan model; dan (3) Uji validasi model. Pengumpulan data dilakukan melalui wawancara, angket observasi, studi dokumentasi dan tes. Hasil penelitian : (1) Pembelajaran membaca, menulis, dan berhitung pada anak usia dini yang dilaksanakan selama ini dilakukan secara konvensional dan menggunakan pendekatan akademik, yakni menekankan kegiatan latihan tertulis secara individual. (2) Model yang dihasilkan adalah Model Pembelajaran Terpadu berbasis Permainan Kotak Jaring Laba-laba (PT-PKJL), tahapannya terdiri atas : kegiatan awal, yakni menciptakan kondisi belajar yang kondusif, apersepsi dan do’a bersama, kegiatan inti, yakni bermain, pemberian bimbingan, reinforcement, serta kegiatan akhir, yakni refleksi, kesimpulan,cerita bersambung, dan do’a bersama. (3) Model PT-PKJL telah terbukti secara signifikan lebih efektif meningkatkan kesiapan belajar membaca, menulis, dan berhitung anak usia dini dibandingkan dengan model pembelajaran yang selama ini digunakan. Kelebihan model PT-PKJL antara lain: (1) motivasi pendidik dan anak didik tinggi dalam proses penentuan tema, (2) mudah dilakukan, pembelajaran berlangsung alami, (3) mempermudah perencanaan, (4) memudahkan anak untuk melihat berbagai kegiatan yang berbeda, namun saling terkait dalam satu tema, dan (5) dapat memanfaatkan lingkungan sekitar sebagai sumber belajar. Sedangkan kelemahannya antara lain: (1) pendidik kesulitan menentukan tema yang sesuai dengan minat dan tugas perkembangan anak, (2) kegiatan evaluasi autentik dan portofolio memerlukan tenaga, waktu dan peralatan yang rumit, (3) menimbulkan kesan bahwa anak-anak hanya diajak bermain, (4) dibutuhkan waktu dan pikiran untuk mengaitkan tema dengan sumber belajar yang tersedia, (5) membutuhkan waktu untuk beradaptasi dengan model ini. Berdasarkan temuan-temuan penelitian menunjukkan bahwa model PT-PKJL relevan dengan karakteristik anak usia dini, dapat diterapkan dalam proses pembelajaran di kelompok bermain, dan memiliki tingkat keefektifan yang signifikan dalam membantu anak mencapai kesiapan belajar membaca, menulis, dan berhitung yang sesuai dengan minat, karakteristik dan tugas perkembangannya. Maka dengan demikian model PT-PKJL juga memiliki kelayakan untuk dikembangkan pada lembaga-lembaga PAUD. One of the {{problems}} faced by the early age child education (PAUD) {{is a tendency to}} teach reading, writing, and arithmetic for early age children. Actually, they have not reached the development phase which demands to master reading, writing and arithmetic ability. The purpose of this research is to produce a playing based instructional model to increase the readiness of learning to read, to write, and arithmetic for early age children. Besides, it is compatible with their characters and the development phases of them. This development model uses Research and Development (R & D) method, they have ten steps of activities. All of them wrapped in three phases of development, that is: (1) The beginning study; (2) The model development; and (3) The model validation test. This data will be collected to be performed with interview, anklets, observation, documentation study, and test. The result of the research: (1) Learning process of reading, writing and arithmetic for young age children so far has been done conventionally and by using the academic approach, it means that emphasizing the mastery of reading and writing skill and arithmetic by doing exercises writtenly and individually. (2) The resulted model is the integrated learning model based on the <b>trap</b> <b>box</b> of spiders game (PT-PKJL), the stages consist of: the opening activity that is intended to create conducive learning condition, apperception and prayer together, the core activity that is playing, guidance, reinforcement, and the last activities are reflection, conclusion, continued story, and prayer together. (3) PT-PKJL model was confirmed significantly more effective to increase the readiness of learning reading, writing, and arithmetic for the young age children than the models have been used at this time. The advantages of PT-PKJL model are: (1) Educator and children motivation is high enough in the process of deciding themes or topic. (2) Easy to do, and learning process lasts more naturally. (3) Easier to make a plan. (4) Easier for children to see some different activities, but relating in one theme/topic and (5) It can use the round environment as the source of study. While the weaknesses are: (1) the educator has a difficulty to decide the theme that is suitable to the desire and children development. (2) The authentic evaluation activity and portfolio need more energy, time and complicated equipment. (3) Causing the image that children are just invited to play game. (4) Need more time and thought to connect every theme with the available sources of study. (5) Need more time to adapt with this model. Based on the research findings, it shows that PT-PKJL model is relevant to the characteristic of the early age children, applicable in learning process for play group, and has significant effectivity level which is important to help the children reach the readiness to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic which is suitable with desire, characters and the development phases. So, it is properly for PT-PKJL model to be developed and implemented in educational institution of PAUD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A trap {{made from}} {{low-cost}} materials and using an attractant of a yeast mixture producing carbon dioxide {{was designed and}} evaluated to collect adult Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes. The <b>Trap</b> Mosquito <b>Box</b> prototype was tested against the “standards” BG-Sentinel traps and CDC backpack aspirator in the field. The mean numbers of mosquitoes (± standard deviation) caught by the three different collection methods were: <b>Trap</b> Mosquito <b>Box</b> 2. 42 (± 3. 08), BG-Sentinel trap 2. 86 (± 3. 71), and backpack aspirator 0. 59 (± 0. 90). Statistical tests showed the <b>Trap</b> Mosquito <b>Box</b> and BG-Sentinel <b>trap</b> were equally effective in collecting A. aegypti and both methods were significantly different than the backpack aspirator. Emission of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast mixture was greatest during the first hours after incubation in a laboratory and captured the most mosquitoes in the <b>Trap</b> Mosquito <b>Box.</b> Production of carbon dioxide [Y = - 631. 24 + 941. 26 (log x) ] {{and the rate of}} mosquitoes captured per time period [Y = 20. 29 + 23. 50 (log x) ] were best explained by logarithmic regressions.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the infection with gastrointestinal helminthes in small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) and its epidemiologic aspects in Iran. Methods: During June 2012 to July 2013, {{a total of}} 13 small Indian mongooses were caught using live <b>trap</b> <b>boxes</b> in an area located near Shiraz, southern of Iran. Captured animals were euthanized, eviscerated {{and parts of the}} alimentary tract were inspected. Two mongooses showed a nematode attached to the mucosa of the stomach. Results: According to the main morphological characteristics, the specimens belonged to the genus Spirura (Blanchard 1849). This study represents the first evidences of the infection with Spirura sp. in Herpestes auropunctatus in the world. Conclusions: Because the animal can invade and appear in the habitat of the other animal populations including omnivores or carnivores, it seems that mongooses in this area could have a high potential for the transmission of the infection with the spirurid nematodes to a large range of animals. Thus, besides the necessity of conducting the controlling programs, autochthonous dogs, cats and rodents should be included in more epidemiological studies in this region...|$|R

Specifically, feral hogs have caused damage to vegetative plantings used in the reclamation process of surface lignite mines. In addition to vegetative losses, erosion control problems and water quality impacts have been noted. <b>Box</b> and corral <b>traps</b> were evaluated for their effectiveness in capturing feral hogs. Six male and 10 female hogs were radiomonitored from January 1998 - January 1999 at Big Brown Lignite Mine in Freestone County, Texas. Annual range size, habitat use, habitat selection, and diel movements of the feral hogs were determined using a geographic information system. Corral traps were more efficient than <b>box</b> <b>traps</b> in capturing feral hogs (P < 0. 000). Male feral hogs had a mean annual range of 15. 8 km[]. Female hogs had a significantly (P < 0. 02) smaller annual range of 6. 5 km[]. Hogs preferred reclaimed wildlife vegetation plantings and unmixed riparian corridors on the mine site. Screening cover and free water were important landscape features that influenced hog movements. Feral hogs moved greater distances from free water and screening cover deleing nighttime hours. In addition, seasonal effects of distance from these landscape features were significant. Feral hogs traveled greater distances from both gee water and screening during winter and spring, but during fall and summer months, they remained closer (P < 0. 0001) to water and cover sources. Based on the information obtained from the data analysis, management strategies for reducing hog impacts at the mine site were developed. In order to decrease feral hog impacts on the mine site, use of corral <b>traps,</b> <b>box</b> <b>traps,</b> and vegetation management was recommended...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} tree {{squirrels}} {{are divided into}} three groups: large tree squirrels, pine squirrels, and flying squirrels. Large tree squirrels include fox (Sciurus niger), eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis), western gray (Sciurus griseus), and tassel-eared (Sciurus aberti) squirrels. Fox squirrels (Fig. 1) measure 18 to 27 inches (46 to 69 cm) from nose to tip of tail. They weigh about 1 3 / 4 pounds (787 g) to 2 1 / 4 pounds (1, 012 g). Color varies greatly, from all black in Florida to silver gray with a white belly in Maryland. Georgia fox squirrels usually have a black face. Ohio and Michigan fox squirrels are grizzled gray-brown above with an orange underside. Sometimes several color variations occur in a single population. Eastern gray squirrels are also variable in color. Some have a distinct reddish cast to their gray coat. Black ones are common in some northern parts of their range. Eastern gray squirrels measure 16 to 20 inches (41 to 51 cm). They weigh from 1 1 / 4 pounds (567 g) to 1 3 / 4 pounds (794 g). The western gray squirrel is gray above with sharply distinct white underparts. Size {{is similar to that}} of the eastern gray squirrel. Tassel-eared squirrels are similar in size to gray squirrels and have several color phases. The most common is gray above with a broad reddish band down the back. Black tufted ears are their most distinguishing characteristic (the tufts are larger in winter, about 1 inch [2. 5 cm]). There are two species of pine squirrels: the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and Douglas pine squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii). Pine squirrels are 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) in total length and weigh 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 pounds (151 to 303 g). Red squirrels are red-brown above with white underparts. Douglas squirrels are gray-brown above with yellowish underparts. Both species have small ear tufts and often have a black stripe separating the dark upper color from the light belly. Two species of flying squirrels occur in North America. The southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long. The northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) averages 2 inches (5 cm) longer. It can be difficult to distinguish between the two; both may be various shades of gray or brown above and lighter below. A sharp line of demarcation separates the darker upper color from the lighter belly. The most distinctive characteristics of flying squirrels are the broad webs of skin connecting the fore and hind legs at the wrists, and the distinctly flattened tail. Exclusion:Install sheet metal bands on isolated trees to prevent damage to developing nuts. Close external openings to buildings to stop damage to building interiors. Place an 18 -inch (46 -cm) section of 4 -inch (10 -cm) diameter plastic pipe or a one-way door over openings to allow squirrels to leave and prevent them from returning. Plastic tubes on wires may prevent access to buildings. Cultural Methods: Remove selected trees or their branches to prevent access to structures. Repellents: Naphthalene (moth balls), Ro-pel, capsaicin, and polybutenes are registered for controlling tree squirrels. Toxicants: None are registered. Fumigants: None are registered. Trapping: Leghold <b>traps.</b> <b>Box</b> and cage <b>traps.</b> Rat snap <b>traps.</b> <b>Box</b> choker <b>traps.</b> Shooting: Effective where firearms are permitted.
