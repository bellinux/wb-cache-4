The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued.

5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
