Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E

Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council is not {{a single}} post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> rotates between the states, in an order {{predefined}} by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and Slovenia with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b> A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested. The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the High Representative since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> was {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. <b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. <b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E
5|$|The Socialist Republic of Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia {{was led by}} a {{group of}} {{communist}} party officials, who formed a collective Presidency with the president of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> at its head. The first democratic elections of 1990 did not elect members of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> directly. Rather, the parliament was tasked with filling these positions as it had done in the socialist period. The HDZ won the elections and its leader Tuđman assumed <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> on 30 May 1990. On 25 July of the same year, the parliament passed several constitutional amendments, including amendment LXXI, which created the position of President and Vice-Presidents. The Christmas Constitution, passed on 22 December 1990, established the government as a semi-presidential system and called for presidential elections.|$|E

5|$|The {{framework}} of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> formed between 1803 and 1827. The districts of Ahmadabad, Bharuch, and Kaira in Gujarat were {{taken over by}} the Bombay Government in 1805 and enlarged in 1818. The numerous small states of Kathiawar and Mahikantha were organised into princely states under British suzerainty between 1807 and 1820. Baji Rao II, the last of the Maratha Peshwas, was defeated by the British in the Battle of Kirkee, which took place near Poona in the Deccan on 5 November 1817. Following his defeat, the whole of the Deccan (except Satara and Kolhapur), and certain parts of Gujarat, were included in <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b> The districts included were Khandesh, Belgaum, Dharwar, Ratnagiri, Kolaba (except Alibag taluka), Poona, Ahmadnagar, Nasik. Aden was incorporated in 1839. Alibag taluka was annexed in 1840 and added to <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b> Sind province, which included the districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Shikarpur, Thar and Parkar, and Upper Sind Frontier, were annexed in 1847. In 1848, the districts of Satara and Bijapur were added to <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b> In 1853, Panch Mahals in Gujarat was leased from the Scindias. The Canara district, which was under Madras Presidency, was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1860. South Canara remained under Madras Presidency, while North Canara was transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1861.

5|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> is {{administrative}} and political.

The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council.
