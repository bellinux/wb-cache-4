5|$|Two {{men were}} {{killed during the}} {{construction}} of the bridge. In 1885, a 22-year-old woman named Sarah Ann Henley survived a suicide attempt off the bridge when her billowing skirts acted as a parachute and she landed in the thick mud banks of the <b>tidal</b> <b>River</b> Avon at low tide; she subsequently lived into her eighties.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a <b>tidal</b> <b>river,</b> and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|There was {{initially}} no direct line from London to Wales as the <b>tidal</b> <b>River</b> Severn was too wide to cross. Trains instead {{had to follow}} a lengthy route via Gloucester, where the river was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge. Work on the Severn Tunnel had begun in 1873, but unexpected underwater springs delayed the work and prevented its opening until 1886.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlow in <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> {{periodically}} propagates upstream or downstream under tidal influence. Hydrodynamic models {{based on}} the Saint-Venant equations (the SVN model) are extensively used to model <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers.</b> A force-corrected term expressed as the combination of flow velocity and the change rate of the tidal level was developed to represent tidal effects in the SVN model. A momentum equation incorporating with the corrected term was derived based on Newton's second law. By combing the modified momentum equation with the continuity equation, an improved SVN model for <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> (the ISVN model) was constructed. The simulation of a tidal reach of the Qiantang River shows that the ISVN model performs better than the SVN model. It indicates that the corrected force derived for tidal effects is reasonable; the ISVN model provides an appropriate enhancement of the SVN model for flow simulation of <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers...</b>|$|R
30|$|However, despite {{land use}} and its linkage with hydrochemistry being center of {{attention}} to many researchers in the recent past, <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> in populous deltas have attracted little attention. <b>Tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> in coastal deltas are dynamic in terms of variations in settings (e.g. Well 1995); changes of courses (e.g., Zhang et al. 2010), rate of accretion and erosion (e.g., Rogers et al. 2013) {{and the amount of}} water discharge/intake over short period. Such characteristics of <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> lead to dynamic changes to coastal landscape. Due to high diversity and biological resources, such river basins are also exposed to maximum human perturbation resulting in various land use (e.g., Auerbach et al. 2015; Gain et al. 2017; Mutahara et al. 2017). The dynamism of <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers,</b> frequent changes in flow and multipurpose use of land resources poses complex impacts of the hydrochemistry and water quality. Therefore, integrated water resource management in such regions is quite difficult and requires in-depth research efforts and high-resolution monitoring data.|$|R
5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The <b>tidal</b> <b>river</b> section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E
5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a <b>tidal</b> <b>river,</b> accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00 that evening, {{following}} the clearance of nearby Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, the Australians sent two companies {{across the river}} to establish a bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions {{on either side of}} the road. Shortly afterwards North Korean forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The North Koreans then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 North Korean activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among the Australians which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing <b>tidal</b> <b>river.</b> Further artillery support was called-in by the Australians at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the North Koreans in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, the Australians sent another platoon across the river to reinforce the companies on the western bank.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{rating curve}} model using two water level {{measurements}} is proposed for <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers.</b> It {{is based on}} the Manning-Strickler equation adapted for possible negative slopes resulting from a negative discharge (upstream directed). The model calibration can be achieved thanks to two parameters only: the Strickler coefficient and the temporal lag between the measured slope and the slope to be applied at the reference section. The model has been applied to two <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> for which ADCP gaugings have been achieved during two tidal cycles: the Saigon River in Vietnam and the Seine River in France. Results are encouraging for the Saigon River where water level variations remain mild. For the Seine River case, results are not as good due to a sharp variation of the water level and discharge during the flow tide that makes the calibration difficult. Nevertheless, the proposed model appears to be valid for <b>tidal</b> <b>rivers</b> as soon as the discharge temporal gradient during the tide flow remains moderate...|$|R
5|$|The Aire and Calder still fulfils its {{original}} purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly. More recent canals now {{also make the}} Navigation a vital link in the English and Welsh connected inland waterway network. Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which connects to the Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal connects to the Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, which {{can be reached via}} the New Junction Canal, forms a link with Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the south west, and the <b>tidal</b> <b>River</b> Trent at Keadby to the east.|$|E
25|$|Water {{from the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>River</b> Ouse is {{prevented}} {{from entering the}} Derwent {{by means of a}} barrage at Barmby on the Marsh.

25|$|The {{owners of}} land {{near to the}} river complained in 1722 that the new locks and weirs caused them to lose income because their meadows were more often flooded.
