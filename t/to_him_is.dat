5|$|Hemlock Hoax, the Detective is an American short comedy film {{produced}} and distributed in 1910 by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The silent film features a detective named Hemlock Hoax {{who tries to}} solve a murder, which unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> a practical joke being played on him by two young boys. It {{was one of many}} shorts designed to derive its humor from a sleuth whose name was similar to Sherlock Holmes.|$|E
5|$|In the lower-left {{corner of}} the {{painting}} holding a document bearing the royal seal, stands Bartolommeo Berrecci, architect who rebuilt Royal Wawel Castle. Next <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> Seweryn Boner, an important burgher and banker. His face {{is one of the}} two self-portraits of Jan Matejko. The second is the face of the royal jester Stańczyk. As Berrecci, Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence, dominating the scene, with a royal scepter in his hand.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund's Column in Warsaw. The column, {{dedicated}} to his father, was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. He was less interested in decorative architecture; he supported the construction of two palaces in Warsaw – Kazanowski Palace and Villa Regia. Among other works sponsored by or dedicated <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> Guido Reni's The Rape of Europa.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that we do have.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Clisby's {{total number}} of {{victories}} in his short career range from nine to twenty or more, but the most common—and official—score attributed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> sixteen. The loss {{of much of the}} RAF's documentation in the chaotic retreat through France and across the English Channel in May 1940 meant that many squadron records and combat claims had to be reconstructed from the memory of surviving personnel. Even the date of Clisby's death is unclear, some sources (including the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) claiming 14May rather than the following day. Regardless of the exact date, he was the first RAF ace of the war to be lost in action. Clisby was buried in the military cemetery at Choloy in north-eastern France. His name appears on Supplementary Panel12 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.|$|E

5|$|Govinda Vaidya, {{a native}} of Srirangapatna, wrote Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in sangatya metre (a {{composition}} meant to be rendered {{to the accompaniment of}} a musical instrument), the book describes the king's court, popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. <b>To</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> ascribed the famous treatise on music called Geetha Gopala. Though inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing Geetha Govinda, it had an originality of its own and was written in saptapadi metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the brahmin poet Lakshmisa and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (Hadibadeya Dharma, late 17th century) writing notable works.|$|E
5|$|Harvey died in 1830 at {{his family}} estate of Rolls Park and {{was buried in}} the Harvey family crypt at St Andrews Church at Hempstead in Essex, which {{contains}} the remains of over 50 family members, including his ancestor's brother, Dr. William Harvey. His coffin is still in the crypt, and can be viewed on request. On the wall of church is a hatchment in his honour originally placed shortly after his death and restored in 1958 after it was destroyed in the partial collapse of the church in 1884. A large wall memorial <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> also visible in the church, which also commemorates his youngest son William, who died in 1823 aged 22.|$|E
5|$|Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian {{documents}} (as Shilkanni {{and other}} epithets) and probably {{also by the}} Books of Kings (as King So), while Manetho's epitomes seem to have ignored him. He is undoubtedly attested by the well-known Victory Stela of Piye on which he is depicted while prostrating {{in front of the}} owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another finding almost certainly referring <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet, found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast whoas the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings' motherscan only be Osorkon IV's mother.|$|E

5|$|Sri {{is left in}} {{the living}} room as Aminah and their mother go to tend to Aminah's child, while their father goes to read the newspaper. Mahmud comes in, and quietly asks Sri to help him. He reveals that he had {{registered}} to join PETA several weeks prior and was to leave for training that very night, but was unsure of how Aminah would accept it. Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} also {{is mentioned}} in the historical works by writers of {{the third and fourth}} century of the Muslim era. These include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, and quotes attributed to him (the sira and hadith literature), which provide further information on Muhammad's life. The earliest surviving written sira (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed <b>to</b> <b>him)</b> <b>is</b> Ibn Ishaq's Life of God's Messenger written some 120 to 130years after Muhammad's death. Although the original work is lost, portions of it survive in the recensions of Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari. Another early source is the history of Muhammad's campaigns by al-Waqidi (d. 823).|$|E
5|$|The leading {{portrait}} {{painter of}} {{the second half of the}} century was Henry Raeburn (1756–1823). He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers, adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition of Joshua Reynolds. The most famous painting attributed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, known as The Skating Minister. He became a knight in 1822 and the King's painter and limner in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{resident}} of Number 1 was Thomas Brock who acted as trustee for John Wood his son-in-law, {{although he was}} rarely lived there as he was the town clerk of Chester. His tenant was Henry Sandford, a retired Irish MP who rented the house from 1776 {{until his death in}} Bath in 1796. He was described as a 'gentleman of the most benevolent disposition'. William Wilberforce stayed at Number 2 in 1798. Christopher Anstey, a well-known writer of the time, was resident in number 4 from 1770 until 1805, although the plaque <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> placed on number 5. Jean Baptiste, Vicomte du Barre took over number 8 in 1778 and hosted parties and gambling. He died in a duel on Claverton Down and is buried in the churchyard at the Church of St Nicholas in Bathampton. From 1768 to 1774 number 9 was home to Philip Thicknesse, a soldier of fortune. Number 11 was home to the family of Thomas Linley, a singing-master and conductor of the concerts from 1771. His second daughter Elizabeth Ann Linley, a singer in her own right, eloped with the playwright and poet Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The centre house of the crescent (#16) was used as a residence and to host blue stocking events by Elizabeth Montagu.|$|E

50|$|David Rijckaert II was earlier {{believed}} to have been a painter of still lifes as well as landscapes. The current view is that he did not paint landscapes as the attribution of landscapes <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> the result of a mix-up with his brother Martin, a prominent landscape painter. Genre scenes formerly attributed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>were</b> likely by his son David III.|$|R
