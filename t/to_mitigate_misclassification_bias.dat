40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{provides}} misclassification {{rates for}} current cigarette smokers who report themselves as nonsmokers. Such rates {{are important in}} determining smoker <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> in the estimation of relative risks in passive smoking studies. METHODS: True smoking status, either occasional or regular, was determined for individual current smokers in 3 existing studies of nonsmokers by inspecting the cotinine levels of body fluids. The new data, combined with an approximately equal amount in the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report on passive smoking and lung cancer, yielded misclassification rates that not only had lower standard errors but also were stratified by sex and US minority majority status. RESULTS: The misclassification rates for the important category of female smokers misclassified as never smokers were, respectively, 0. 8 %, 6. 0 %, 2. 8 %, and 15. 3 % for majority regular, majority occasional, US minority regular, and US minority occasional smokers. Misclassification rates for males were mostly somewhat higher. CONCLUSIONS: The new information supports EPA's conclusion that smoker <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> is small. Also, investigators are advised {{to pay attention to}} minority/majority status of cohorts when correcting for smoker <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias...</b>|$|R
40|$|Brain {{computer}} interaction (BCI) {{technologies have}} proven effective in utilizing single-trial classification algorithms to detect target images in rapid serial visualization presentation tasks. While many {{factors contribute to}} the accuracy of these algorithms, a critical aspect that is often overlooked concerns the feature similarity between target and non-target images. In most real-world environments there are likely to be many shared features between targets and non-targets resulting in similar neural activity between the two classes. It is unknown how current neural-based target classification algorithms perform when qualitatively similar target and non-target images are presented. This study address this question by comparing behavioral and neural classification performance across two conditions: first, when targets were the only infrequent stimulus presented amongst frequent background distracters; and second when targets were presented together with infrequent non-targets containing similar visual features to the targets. The resulting findings show that behavior is slower and less accurate when targets are presented together with similar non-targets; moreover, single-trial classification yielded high levels of misclassification when infrequent non-targets are included. Furthermore, we present an approach <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> the image <b>misclassification.</b> We use confidence measures to assess the quality of single-trial classification, and demonstrate that a system in which low confidence trials are reclassified through a secondary process can result in improved performance...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} found {{protective}} effects of low/moderate (hereafter “light”) alcohol consumption compared with “abstinence” on mortality, health and wage. Some of these studies have been criticised because former drinkers have been included among the abstainers, which may overstate the protective effect of light alcohol consumption. It has also been proposed, but not shown, that the commonly pooled group of light drinkers and former heavy drinkers would understate the protective effect of light drinking. We also suggest that former abstainers might cause the same effect when pooled with light drinkers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study whether pooled groups risk create bias in the form of misclassification and confounding. The analysis focuses on: ‘former drinker error’ (pooling of lifelong abstainers and former drinkers); ‘former abstainer error’ (pooling of former abstainers and lifelong light drinkers); and ‘former heavy drinker error’ (pooling of light drinkers with and without a history of heavy drinking). Swedish panel data were used in a multinomial logit model, presenting odds ratios when comparing the subgroups. The results demonstrate that commonly pooled groups are heterogeneous with respect to a number of variables, which may implicate confounding. Given appropriate controls, <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> is likely in the pooled group of light drinkers. The direction of the <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias,</b> however, is to underestimate the beneficial effect of light alcohol consumption on wage and can therefore not explain the wage penalty of abstinence compared to light drinking.

40|$|Many {{issues in}} {{strategy}} and technology management are categorical. Errors in classification of the dependent variable cause systematic bias in regression estimates. In {{the context of the}} linear probability model, we characterize the <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> as being proportional to the difference between two measures. One is the “bias ” in the explanatory variable, conditional on false negative, multiplied by the probability of false negative. The other is the “bias ” in the explanatory variable, conditional on false positive, multiplied by the probability of false positive. Further, the <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> decreases with the variance of the explanatory variable. We apply the theoretical proposition to an analysis of the effect of human capital on the mobility of scientists and engineers.

In MEMO's case-control studies, patients are identified using computerized ICD 9 diagnosis codes, the original medical records are retrieved and checked, and only patients fulfilling case inclusion criteria are used. The 20 - 30 % of patients for whom medical records cannot be found are usually excluded. The aim is to eliminate <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias.</b> However, selection bias may be introduced if availability of medical records is associated with exposure.

To assess misclassification, odds ratios (with 95 % CI) for recent exposure to NSAIDs were compared in repeated studies that used all patients identified by ICD 9 codes, with studies using validated cases only.

40|$|Contemporary {{literature}} {{pertaining to}} “race” reveals {{that it is}} an arbitrary socio-political construct. Contemporary population surveillance continues to use racial and ethnic variables when describing population parameters in the United States. ^ Through an analysis tracing the historical process of shifting racial/ethnic categories and identities {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century United States, this dissertation investigates why vital statistics researchers continue to use these variables when describing patterns of health and disease. I define, trace, and investigate race as socio-historical process and hypothesize that it is invalid to assume that a racial classificatory standard exists. As a socio-historical process, racial categorizations and identifications vary over time and evidence of <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> contribute to their invalidity. However, I do not assume that low <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> equates validity. This assumption is potentially flawed and may lead to misguided research attempting to improve validity through reliability. Rather, low <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> in reality masks the unstable and shifting nature of racial and ethnic categories and identifications. ^ The data used in this investigation is representative of individuals dying from tubercular infections in Manhattan Borough between 1890 – 1930. Similar to the present, the four-decade period, 1890 – 1930 was a time of rapid population growth of New York City and a period of international/national ethnic migration. International immigrant populations consisted of those individuals originating from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and the Caribbean; National migrants included African Americans and other marginalized “Native born” groups. All these populations shared a common experience of material hardship, resulting in their being at a higher risk for a number of communicable infectious and contagious diseases. However, the conflation of assigned race with socio-economic status adds a further dimension to be explored. ^ The study demonstrates that the United States possesses a racial culture where individuals both racially self-identify and impose racial identifications on others. Health and vital statisticians actively assist in the perpetuation and re-invention of racial culture when they collect, report and interpret data using racial variables.

So, I reviewed possible relationships between smoke load and heart disease levels across genders, educational strata, years, and leading studies.

Household help might induce misclassification errors. The aim of the present analysis was to study associations between household exposure to cleaning sprays and current asthma in elderly women, taking into account household help. MethodsA nested case–control survey on respiratory health was undertaken among a random sample of French women from the E 3 N study. Data were available for 570 women (235 with current asthma and 335 without asthma history; 68 years old on average, 59 % never smokers). Three estimates of domestic exposure were used: 1) self-reported, 2) using principal component analysis, 3) a composite score for sprays. Associations between domestic exposures and asthma were assessed by logistic regression, adjusted for age, educational level, BMI and smoking status. Analyses were further stratified on household help in order to evaluate a potential <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias.</b> ResultsAmong women without household help (n =  325), a significant association was observed between weekly use of at least one spray and current asthma (OR [95 % CI]: 1. 86 [1. 04 – 3. 33]).

The authors present a simple yet easy- to-use Stata command to adjust the relative risk for exposure <b>misclassification,</b> selection <b>bias,</b> and an unmeasured confounder. This command implements both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. It allows the user to specify a variety of probability distributions for the bias parameters, which are used to simulate distributions for the bias-adjusted exposure – disease relative risk. We illustrate the command by applying it to a case – control study of occupational resin exposure and lung-cancer deaths. By using plausible probability distributions for the bias parameters, investigators can report results that incorporate their uncertainties regarding systematic errors and thus avoid overstating their certainty about the effect under study.

Results show that (i) relative odds of breast cancer and their confidence intervals may vary according to definitions of menopause; (ii) age-based definitions of menopause are associated with moderate differential <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> between cases and controls; (iii) nulliparity, late age at first birth and family history of breast cancer seem to be specific risk factors for pre- but not postmenopausal breast cancer when cutoff for menopausal status is 10 years or more after last menses; and (iv) when information on menstrual history is not available, 50 years of age may be the best proxy for all menses-based definitions of menopause.

DESIGN: Pooled analysis of prospective population-based HIV cohort studies in Masaka (Uganda) Kisesa (Tanzania), and Manicaland (Zimbabwe). METHODS: Women aged 15 - 49 who had ever tested for HIV were included. Analyses were censored at antiretroviral treatment roll out. Fertility rate ratios were calculated to see the relationship of duration of HIV infection on fertility, adjusting for background characteristics. Survivorship and <b>misclassification</b> <b>biases</b> on age-specific subfertility estimates from cross-sectional surveys were estimated by reclassifying person time from the cohort data to simulate cross-sectional surveys and comparing fertility rate ratios to true cohort results.

Areal estimates are frequently used for resource inventories, management planning, and assessment analyses. Ms-classification causes bias in these statistical areal estimates. For example, if {{a small percentage}} of a common cover type is misclassified as a rare cover type, then the area occupied by the rare type can be severely overestimated. Many categories are rare in detailed classification systems. I present an informal method to anticipate the approximate mag-nitude of this bias in statistical areal estimates, before a remote sensing study is conducted. If the anticipated magnitude i s unacceptable, then statistical calibration methods should be used to produce unbiased areal estimates.

MAIN RESULTS: The age standardised mortality rate in Spain is lower than in other developed countries (USA or Estonia) and equal to Norwegian and Finland rates; but whereas in these countries the trend is to decrease, the Spanish rate has increased during this period, because of a cohort effect. A <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias</b> could be responsible for the trend in women aged 40 and older but the increasing trend in younger women could not be interpreted as espurious. The Gompertzian analysis suggests an increase in environmental factors causing cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical cancer mortality rates are increasing in Spain because of environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|I examine {{evidence}} on private sector union wage {{gaps in the}} U. S. The consensus opinion among labor economists of an average union premium of roughly 15 percent is called into question. Two forms of measurement error create a downward bias in standard wage gap estimates. Match bias results from Census earnings imputation procedures that do not include union status as a match criterion. Downward bias is roughly equal to the proportion of workers with imputed earnings, currently about 30 percent. Misclassification of union status causes additional attenuation in union gap measures. This bias has worsened as private sector density has declined, since an increasing proportion of workers designated as union are instead nonunion workers. Corrections for <b>misclassification</b> and match <b>bias</b> lead to estimated union gaps substantially higher than standard estimates, but with less of a downward trend since the mid- 1980 s. Private sector union gaps corrected for these biases are estimated from the CPS for 1973 - 2001. The uncorrected estimate for 2001 is. 13 log points. Correction for match bias increases the gap to. 18 log points; further correction for <b>misclassification</b> <b>bias,</b> based on an assumed 2 percent error rate, increases the gap to. 24. Reexamination of the skill-upgrading hypothesis leads {{to the conclusion that}} higher union gap estimates are plausible. The conventional wisdom of a 15 percent union wage premium warrants reexamination...|$|R

30|$|The {{inability}} of wind turbines <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> or ride through grid disturbances poses new challenges to operation stability in electric power systems [7]. Small signal or large signal disturbances also cause stability problems in conventional electric power systems. Based on dynamic {{characteristics of the}} load, the process to secure operation stability involves disturbance identification, dynamic control of generations, special protection schemes for system security, etc. Dynamic control of generations responds to disturbances in three ways: active power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> phase disturbance, active power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> frequency disturbance, and reactive power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> voltage disturbance. With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net dynamics of generations exhibits two new features: decreasing ability <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> disturbances and decreasing ability to survive disturbances. The study shows that these features first impact voltage stability at the interconnection and further impact angle and frequency stability of the system when the penetration level grows. Large-scale integration of wind therefore requires a substantial increase of the ability of wind plants <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> and survive grid disturbances.|$|R
