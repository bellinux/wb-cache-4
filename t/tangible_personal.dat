Sales tax applies to the sale, rental or lease of <b>tangible</b> <b>personal</b> property and some services. Food is taxed, but prescription drugs are not.

60|$|Why this perversity, if it {{were not}} in a generous fit?--which it was not. Why should Gowan, very much the {{superior}} of Blandois of Paris, and very well able to pull that prepossessing gentleman to pieces and find out the stuff he was made of, take up with such a man? In the first place, he opposed the first separate wish he observed in his wife, because her father had paid his debts and it was desirable to take an early opportunity of asserting his independence. In the second place, he opposed the prevalent feeling, because with many capacities of being otherwise, he was an ill-conditioned man. He found a pleasure in declaring that a courtier with the refined manners of Blandois ought to rise to the greatest distinction in any polished country. He found a pleasure in setting up Blandois as the type of elegance, and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces. He seriously protested that the bow of Blandois was perfect, that the address of Blandois was irresistible, and that the picturesque ease of Blandois would be cheaply purchased ({{if it were}} not a gift, and unpurchasable) for a hundred thousand francs. That exaggeration in the manner of the man which has been noticed as appertaining to him and to every such man, whatever his original breeding, as certainly as the sun belongs to this system, was acceptable to Gowan as a caricature, which he found it a humorous resource to have at hand for the ridiculing of numbers of people who necessarily did more or less of what Blandois overdid. Thus he had taken up with him; and thus, negligently strengthening these inclinations with habit, and idly deriving some amusement from his talk, he had glided into a way of having him for a companion. This, though he supposed him to live by his wits at play-tables and the like; though he suspected him to be a coward, while he himself was daring and courageous; though he thoroughly knew him to be disliked by Minnie; and though he cared so little for him, after all, that if he had given her any <b>tangible</b> <b>personal</b> cause to regard him with aversion, he would have had no compunction whatever in flinging him out of the highest window in Venice into the deepest water of the city.|$|E

40|$|This project {{combines}} {{service learning}} with narrative writing (fiction and non-fiction) {{as an effective}} tool for the discovery and communication of social understanding; more specifically, the project discusses white privilege in literary form. Four short stories and seven vignettes, drawn from service learning experience {{over the course of}} three years, are used as a tool for academics beyond the classroom. These narrative pieces are directed toward any audience of students. Intended to move beyond what students learn in textbooks about statistics, the stories reveal the abstract ideas of white privilege in a <b>tangible</b> and <b>personal</b> way. These stories and vignettes, developed from the definitive ideas of Peggy McIntosh on the concept of white privilege in combination with real-life service experiences, introduce examples of the blindnesses from which most Caucasian students suffer. They then reveal what can be seen as examples of oppression within various situations, including those of education, child health care, poverty in relation to home environments, violence, financial stereotyping, and the titles children of color give to members of the white race...|$|R

40|$|The Malaysian airline {{sector has}} become {{increasingly}} competitive {{in the past decade}} especially in the low cost carrier industry. The growing competition has prompted the airline management to focus on generating favorable customers' perceptions of their service as favorable perceptions encourage repeat purchase. It is very important for the airline to retain existing customers and attracting new customers to ensure they remain profitable in the Malaysia aviation industry. Upon the preliminary stage of this study, the researcher found a limited conceptual gap in marketing literature as there has very limited been publishing research on service quality, customer satisfaction or behavioral intentions on the low cost airline industry in Malaysia. By identifying the dimensions of service quality, and empirically examining the interrelationships among the service quality, passenger satisfaction and behavioral intentions, this study hopefully will fill the gap found. The {{purpose of this study is}} to empirically identify and examine the relationships of service quality dimension, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions in passengers of low-cost carriers in Malaysian market. A sample of 272 passengers who had travelled on LCCs in Malaysia few hours after their flight are surveyed in order to identify the sub-dimensions of service quality in Malaysia and test hypothesised relationships among the constructs of service quality, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Using exploratory factor analysis, the study finds the importance of the dimensions of service quality such as; assurance, aircraft <b>tangibles,</b> <b>personal,</b> terminal <b>tangibles,</b> special offers and freebies, reliability, and ground service contribute to their satisfaction level of low cost airline in Malaysia. The result of regression analysis revealed that the passenger satisfaction with the service-quality dimensions that were found in this study showed to be very important in explaining behavioral intentions. Satisfied passengers are mostly influenced by airport tangibles, personnel professionalism and ground arrangement. Such customers engage in positive word-of mouth communication have fairly repurchase intentions. This study provides a framework in understanding the effects of the proposed service quality sub-dimensions of satisfaction and behavioural intentions of low cost airline in Malaysia. Satisfaction was also supported as a mediating effect on the relationship between service quality and behaviour intentions. Practically, the research will benefits the manager in understanding of perceived passengers importance of the service quality of their airline, the level of satisfaction and behavioural intentions off a low cost carrier in Malaysia...|$|R

As {{a set of}} cognitive abilities, critical thinking skills provide students with <b>tangible</b> academic, <b>personal,</b> and professional benefits that may ultimately address these concerns. As an instructional method, writing has long been perceived {{as a way to}} improve critical thinking. In the current study, the researchers compared critical thinking performance of students who experienced a laboratory writing treatment with those who experienced traditional quiz-based laboratory in a general education biology course. The effects of writing were determined within the context of multiple covariables. Results indicated that the writing group significantly improved critical thinking skills whereas the nonwriting group did not. Specifically, analysis and inference skills increased significantly in the writing group but not the nonwriting group. Writing students also showed greater gains in evaluation skills; however, these were not significant. In addition to writing, prior critical thinking skill and instructor significantly affected critical thinking performance, whereas other covariables such as gender, ethnicity, and age were not significant. With improved critical thinking skill, general education biology students will be better prepared to solve problems as engaged and productive citizens...|$|R

And why do start-ups take on debt rather than rely exclusively on equity investments from angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs), as well-known capital structure theories from corporate finance would seem to predict in this context? Using hand-collected interview data and theoretical contributions from finance, economics, and law, this Article solves the puzzle of venture debt by revealing that a start-up’s VC backing and intellectual property substitute for traditional loan repayment criteria and make venture debt attractive to a specialized set of lenders. On the firm side, venture debt helps entrepreneurs, angels, and VCs avoid dilution, improves VC internal rate of return, assists VCs in monitoring entrepreneurs, and follows from capital structure theories after the first round of VC funding...|$|R
