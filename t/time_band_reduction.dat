40|$|To {{present a}} time-efficient {{technique}} for <b>banding</b> <b>reduction</b> in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging using phase-cycled simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition with CAIPIRINHA (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration). The proposed technique exploits the inherent phase modulation of SMS imaging with CAIPIRINHA to acquire multiple phase-cycled images, {{which can be}} combined for efficient <b>banding</b> <b>reduction</b> within the same scan time of a single-band bSSFP scan. Bloch equation simulation, phantom and in vivo brain, abdominal and cardiac imaging experiments were performed on healthy volunteers at 3 T using multi-channel head and body array coils with SMS acceleration factors of two to four. The performance of <b>banding</b> <b>reduction</b> was quantitatively evaluated based on the percent ripple of signal distribution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency in both phantom and human studies. The banding artifact was successfully removed or suppressed using phase-cycled SMS bSSFP imaging across SMS factors of two to four. The performance of <b>banding</b> <b>reduction</b> improved with higher SMS factors along with increased SNR efficiency. Phase-cycled SMS bSSFP with CAIPIRINHA is a promising technique for efficient <b>band</b> <b>reduction</b> in bSSFP without prolonged scan time. Further evaluation of this technique in clinical applications is warranted. Magn Reson Med 76 : 1764 - 1774, 2016. © 2015 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} spectral characterization for efficient image detection using hyperspectral processing techniques. We {{investigate the}} relationship between the number of used bands and the performance of the detection process in order to find the optimal number of <b>band</b> <b>reductions.</b> The <b>band</b> <b>reduction</b> significantly reduces computation and implementation complexity of the algorithms. Specifically, we define and characterize the contribution coefficient for each band. Based on the coefficients, we heuristically select the required minimum bands for the detection process. We have shown that the small number of bands is efficient for effective detection. The proposed algorithm is suitable for low-complexity and real-time applications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Timed {{specifications}} {{are often}} formalised at an absolute level of pre-cision, {{which does not}} reflect the real world that the specifications model, i. e., in the real world, inputs cannot be sampled with absolute precision and physical hard-ware cannot react instantaneously. As a result the developed specifications can often become unimplementable. In this paper, we consider the <b>time</b> <b>bands</b> model which allows time to be structured into several layers of abstraction and relationships be-tween bands to be formalised. This allows the timed specifications developed under idealised assumptions to be approximated using the <b>time</b> <b>band</b> in which the variables are sampled. We implement the approximated specifications using teleo-reactive programs embedded with <b>time</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

HPC LectureWith the success of Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) in using the memory efficiently, the algorithms with vector operations (BLAS 2) {{have given way to}} algorithms with matrix operations (BLAS 3). In some cases, BLAS 3 based algorithms are successful even with the cost of doing additional floating point operations and using additional memory. In this talk, I will talk about two problems where algorithms with vector operations when combined with blocking can perform better than BLAS 3 based algorithms. <b>Band</b> <b>reduction</b> methods are mainly used in computing the eigen value decomposition and singular value decomposition of band matrices. In {{the first part of this}} talk, I will outline a blocking scheme for plane rotations. The blocked plane rotations when coupled with a pipelining scheme leads to fewer floating point operations and memory usage than the BLAS 3 based <b>band</b> <b>reduction</b> methods. The blocked method is also able to extract the same performance benefits from the cache as the BLAS 3 based methods leading to a faster <b>band</b> <b>reduction</b> method. I will also show how we can exploit the zeros while finding the eigen and singular vectors. In the second part of the talk, I will introduce a method for computing the bidiagonalization of a sparse upper triangular matrix R. In this method, we exploit the sparsity of R and use plane rotations to reduce it to the bidiagonal form. We choose the rotations to minimize the fill generated in R itself. I will show how to extend this method to use dynamic blocking and the pipelining scheme to arrive at an efficient R-bidiagonalization method for computing the sparse SVD...|$|R
