5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E

During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> got into card flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Though {{it was not}} <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> were built, castles could {{often be}} used as prisons. One such {{instance}} from the 14thcentury illustrates this aspect of Château de Chinon's history. Founded in the Holy Land as a crusading military order in the early 12thcentury, the Knights Templar had, by {{the close of the}} 13thcentury, gained swathes of lands in Europe, particularly France. King PhilipIV of France had the members of the order in his kingdom arrested, accusing them of heretical practices. The leaders of the order, including the Grand Master Jacques de Molay, were imprisoned at Château de Chinon, in the Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII one century earlier. Graffiti carved by the imprisoned knights can be seen {{on the walls of the}} tower. In August 1308, Pope Clement V sent three cardinals to hear the leaders' confessions. The outcome was that in 1312 the pope issued a bull, the Vox in excelso, suppressing the order and its property was given to the Knights Hospitaller. The leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, apart from Jacques de Molay and Geoffrey de Charney who were burnt at the stake.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} real property, mechanic's liens are purely {{statutory}} devices {{that exist in}} every state (although in California, as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to {{the economics of the}} construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely the right to sue on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.|$|E
