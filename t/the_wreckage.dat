5|$|In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of an Avenger {{was found}} off the Florida coast during {{the search for}} <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation {{archaeologist}} Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of}} the missing planes.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December 1961, {{an empty}} {{coaching}} stock train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with a freight train at Conington, Huntingdonshire. Locomotive No. 60078 Night Hawk was hauling a freight train that ran into <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> A third freight train then ran into <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1998, the TSB {{initiated}} a heavy lift operation {{to retrieve the}} major portion of <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> from the deep water before the expected winter storms began. By 21 October, an estimated 27% of <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> was recovered.|$|E

2500|$|The outer {{section of}} the left wing, {{outboard}} of the engine nacelle, was found about ¾mile (1.2km) from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> fracture surfaces on the inboard ends of the spars it was almost undamaged. The right wing was torn into three sections by {{the violence of the}} gyrations and struck the ground [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> right engine was torn away from the right wing and struck the ground about [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> It was slightly damaged by the fire. <b>The</b> main <b>wreckage</b> trail was about [...] long. In the gyrations of the aircraft after separation of the outer part of the left wing, other parts broke free and separated from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> Many small pieces of wreckage were found scattered over a wide area.|$|R
5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off {{in the direction of}} a nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near <b>the</b> <b>wreckage,</b> including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{charged with}} {{investigating}} the accident, examined <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> at Long Island MacArthur Airport. Reports from witnesses {{of the crash}} indicated the aircraft appeared {{to have made a}} normal takeoff and began climbing normally. But, moments later it began banking sharply to the right. Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found in <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{section of}} the left wing, {{outboard}} of the engine nacelle, was found about ¾ mile (1.2 km) from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> fracture surfaces on the inboard ends of the spars it was almost undamaged. The right wing was torn into three sections by {{the violence of the}} gyrations and struck the ground 150 yd from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> right engine was torn away from the right wing and struck the ground about 50 ft from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> It was slightly damaged by the fire. <b>The</b> main <b>wreckage</b> trail was about 100 yd long. In the gyrations of the aircraft after separation of the outer part of the left wing, other parts broke free and separated from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> Many small pieces of wreckage were found scattered over a wide area.|$|R
50|$|The Peruvian Navy {{collected}} <b>the</b> floating <b>wreckage.</b> After <b>the</b> Peruvian authorities {{asked for}} assistance, the United States Navy provided equipment to locate <b>the</b> underwater <b>wreckage</b> and black boxes of the Boeing 757.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> main <b>wreckage</b> {{consisting}} of <b>the</b> fuselage, right inner wing, and left inner wing still with its engine attached, struck the ground inverted {{and was immediately}} consumed by fire. The bodies of the eight passengers were found in {{what remained of the}} cabin but were burned beyond recognition. The violent gyration of the fuselage threw the two pilots through the roof of the cockpit. Their bodies were found unburned [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> tail of the aircraft broke away from the fuselage and fell to the ground about [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage,</b> but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E

5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice {{recorder}} was recovered from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and the data recorded found to be intact and usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required {{for this type of}} flight and one had not been installed.|$|E

5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien wreckage. Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute and her work earned her enough recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations of dataDyne, setting the stage for the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E

50|$|Pieces of <b>the</b> {{airplane}} <b>wreckage</b> {{were discovered}} floating on {{and beneath the}} surface of the Atlantic Ocean about eight miles south of East Moriches, New York. <b>The</b> main <b>wreckage</b> was found scattered on the ocean floor in an area about 4 miles long by 3 1/2 miles wide. In one of the largest diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, over 95 percent of <b>the</b> airplane <b>wreckage</b> was eventually recovered. Recovered wreckage was transported by boat to shore and then by truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York, for storage, examination, and reconstruction.|$|R
