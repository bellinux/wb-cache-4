5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

40|$|Correlations {{between the}} returns of US stocks and {{international}} stocks were higher recently {{than in the}} past, reaching 0. 86 during the 60 months ending in December 2003. Todayâ€™s investors note the high correlations between US and international stocks and doubt <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of global diversification. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of global diversification remain high and that the correlation between US and international stocks is a misleading measure of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of global diversification. This is for two reasons. First, <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of global diversification depend {{not only on the}} correlation between the returns of US and international stocks but also on the standard deviations of these returns. Second, we tend to have poor intuition about the link between correlation and <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of diversification. A 0. 86 correlation seems high enough to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of diversification, but even correlations much higher than 0. 86 are associated with substantial benefits. Dispersion of returns is a better measure of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of diversification because it accounts for the effects of both correlation and standard deviation and because it provides an intuitive measure of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of diversification. We present the relationship between correlation, standard deviation, and dispersion. Anyone following the news cannot escape the impression that correlations among global stock returns are higher now than in the past. Rallies in U...|$|R
