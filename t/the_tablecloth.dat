5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
25|$|A {{carpenter}} (Leif Larsson) has a {{dream in}} which he is condemned and executed for breaking a 200-year-old china set while trying to perform <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> trick.|$|E
25|$|Pluto: pet of the Croatian operatic soprano Ilma de Murska, {{which used}} to dine at table with her and was trained to eat a cooked fowl from a place setting without {{dripping}} gravy on <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth.</b> Pluto lived in the 1860s.|$|E
60|$|Such was Abner Langworthy, the proprietor, as {{he moved}} leisurely down towards the lady guest, who was nearest, and who was sitting {{with her back to}} the passage between the tables. Stopping, occasionally, to professionally adjust <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths</b> and glasses, he at last reached her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you've {{done all}} your own mending, there's {{a heap of}} socks to be looked over. Then I'll show you about darning <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths.</b> I do hate to have a stitch of work left over till Monday," [...] said Mrs. Grant, who never took naps, and prided herself on sitting down to her needle at 3 P.M. every day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, my lady. Puddick's did send a {{great many}} things;--a whole waggon load there was come from the station. But <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths</b> ain't, none of 'em, {{long enough for the}} big table." [...] The Duchess's face fell. [...] "Of course there must be two. On them very long tables, my lady, there always is two." ...|$|R
25|$|St. Valentine's Chapel, {{above the}} Chapel of the Cross, {{is the current}} {{depository}} {{of the hundreds of}} relics belonging to the Stephansdom, including a piece of <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> from the Last Supper. A large chest holds the bones of St. Valentine that were moved here about a century ago, from what is now the Chapter House to the south of the High Altar.|$|E
25|$|The bar {{is packed}} with students, artists and flower girls, singing and dancing. Magda enters and attracts the {{attention}} of several young men. She hurries over to a table at which Ruggero is sitting alone. She apologizes for intruding and tells him that she will move away {{as soon as the}} young men at the bar stop watching her. Ruggero, who does not recognize Magda in her disguise, asks her to stay. They chat and Ruggero tells Magda that she reminds him of the quiet and elegant girls from his home town, Montauban. They dance happily together. Prunier and Lisette enter, arguing about Prunier's desire to turn Lisette into a lady and to educate her. Magda and Ruggero return to their table and Magda begins to reminisce about a past love affair. Ruggero asks for her name and she answers 'Pauletta'. She writes the name on <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> and Ruggero adds his own beneath. The attraction between Magda and Ruggero grows as they talk. Lisette and Prunier pass their table and Lisette recognizes Magda. Magda signals to Prunier not to give away her secret and Prunier tells Lisette she is mistaken. To prove his point, he introduces Lisette to Magda, who tries to maintain her disguise, to the puzzlement of Lisette. The two couples sit together and drink a toast to love. Prunier notices that Rambaldo has come in, and orders Lisette to take Ruggero out of the room for a few minutes, which she does. Rambaldo demands an explanation from Magda for her behaviour and disguise; she tells him that she has nothing to add to what he has already seen. Rambaldo suggests they leave together but she refuses and declares her love for Ruggero, apologizing for any pain she is causing Rambaldo by her actions. Rambaldo tells her that he cannot prevent her staying with Ruggero. As he leaves, Ruggero returns, and tells Magda that dawn is breaking. They decide to begin a new life together, but Magda secretly worries that she is deceiving Ruggero.|$|E
500|$|The book's third {{paragraph}} {{contains a}} long {{description of the}} process and purpose behind the ritual in gambling houses whereby [...] "the law despoils you of your hat at the outset." [...] The atmosphere of the establishment is described in precise detail, from the faces of the players to the [...] "greasy" [...] wallpaper and <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> [...] "worn by the friction of gold". The emphasis on money evoked in the first pages– and its contrast with the decrepit surroundings– mirrors the novel's themes of social organization and economic materialism.|$|E
50|$|Lemmen was {{a friend}} of the Serruys family. His growing {{interest}} in the arts and crafts movement {{can be seen in the}} attention he paid to <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth's</b> pattern and money plant's twining tendrils. At the time of this portrait, he was still adhering quite closely to the rigors of Neo-Impressionism, though he would later shift to looser brushwork and division of color.|$|R
60|$|Harrington's {{blue eyes}} were steady, but under <b>the</b> {{overhanging}} <b>tablecloth</b> a Smith & Wesson balanced on his knee. Madeline looked up, casually, with little interest.|$|R
60|$|I dined at what Herbert and I {{used to call}} a {{geographical}} chop-house, where there were maps {{of the world in}} porter-pot rims on every half-yard of <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths,</b> and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.|$|R
500|$|Potter sent {{miniature}} {{letters to}} the Moore children, to the Warne children, Lucie Carr and her older sister Kathleen, Master Drew Fayle, and to Master John and Miss Margaret Hough. Seven letters about Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle are extant. Mrs. Josephine Rabbit writes to complain of starch in her handkerchiefs, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle responds with apologies, Mrs. Rabbit then writes to compliment Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle on the [...] "getting up of the children's muslin frocks" [...] and promises not to seek another laundress. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle writes Master Fayle warning him that [...] "verything has got all mixed up in wrong bundles" [...] and wondering if he has received Mr. Jeremy Fisher's shirt or Mrs. Flopsy Bunny's apron? Mrs. Bunny writes Master Drew that she is looking for her apron. She has received a shirt marked J.F. that is 3-inches long. Jeremy writes twice to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Once, to complain that he has received an apron marked F.B. and then to complain in a letter dated January 22, 1910:Mr. J. Fisher regrets to have to complain again about the washing. Mrs. T. Winkle has sent home an enormous handkerchief marked 'D. Fayle' instead of <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> marked J.F. If this continues every week, Mr. J. Fisher {{will have to get}} married, so as to have the washing done at home.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E
2500|$|Meetings {{were held}} every Saturday between November and June. All members were {{required}} to wear the society's uniform – a blue coat and buff waistcoat with brass buttons. The buttons bore a gridiron motif and the words [...] "Beef and liberty". The steaks were served on hot pewter plates, with onions and baked potatoes, and were accompanied by port or porter. The only second course offered was toasted cheese. After dinner, <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> was removed, the cook collected the money, {{and the rest of}} the evening was given up to noisy revelry.|$|E
50|$|Over three decades, though {{hundreds}} of fabric designs, the Steigers created a vocabulary of graphic fabric patterning that {{became part of}} southern Arizona style. Their work offered a functional modernist interpretation of the Southwest. Although the studio closed in the 1980s after Sophie’s death, their influence is still present, not just in <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths,</b> curtains, dresses, and upholstery that sprinkle the interiors of houses throughout Tucson, but in a rich sophisticated style that continues to express the vision of post World War II southern Arizona. The Steiger silkscreens {{are now part of}} the permanent collections of Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona and the American Textile History Museum in Lowell, Massachusetts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I tell you?" [...] snapped Mable, {{addressing}} the group. [...] "Mary Louise {{is always on}} the wrong side. Other schools are not criterions for this ramshackle establishment, anyhow. We have twelve boarders and four day scholars, and how Miss Stearne ever supports the place and herself on her income is an occult problem that the geometries can't solve. She pays little Miss Dandler, her assistant, the wages of an ordinary housemaid; the furniture is old and shabby and the classrooms gloomy; the food is more nourishing than feastful and <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths</b> are so patched and darned that it's a wonder they hold together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't say as I won't do it," [...] said Mrs. Pullet, [...] "for now Tom's so lucky, it's {{nothing but}} right his friends should look {{on him and}} help him. There's <b>the</b> <b>tablecloths</b> I bought at your sale, Bessy; it was nothing but good natur' o' me to buy 'em, for they've been lying in the chest ever since. But I'm {{not going to give}} Maggie any more o' my Indy muslin and things, if she's to go into service again, when she might stay and keep me company, and do my sewing for me, if she wasn't wanted at her brother's." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New York Times in September 2013, Kenneth Leedom, an {{assistant}} of Horowitz for five years before 1955, laid claim to having been in a closeted relationship with him as his lover, saying, [...] "We had a wonderful life together...He was a difficult man, to say the least. He had an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I've had thrown on the floor or in my lap. He'd pick up <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> and just pull it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot. But then he was calm and sweet. Very sweet, very lovable. And he really adored me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mary Lou Williams, who mentored Monk and his contemporaries, {{spoke of}} Monk's rich {{inventiveness}} in this period, and how such invention was vital for musicians, since {{at the time}} it was common for fellow musicians to incorporate overheard musical ideas into their own works without giving due credit. [...] "So, the boppers worked out a music that was hard to steal. I'll say this for the 'leeches,' though: they tried. I've seen them in Minton's busily writing on their shirt cuffs or scribbling on <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth.</b> And even our own guys, I'm afraid, did not give Monk the credit he had coming. Why, they even stole his idea of the beret and bop glasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{shift of}} axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more {{completely}} in the picture, chair included, {{with the appearance of}} being nearer to us. His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane. Critics have described a [...] "deception of restraint" [...] in Cézanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, [...] "priming" [...] color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to [...] "liven" [...] the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth.</b> This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight Cézanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, The Card Players, was released as a four-color postage stamp by the French government in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a paid ransom several months later.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} figures {{drinking}} around a table, and {{the portrayal of}} a woman drinking from a glass are taken directly from De Hooch's A Dutch Courtyard. However, Vermeer's work breaks away from the prototypes of De Hooch in that the interior is rendered in a far more elegant and higher-class setting than the older master's works. The clothes of the figures, <b>the</b> patterned <b>tablecloth,</b> <b>the</b> gilded picture frame hanging on the back wall, and the coat of arms in the stained window glass all suggest a wealthier setting.|$|R
25|$|Of many memorable {{images from}} that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean {{of mud and}} sweat on <b>the</b> velvet <b>tablecloth</b> before shaking <b>the</b> hand of Queen Elizabeth II as she {{presented}} him with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup).|$|R
60|$|Meantime her father, chinking Mr Rokesmith's gold {{as he sat}} {{expectant}} {{between his}} knife and fork, remarked that six of those sovereigns came {{just in time for}} their landlord, and stood them in a little pile on <b>the</b> white <b>tablecloth</b> to look at.|$|R
2500|$|When Basilio {{starts to}} gossip about Cherubino's obvious {{attraction}} to the Countess, the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place (terzetto: [...] – [...] "What do I hear!"). He disparages the [...] "absent" [...] page's incessant flirting and describes how he caught him with Barbarina under the kitchen table. As he lifts the dress from the chair to illustrate how he lifted <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> to expose Cherubino, he finds ... the self same Cherubino! The count is furious, but is reminded that the page overheard the Count's advances on Susanna, something that the Count wants to keep from the Countess. The young man is ultimately saved from punishment by {{the entrance of the}} peasants of the Count's estate, a preemptive attempt by Figaro to commit the Count to a formal gesture symbolizing his promise that Susanna would enter into the marriage unsullied. The Count evades Figaro's plan by postponing the gesture. The Count says that he forgives Cherubino, but he dispatches him to his own regiment in Seville for army duty, effective immediately. Figaro gives Cherubino mocking advice about his new, harsh, military life from which all luxury, and especially women, will be totally excluded (aria: Non più andrai – [...] "No more [...] ").|$|E
6000|$|She {{released}} him and looked around. A lot of dirty dishes {{were on the}} table, <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth</b> was a [...] "sight to behold," [...] {{and so was the}} stove-kettle marks all over <b>the</b> <b>tablecloth,</b> splotches of pancake batter all over the stove.|$|E

5000|$|... “John Calder {{claims that}} Tynan {{commissioned}} it; but Ruby Cohn disputes this, saying that Samuel Beckett had recited {{it to her}} years before, and that Calder published a fair copy but not the original, which SB had written on <b>the</b> paper <b>tablecloth</b> of a café.” ...|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} door and led the way to a little drawing-room, which {{impressed}} Kipps as being smaller and less emphatically coloured than that of the Cootes, and in which at first only a copper bowl of white poppies upon <b>the</b> brown <b>tablecloth</b> caught his particular attention.|$|R
5000|$|For breakfast {{the next}} day, Alec {{produces}} <b>the</b> colourful <b>tablecloth</b> to cover <b>the</b> drab table. Alec asks if Tomás {{wants to go}} back to the orphanage.
