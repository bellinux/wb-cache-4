The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are painted {{to resemble the}} Wreck. These vehicles mimic <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One {{of the most famous}} instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
