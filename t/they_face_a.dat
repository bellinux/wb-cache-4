2500|$|Among African Americans, {{proximal}} stressors {{were described}} by early social psychological theorists. For example, Erving Goffman observed that racial minorities approach social interactions {{with a high}} degree of anxiety, because they have been discriminated against in the past. Similarly, Gordon Allport asserted that African American individuals display vigilance after exposure to prejudice, actively scanning the social environment for potential threats. [...] Such vigilance is presumed to be taxing, sapping emotional and cognitive energy from minority individuals and thus becoming stressful. [...] Proximal stressors also have been demonstrated among African Americans in terms of stereotype threat. Researchers have shown that, when African Americans are reminded of their racial minority status in an academic context, <b>they</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> high degree of anxiety, causing their intellectual performance to suffer.|$|E
