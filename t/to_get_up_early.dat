5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Ron Lieberman {{returned}} to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there. He believed she had stayed out late or all night, {{as she had been}} doing, and resolved to remind her the next time he saw her to call him under those circumstances. He went to bed as he had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> the next morning for work.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{attended}} the exclusive Scotch College in Perth for his entire primary {{and high school}} years. He was initially a self-taught swimmer, having observed his father in the water. He recalled that [...] "As I didn't like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early,</b> I didn't get swim instruction until my sixth grade at Scotch College". Evans later trained and competed for the school swimming team in summer {{as well as the}} field hockey team. Evans enjoyed success in all four strokes at school level, but was most proficient at breaststroke and chose to specialise in it, commenting that [...] "I'd rather be good at one stroke than mediocre in four". Thereafter, he was undefeated in breaststroke at school level. Evans learned the [...] "whip kick" [...] from Ian Dickson, brother of Olympic freestyle swimming medallist David Dickson. Evans later honed his endurance ability under Kevin Duff and his sprinting ability under Bernie Mulroy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think not, Peacocke. I rather think not. You'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>earlier</b> {{before you}} <b>get</b> {{the better of}} Robert Lefroy. You don't expect <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this money back again,--do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--nothing.... My, you'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> awful <b>early</b> Sunday morning if you'd {{like to go}} with me. My church {{starts at}} ten-thirty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You here, Crocker?" [...] {{said the}} author, fixing {{his eye on}} me. [...] "Deuced kind of you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> so <b>early</b> and carry a basket so far for me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Though Garfield {{can be very}} cynical, he {{does have}} a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, [...] "they say I have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early,</b> be nice to people, skip breakfast... I wish it would never end." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, Georges Seurat, {{known as}} George in the musical, is {{sketching}} studies for his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. He announces to the audience: [...] "White, a blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring {{order to the}} whole, through design, composition, tension, balance, light and harmony." [...] He conjures up the painting's setting, a small suburban park on an island, and retains some control of his surroundings as he draws them. His longtime mistress, Dot, models for him, despite her frustration at having <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> on a Sunday ("Sunday in the Park with George"). More park regulars begin to arrive: a quarrelsome Old Lady and her Nurse discuss how Paris is changing to accommodate a tower for the International Exposition, but the Nurse {{is more interested in}} a German coachman, Franz. The quiet of the park is interrupted by a group of rude bathers. George freezes them with a gesture, making them the subjects of his first painting, Bathers at Asni√®res. The setting abruptly changes to a gallery where the painting is on display. Jules (a more successful artist friend of George's) and his wife Yvonne think George's work has [...] "No Life." [...] Back on the island, Jules and Yvonne have a short discussion with George and depart. They take their coachman Franz with them, interrupting his rendezvous with the Nurse. Dot, who has grown tired of standing still in the early morning sunlight, leaves the park mollified after George promises {{to take her to the}} Follies. George approaches the Old Lady, revealed to be his mother, and asks to draw her, but she bluntly refuses.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. Quite, thank you. You must excuse us for {{not waiting}} for you. The country air tempted us <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We breakfast about {{a quarter}} to six, but I daresay you won't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> as <b>early</b> as that. You see, we have {{to set to work}} at six." ...|$|R
5000|$|Such {{recommendations}} may cast {{individuals with}} [...] different natural sleep patterns as lazy or unmotivated {{when it is}} a much different matter for {{a person with a}} [...] longer or [...] delayed sleep cycle <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>earlier</b> in the morning than for a person with an [...] advanced sleep cycle. In effect, the person accustomed to a later wake time is being asked not to wake <b>up</b> an hour <b>early</b> but 3 - 4 hours <b>early,</b> while waking <b>up</b> [...] "normally" [...] may already be an unrecognized challenge imposed by the environment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the incident, the Quebec government instigated several strategies to speed the recovery effort and to minimise the inconvenience of commuters. The Quebec government made it a priority to rescue survivors, remove {{the dead and the}} debris from Autoroute 19. The demolition work (of the Concorde Boulevard) closed Autoroute 19 for a little under four weeks [...] and caused [...] "motorists <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>earlier</b> and use special buses to commute into the city". These buses were shuttles provided to ferry commuters between new park and ride sites and subway stations.|$|R
60|$|Well, I {{will say}} this for myself, you'd want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> {{in the morning to}} catch me nappin'. I didn't catch your name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess it's always well <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> in the morning," [...] said Julius, {{before the}} lawyer {{had time to}} reply. [...] "We'll make tracks for the depot right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's all right. Gran'dad is slick. They'll hev <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> in the mornin' to {{beat him}} at his own game. But I wonder what he does with the {{counterfeit}} money, or the real money he trades it for." ...|$|E
50|$|In another flashback, Hershel asks Rick to {{lay down}} his gun and help him, {{encouraging}} him {{to spend some time}} without his revolver, and <b>to</b> start <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> in the morning so that he can join Beth (Emily Kinney) and Judith.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that you, Leonard?" [...] she said. [...] "I {{was dreaming}} that I {{was a girl}} again and at school at Durban, {{and that it was}} time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> for <b>early</b> service at the church. Oh! I {{remember}} now. Is it dawn yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one thing, Harriet," [...] said Mr. Archibald, [...] "which I {{wish you}} would speak to Margery about. I don't want her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> so <b>early</b> and {{go out for a}} morning walk. I find that those young men are also early risers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you care}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> enough to-morrow I'll show you. I have to milk, you see. Half of 'em have beads and things round their necks. You {{must be careful}} not to take 'em off; in case the mothers turn up." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> in {{the morning}} to practise, but he had to give that plan up, because of his sister. She was {{somewhat}} religiously inclined, and she said it seemed such an awful thing to begin the day like that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you care}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> enough to-morrow I'll show you. I have to milk, you see; and, by the way, half of em have beads and things round their necks. You {{must be careful}} not to take 'em off, in case the mothers turn up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{matter is}} not to be {{discussed}} now," [...] said the old attorney. [...] "I understand that.

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>earlier.</b> The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|R
30|$|In {{wishing for}} changes in schooling, {{students}} indicate that they care about their education {{and that they are}} seeking an education where they get value for their time and effort. At the moment, as with the school pizza, they feel they are getting ‚Äúripped off.‚Äù From their perspectives, they are being made <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> very <b>early</b> and do a lot of work, for little reward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, I'll {{put him to}} chasin' varmints {{with the}} hounds. An' say, son, this outfit is bad. You savvy--it's bad. You can't run that bunch.

60|$|They had a {{week before}} their {{families}} came. Each evening they planned <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay abed till the breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious {{that there were no}} efficient wives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as they dressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll find {{breakfast in}} the oven," [...] she said hurriedly. [...] "Jim ought to be up now. I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> for the washing.

25|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Beamont Secondary Technical School, Clark {{attended}} the Regional College of Art in Manchester at aged 16. Ossie had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> very <b>early</b> {{in the morning}} to make the long trip from home to college each day. Anne Clark would give Ossie prescribed pills to keep him awake and alert. This would be the start of a lifelong addiction to both prescribed and illegal drugs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wrote her}} we'd {{be there to}} breakfast, but not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> any <b>earlier</b> on that account," [...] replied Pat. His eyes danced.

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "He is all Wolf {{and nothing}} but Wolf.

6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early,</b> or {{to walk in}} the fields; and, if we mean to catch a fairy, we must be up and out by sunrise every fair morning till we get one. Can you do this, lazy Daisy?" [...] And Aunt Wee smiled to herself as if {{something}} pleased her very much.|$|E
60|$|Psmith had yielded up the key, but his {{inquiries}} {{as to why}} it {{was needed}} had been embarrassing. Mike's statement that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> and have a ride had been received by Psmith, with whom early rising was not a hobby, with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on the subject.|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} horrid, Valetta said, that Mysie should {{sleep in a}} {{different}} house; but almost as much of her company was vouchsafed on the ensuing day, Sunday, for Miss Elbury had relations at Rockquay, and was released for the entire day; and Fly was still so tired in the morning {{that she was not}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> in the day.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't reckon them {{times will}} ever come again. There {{never was a}} more bullier old ram than what he was.

5000|$|The ringers {{were paid}} for their efforts with food given to them {{at the start of}} autumn (fall): [...] "polenta, salame e vino rosso" [...] (polenta, salami and red wine). The ringing was quite onerous, on holy days they had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> very <b>early</b> for the Ave Maria, then play again for the {{principal}} mass, the afternoon and evening service and finally at night for the vespers. They eventually used to sell the food, receiving an amount of about current 130 euro per year.|$|R
5000|$|Amis's {{allocated}} supervisor was Lord David Cecil, {{who seemed}} disinclined to supervise anything at all; after a term {{and a half}} had passed without any contact between them, Kingsley decided to go in search of him at New College. This caused much amusement at the porters' lodge, {{as if he had}} asked for the Shah of Persia: 'Oh no, sir. Lord David?
