This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention. The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E

During normal election cycles, the elections must occur before {{the last two months}} of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the House of Representatives. The last round of presidential elections occurred in 2015. President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.|$|E
5|$|Section Four, {{which is}} divided into four chapters, {{outlines}} {{the functions of the}} Belarusian Government, mainly the President of the Republic of Belarus, the Council of Ministers, the Parliament of Belarus and the courts. Although elected by the Belarusian people, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> not be a member of a political party when he or she assumes office. The Constitution also lists official duties for various posts, such as the president being the commander-in-chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces. The section also describes procedures for situations where the president cannot continue duties or if the president dies in office.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunityâ€”the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if {{the president has been}} caught in the act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, {{absent from}} Singapore, or has been granted {{leave of absence}} from his duties, the {{functions}} conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President. In general, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.|$|E

5|$|The National Assembly makes legislation. The body {{consists}} of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet {{three times per}} year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), which holds a large majority.|$|E
5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> vice <b>president</b> <b>must</b> be a natural-born {{citizen of}} Colombia, at least 30 years of age. The Colombian Constitution of 1991 {{requires}} <b>the</b> vice <b>president</b> to meet <b>the</b> same eligibility requirements as <b>the</b> <b>president</b> {{that can be}} re-elected.

5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989â€“1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E
25|$|Once the Senate {{confirms}} a nomination, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> {{prepare and}} sign a commission, {{to which the}} Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed, before the new justice can take office.

5000|$|The Secretary of State (Secretario de Estado) in Argentina (federal government) {{is a high}} {{official}} with the same rank of a Minister, who is responsible directly to <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>The</b> position <b>must</b> be distinguished from a [...] "Secretary", a lower position, responsible to a Minister.|$|R
25|$|If at {{any time}} the office of Prime Minister is vacant, the President may wait a {{reasonable}} period {{to see if there}} is any other MP likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, and who may therefore be appointed Prime Minister. If there is no such person, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> dissolve Parliament by proclamation in the Gazette.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{early in the}} nation's history, up until the Jacksonian Era, many states {{appointed}} their electors {{by a vote of}} the state legislature, and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>must</b> still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Constitution {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>must</b> be inaugurated {{by taking the}} oath of office before Congress in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies.

Ahead of claims that the PRD would disrupt the precedings, the PAN took control of Congress's main floor three days before the inauguration was scheduled.|$|E
50|$|All missionaries {{serve in}} a mission under the {{direction}} of a mission president, who, like individual missionaries, is assigned by <b>the</b> LDS Church <b>president.</b> <b>The</b> mission <b>president</b> <b>must</b> be a married high priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood; his wife is asked to serve alongside him. In 2013 <b>the</b> mission <b>president's</b> wife was given additional leadership roles in <b>the</b> mission. Mission <b>presidents</b> are typically in their forties or older, and usually have the financial means to devote themselves full-time to the responsibility for three consecutive years. The church provides mission presidents with a minimal living allowance but it normally requires them to supplement it with their own funds. Often, <b>the</b> mission <b>president</b> <b>must</b> learn <b>the</b> local language spoken in the mission, as the missionaries do (although many mission presidents today have either previously served a mission in the mission language or speak the mission language as their native language).|$|R
