25|$|While not {{the fastest}} car all week, the #11 Castrol Holden VR Commodore {{was close to}} the front in most sessions, and the race looked like being a battle between Wayne Gardner, Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton and the Perkins car. At the start, a minor {{collision}} between Perkins and Lowndes saw the <b>tyre</b> <b>valve</b> from Perkins front right wheel torn off, resulting in the deflation of the tyre, and a slow lap back around to the pits. After replacing the tyre, and checking for other damage, Perkins roared down pit lane, trying to stay on the lead lap, a feat he accomplished.|$|E
2500|$|Räikkönen's {{start to}} the [...] season was less than perfect. The car was {{reported}} to be too soft on its Michelin tyres, with the result that it was not generating enough heat to post competitive qualifying times. The best qualifying position that a McLaren driver could manage in the first 3 races was 6th. Räikkönen compounded this by stalling on the grid of the first race of the season, the , and ending the race with just a point. He looked set for a podium in Malaysia until a faulty <b>tyre</b> <b>valve</b> failed and dropped him out of the points. Bahrain saw him achieve his first podium of the season with a third place behind Renault's Alonso and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli.|$|E

50|$|Other forest {{specifications}} {{include a}} high ground clearance, a forest cab, the TwinTrac reverse-drive system, narrow mudguards, protected <b>tyre</b> <b>valves</b> and factory-fitted forest tyres. With TwinTrac the seat, {{along with the}} armrest located cotrols can be turned through 180 degrees to meet {{a second set of}} foot pedals and a smaller steering wheel placed {{at the rear of the}} cab. This allows the operator to drive the tractor backwards and use rear mounted implements more efficiently. Only Fendt has provided a similar fully integrated reverse-drive system, while in other brands such devices have been post-manufacture, third party additions. Valtra is the only tractor manufacturer in the world that offers a factory-fitted reverse-drive system, which is ideal not only for forest work, but also for mowing and municipal maintenance tasks.|$|R
