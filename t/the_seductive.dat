5|$|Early {{research}} {{showed that}} adding seductive details {{did not have}} the intended effect of improving learning; instead <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details tended to be detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details better than the main text.|$|E
5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>seductive</b> details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, {{looked at}} readers' ability {{to monitor their}} own comprehension. Their study used a science text as {{the base of a}} lesson and {{decorative}} images as <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details. They found that readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, through <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> gaze of Adam, {{the left}} panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E

5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his torso and buttocks. Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in his left hand and the trishula (trident) in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E

25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with Rendez-vous (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in an accident, or possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle for exploring the violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life to spin off in unexpected directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E

25|$|In this section, Rousseau expresses {{his belief}} that actors and actresses {{themselves}} are people of an undesirable lifestyle and potentially weak moral foundation. Rousseau describes them as scandalous, hedonistic, and compares them to jesters, who were more blatantly indecent and obscene. Once again looking to Greece and Rome as an ideal, he says that Sparta did not tolerate theatres, and Rome considered the acting profession dishonourable. He writes that the actor is someone who is artificial, performs for money, subjects himself to disgrace, and abandons {{his role as a}} man. Though the actor is not necessarily malevolent with his talents of deception, Rousseau goes on, <b>the</b> <b>seductive,</b> manipulative nature of acting could potentially be used by actors to do harm in society outside of the theatre. It is also problematic, according to Rousseau for women and men to be working together as actors and actresses. Because of the natural respect men have for the moral sense and timidity of women, for men to be amongst women as actresses will be a further threat to men's morality.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to <b>the</b> <b>seductive</b> and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E
