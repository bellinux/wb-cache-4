The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could you possibly want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but <b>then</b> <b>smiled</b> and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) (...) was the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's {{favorite}} cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke {{one day to}} {{the sounds}} of the Adhan, the Muslim daily call to prayer. Preparing to attend, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the sleeve of his prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He <b>then</b> <b>smiled</b> and gently stroked his beloved cat three times. While the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it {{does not appear to be}} attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said [...] "nothing changed".|$|E
