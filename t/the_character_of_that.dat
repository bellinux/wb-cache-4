5|$|The {{black swan}} (Cygnus atratus) is widely {{referenced}} in Australian culture, although <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> importance historically diverges between the prosaic in the East and the symbolic in West. The black swan is also of spiritual {{significance in the}} traditional histories of many Australian Aboriginal peoples across southern Australia. Metaphoric references to black swans have appeared in European culture since long before the real-life discovery of Cygnus atratus in Australia in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Rapoport, Leopold Zunz, {{and many}} others place the {{settlement}} in 876, believing the King Charles, mentioned in the sources as having induced the Kalonymides to emigrate to Germany, to have been Charles the Bald, who was in Italy in that year; Luzzatto and others think that it took place under Charlemagne, alleging that the desire to attract scholars to the empire was more in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> monarch; still others assign it to the reign of Otto II (973-983), whose life, according to the historian Thietmar von Merseburg, was saved in a battle with the Saracens by a Jew named Kalonymus. The following table, compiled from the accounts of Eleazar of Worms and Solomon Luria, gives the Italian and German heads of the family, which produced for nearly five centuries the most notable scholars of Germany and northern France, such as Samuel he-Hasid and his son Judah he-Hasid. Although {{all of them are}} mentioned as having been important scholars, the nature of the activity of only a few of them is known.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, Wu {{accepted}} an offer of a position as an associate research professor at Columbia. Communication with China was restored, and Wu received a letter from her family, but plans to visit China were disrupted by the Chinese Civil War, and the birth in 1947 of a son, Vincent Yuan (...) , who would grow up to become a physicist like his parents. In 1949, Yuan joined the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the family moved to Long Island. After the communists came to power in China that year, Wu's father wrote urging her not to return. Since her passport had been issued by the Kuomintang government, she found it difficult to travel abroad. This eventually led to her decision to take out US citizenship in 1954. She would remain at Columbia for the rest of her career. She became an associate professor in 1952, a full professor in 1958, and the Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973. Her students called her the Dragon Lady, after <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> name in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates.|$|E

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Thomas, {{joined by}} Justice Scalia, issued a {{strongly}} worded opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that if Michigan could not remain a prestigious institution and admit students under a race-neutral system, the [...] "Law School {{should be forced}} to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admissions system." [...] In Justice Thomas' opinion, there is no compelling state interest in Michigan maintaining an elite law school, because a number of states do not have law schools, let alone elite ones. [...] Moreover, Justice Thomas noted that in United States v. Virginia, , the Court required the Virginia Military Institute to radically reshape its admissions process and <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> institution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{administration}} of Lord North (1770–1782) tried {{to defeat the}} colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the American Declaration of Independence. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of {{the defeat of the}} Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism. Burke wrote: [...] "As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of <b>the</b> <b>Character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly".|$|E

50|$|The show bore heavy inspirations from a TV show Left Right Left and Snehal Pandey's <b>character</b> was on <b>the</b> {{same lines}} of Naina, where she portrays a strong willed, anti-social, {{aggressive}} and straight forward girl. And also having a similar mission {{to clear a}} family member's name from being a traitor. However, later, <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> sketch was changed to a far more sober and friendly girl.

50|$|Episode 14 of the anime series Martian Successor Nadesico {{causes a}} rather {{confusing}} {{link between the}} world of the show itself and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Gekigangar III, a popular anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of; the episode is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on Gekigangar <b>that</b> involves <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> show watching Nadesico (many of them being big fans of it themselves).

60|$|The {{last eight}} or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell's march was through seas of blood. The weapon mainly used was the bayonet, the {{fighting}} was desperate. The way was mile-stoned with detached strong buildings of stone, fortified, and heavily garrisoned, and these {{had to be taken}} by assault. Neither side asked for quarter, and neither gave it. At the Secundrabagh, where nearly two thousand of the enemy occupied a great stone house in a garden, the work of slaughter was continued until every man was killed. That is a sample of <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> devastating march.|$|E

There was something very touching in <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> gentle Scot. MacKenzie's enthusiasm was seldom very strong, but here was a man whom he would willingly have known; and he was strangely affected by the thought of his lonely death, and his grave {{in the midst of the}} Dark Continent he loved so well. On that, too, might have been written the epitaph which is on the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E
