25|$|The {{maritime}} prowess {{was recorded}} in a Borobudur bas relief of Borobudur ship, the 8th century wooden double outrigger vehicles of Maritime Southeast Asia. The function of an outrigger is to stabilise the ship. The single or double outrigger canoe is the typical feature of the seafaring Austronesians vessels and the most likely <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> used for the voyages and explorations across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Indian Ocean. The ships depicted at Borobudur most likely were the type of vessels used for inter-insular trades and naval campaigns by Sailendra and Srivijaya.|$|E

At first its use was confined to the western half of the English Channel, but as the Brixham men extended their range to the North Sea and Irish Sea it became the norm there too.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} medieval galley specification {{comes from}} an order of Charles I of Sicily, in 1275 AD. Overall length 39.30m, keel length 28.03m, depth 2.08m. Hull width 3.67m. Width between outriggers 4.45m. 108 oars, most 6.81m long, some 7.86m, 2 steering oars 6.03m long. Foremast and middle mast respectively heights 16.08m, 11.00m; circumference both 0.79m, yard lengths 26.72m, 17.29m. Overall deadweight tonnage approximately 80 metric tons. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> had two, later three, men on a bench, each working his own oar. This vessel had much longer oars than the Athenian trireme which were 4.41m & 4.66m long. This type of warship was called galia sottil.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{it is not}} the {{wrecking}} of {{the ship}} that is important, but {{the fact that we have}} access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel.</b> The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the Hunley, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (Hunley also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact); the Resurgam II, the first powered submarine; and Holland 5, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.|$|E

However, under the new 1745 Establishment the responsibility for preparing designs ("draughts") for all ships was given to the Surveyor of the Navy, with the Master Shipwrights now responsible only for constructing ships to those common Surveyor's designs for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

25|$|Intussusception {{was first}} {{observed}} in neonatal rats. In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> formation, the capillary wall extends into the lumen to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish {{a zone of}} contact. Second, the endothelial cell junctions are reorganized and the vessel bilayer is perforated to allow growth factors and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with pericytes and myofibroblasts. These cells begin laying collagen fibers into the core to provide an extracellular matrix for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception {{is important because it}} is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast {{increase in the number of}} capillaries without a corresponding increase in the number of endothelial cells. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich microvasculature with new cells every time a new vessel develops.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E

[...] This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> breakage may even be indirectly responsible for the development of some organ systems and the evolution of larger organisms, as without detachment and migration, large masses of tissue in the embryo would remain disconnected from the blood supply.
