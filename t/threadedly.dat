40|$|Apparatus for {{preloading}} {{a spring}} loaded threaded member is described. The apparatus is formed of three telescoping tubes. The innermost tube has means to prevent {{rotation of the}} threaded member. The middle tube is <b>threadedly</b> engaged with the threaded member and by axial movement applies a preload thereto. The outer tube engages a nut which may be rotated to retain the threaded member in axial position to maintain the preload...|$|E
40|$|A {{fastener}} {{system is}} provided for securing a component to supporting structure. The fastener system comprises {{a pair of}} cooperating fastener modules. The first module includes a first stationary member attached to the supporting structure and a first bolt member <b>threadedly</b> engaged with the first stationary member. The second module includes a second stationary member also attached to the supporting structure and a second bolt member <b>threadedly</b> engaged with the second stationary member. The second bolt member also extends freely through a longitudinal bore in the first bolt member. Head members on {{the first and second}} head members are mutually engaged for their unitary rotation and the first head member engages the component. When the head members are rotated in one direction, they are advanced toward the supporting structure thereby drawing the component toward the supporting structure. Rotation in the opposite direction is effective to cause the head members to retract from the supporting structure and thereby separate the component from the supporting structure. With this construction, upon fracture either of the first fastener means at a location away from the first head member or of the second fastener means at a location away from the second head member, upon rotation of the first head member in the one direction, the first head member nevertheless continues to advance toward the supporting structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{coupling}} device has a transversely arranged, open-end groove in a flange {{attached to a}} pipe end. The groove in the flange receives a circumferentially arranged locking flange element on the other coupling member and permits alignment of the bores of the coupling members when the locking flange element is in the open end groove. Upon alignment of the bores of the coupling members, a trigger member is activated to automatically release a spring biased tubular member {{in one of the}} coupling members. The tubular member has a conical end which is displaced into the other coupling member to lock the coupling members to one another. A tensioning nut is <b>threadedly</b> movable on a coupling member so as to be moved into tightening engagement with the other coupling member...|$|E
40|$|A {{slip joint}} {{connector}} for joining {{first and second}} structural elements together is presented. The connector has a first body member attachable to the first structural element and a second body member attachable to the second structural element. The first body member has a male protuberance including a conical portion and the second body member has a conical receptacle for cooperatively receiving the conical portion of the protuberance. The protuberance includes a bridging portion for spacing the conical portion from {{the remainder of the}} first body member and the second body member has a well communicating with the conical receptacle for receiving the bridging portion. The conical male portion internally carries a nut while the second body member may receive a bolt through the receptacle to be <b>threadedly</b> received by the nut to secure the first and second body members tightly together...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{mounting structure}} for a {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch having a coaxial imaging system. The electrode mounting structure includes a support having a central hub and {{a plurality of}} spokes which extend from the hub generally radially with respect to the axis of the torch into supporting engagement with the interior walls of the torch. The spaces between the spokes are optical passages for transmission of light to form the image. A tubular collet holder is <b>threadedly</b> engaged at its upper end to the hub and extends downwardly toward the open end of the torch. The collet holder has an inwardly tapering constriction near its lower end. An electrode-retaining, tubular collet is mounted within the collet holder and has a longitudinally split and tapered end seating against the tapered constriction. A spring seats against {{the upper end of the}} collet and forces the split end against the tapered constriction to wedge the split end radially inwardly to grip the electrode within the collet...|$|E
40|$|A space {{transport}} vehicle is disclosed as including a body which is arranged to be movably mounted on an elongated guide member disposed {{in outer space}} and driven therealong. A drive wheel is mounted on a drive shaft and arranged to be positioned in rolling engagement with the elongated guide carrying the vehicle. A brake member is arranged on the drive shaft for movement {{into and out of}} engagement with an adjacent surface of the drive wheel. An actuator is mounted on the body to be manually moved back and forth between spaced positions in an arc of movement. A ratchet-and-pawl mechanism is arranged to operate upon movements of the actuator in one direction between first and second positions for coupling the actuator to the drive wheel to incrementally rotate the wheel in one rotational direction and to operate upon movements of the actuator in the opposite direction for uncoupling the actuator from the wheel. The brake member is <b>threadedly</b> coupled to the drive shaft in order that the brake member will be operated only when the actuator is moved on beyond its first and second positions for shifting the brake member along the drive shaft and into frictional engagement with the adjacent surface on the drive wheel...|$|E
40|$|A quick-connect {{fastener}} of a relatively-simple straightforward {{design is}} arranged with a tubular body adapted {{to be engaged}} against an attachment fitting in coincidental alignment with an opening in that fitting. A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting. Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a rotatable actuator which is <b>threadedly</b> mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first coupling member is arranged on the rotatable actuator to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second coupling member on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first coupling member to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that attachment fitting. Upon expansion of the collet fingers, the biasing means impose a biasing force on the expander to releasably retain the fingers in their latching positions...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external tapered surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces. The annular compression ring is disposed within a tubular locking nut which <b>threadedly</b> couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between the tapered surfaces. The nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The threaded coupling to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between the tapered surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place. The clamped cannula provides a seamless joint connection to the pump pipe outlet where the clamping force is uniformly applied to the cannula because of self alignment of the tapered surfaces. The nut can be easily disconnected to replace the pump if necessary...|$|E
