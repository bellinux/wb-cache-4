5|$|Dodd wanted <b>the</b> <b>SEC</b> {{to limit}} the amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest.

Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6.

40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) {{conspicuous}} failures {{during the}} financial crisis of 2008 have led many to question the agency’s relevance in the modern financial era. Some commentators have called {{for the creation of}} new super-agencies to assume a substantial portion of <b>the</b> <b>SEC’s</b> duties. Others highlight enforcement failures and question the agency’s commitment to its investor protection mission. Despite its recent missteps and persistent calls for regulatory overhaul, <b>the</b> <b>SEC’s</b> future seems secure for now as President Obama’s reform proposals (the “Obama Plan”) as currentlyconceived preserve the agency’s independence. Although thus far the Obama Plan protects <b>the</b> <b>SEC’s</b> status as an independent agency, several aspects of the plan threaten the agency’s long-term prospects. The proposal to expand the executive branch’s role in oversight over financial institutions may represent the beginning of an incremental encroachment on <b>SEC</b> authority. Similarly, <b>the</b> proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency could absorb a portion of <b>the</b> <b>SEC’s</b> traditional investor protection role. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>SEC’s</b> survival depends on whether its leadership takes effective action to restore its credibility and regain the public trust in the years to come...|$|R
