500|$|The episode {{helped to}} {{elaborate}} the backstory of The Smoking Man, the series' chief antagonist. William B. Davis, {{the actor who}} played the character, later noted, [...] "As the story developed, we developed a relationship between Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's apparent father, and Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's mother; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> backfilling with an historical connection." [...] Carter explained that the episode {{was the start of}} the series' greater conspiracy: [...] "It's an interesting development because it really was the development of the conspiracy. The elements of the conspiracy were part of his development. But [...] back story, of course, intertwined with Mulder's." [...] Actor Chris Owens reprised his role as The Smoking Man; he had previously played him in the season's earlier episode [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man".|$|E

Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role. Green later said that she got along well with Trier, [...] "but <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> talking about nudity and sex and so on. It got a bit too far ... It was my dream to work with him, but it’s a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened. I’m sure I would have been trashed doing that film".|$|E

500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E

I spent time with her and got to know her, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we first came out we were metal. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview on August 30, 2013, with Shinoda and Aoki, Shinoda said that they began working on the song [...] "no less than a half a year ago".

2500|$|Following {{the closure}} of Sullivan-Bluth Studios in 1993, John Pomeroy, who {{notoriously}} resigned alongside Don Bluth during work on The Fox and the Hound in 1979, returned to his former employer, and was assigned as the supervising animator of John Smith. Describing Smith's development throughout production, Pomeroy stated, [...] "The first concepts looked like a real well-groomed adventurer. Kind of predictable. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> making him a little sloppier. We tried looks where he was sloppily dressed, or where he {{had a couple of}} days' growth of beard...At first, Smith carried a lot of guns and daggers, but eventually these were cut out. Each time the design got simpler, it got better." [...] Additionally, Pomeroy cited inspiration for John Smith from Errol Flynn and physical attributes of Gibson.|$|E

Mittal later said of his involvement, [...] "I never expected that this was going to be such a huge project. I thought it was just the supply of some steel, a thousand tonnes or so, and that would be it. But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> working with artists and I realised that the object was not just to supply steel but to complete the whole project.

It was later announced that she had won the competition and Sandé was offered a record deal.

Her parents later sent BBC Radio 1Xtra a CD of her songs and Ras Kwame played the songs on his [...] "Homegrown Sessions", and four artists that year were asked {{to do a show}} in Soho in the United States. She later met Shahid Khan, who has previously worked with Ms Dynamite and Bashy. Khan said [...] "When we started together it took the music to something completely original.
