50|$|Additionally, most kilns have {{temperature}} {{differences from}} top to bottom. The amount of difference depends {{on the design of}} the kiln, the age of the heating elements, the load distribution in the kiln, and the cone number to which the kiln is fired.

Cones should be used on the lower, middle and <b>top</b> <b>shelves</b> to determine how much difference exists during firing. This will aid in the way the kiln is loaded and fired to reduce the difference. Downdraft venting will also even out temperatures variance.|$|R

Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff <b>top</b> <b>shelf</b> margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{essence of}} nudging is {{to adapt the}} {{environment}} in which consumers make decisions to help them make better choices, without forcing certain outcomes upon them. To determine how consumers can effectively be guided to select healthier snacks, we examine the effect of manipulating the assortment structure and shelf layout of an impulse display including both healthy and unhealthy snacks near the checkout counter of a canteen. Methods Both a lab and field study applied a two-factor experimental design manipulating snack offerings both in an on-screen choice environment and a natural environment (hospital staff restaurant). Shelf arrangement (i. e. accessibility) was altered by putting healthy snacks at higher shelves versus lower shelves. Assortment structure (i. e. availability) was altered by offering an assortment that either included 25 % or 75 % healthy snacks. Participants in the lab study (n[*]=[*] 158) made a choice from a shelf display. A brief survey following snack selection asked participants to evaluate the assortment and their choice. The field experiment took place in a hospital canteen. Daily sales data were collected for a period of four weeks. On completion of the field study, employees (n[*]=[*] 92) filled out a questionnaire about all four displays and rated their attractiveness, healthiness and perceived freedom of choice. Results The lab study showed a higher probability of healthy snack choice when 75 % of the assortment consisted of healthy snacks compared to conditions with 25 % healthy snack assortments, even though choices were not rated less satisfying or more restrictive. Regarding shelf display location of healthy snacks, no significant differences were observed. There was also no significant shelf arrangement by assortment structure interactive effect. The field study replicated these findings, in that this assortment structure led to higher sales of healthy snacks. Sales of unhealthy and total snacks were not impacted by manipulations (no main or interaction effects). Employees preferred shelf displays including a larger healthy snack assortment located at <b>top</b> <b>shelves.</b> Employees also felt more freedom in choice when healthy snacks were displayed at <b>top</b> <b>shelves</b> compared to lower shelves. Conclusions Overall, results suggest that increasing the prominence of healthy snacks by enlarging their availability, while permitting access to unhealthy snacks, is a promising strategy to promote sales. These results point to the importance of nudging strategies to encourage healthier snack patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{sedimentary}} total {{organic carbon}} (TOC) content {{as a proxy for}} surface water export production was mapped on the shelf and on the upper continental slope of the Benguela upwelling system using 137 core <b>tops.</b> <b>Shelf</b> maxima in TOC can be correlated with maxima in surface water productivity. On the slope, high TOC contents are observed offshore from sites of strong modern upwelling. Estimates of modern TOC mass accumulation rates (MAR) show that approximately 85 % of the total is accumulating on the shelf. TOC MAR were calculated, mapped and budgeted for the Holocene and for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using 19 sediment cores from the continental slope. During the LGM, centres of deposition and production have migrated off-shore with respect to their Holocene positions. TOC accumulation on the continental slope was approximately 84 % higher during the LGM than during the Holocene, possibly reflecting enhanced productivity. The TOC distribution patterns and sediment echo-sounding data suggest that undercurrents strongly influence the sedimentation off Namibia. Winnowing and focusing result in great lateral heterogeneity of sedimentation rates and sediment properties. Individual cores therefore do not necessarily reflect general changes in export production. These results highlight the need for detailed regional studies based on a large number of sediment cores for highly heterogeneous high productivity areas in order to derive general statements on total fluxes...|$|R
