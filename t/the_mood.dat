5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> of the record, but <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> of the people who made it... <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

50|$|Second, <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> of bipolar {{disorder}} {{do not respond}} to changes in the environment, while <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> of BPD do respond to changes in the environment. That is, a positive event would not lift <b>the</b> depressed <b>mood</b> caused by {{bipolar disorder}}, but a positive event would potentially lift <b>the</b> depressed <b>mood</b> of someone with BPD. Similarly, an undesirable event would not dampen the euphoria caused by bipolar disorder, but an undesirable event would dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{indicative}} <b>mood</b> was <b>the</b> default <b>mood,</b> and, alongside <b>the</b> imperative, the oldest.

Stative verbs used their own, entirely different set of endings in <b>the</b> indicative <b>mood.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Sahajanand Swami was {{appointed}} successor to Ramanand Swami {{as the leader of}} the Uddhav Sampraday by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampraday henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> of majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacarya.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
