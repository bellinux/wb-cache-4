She was certainly a leader, and a pioneer.|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R

5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> draft-type Finnhorse family lines left, {{and only}} an {{estimated}} {{two or three}} hundred animals {{are known to be}} used as actual workhorses in the 21st century.

5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} {{limited by the}} fact that most lines funnel into the Transbay Tube and San Francisco.

5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
