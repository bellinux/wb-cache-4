5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, and in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken {{during and after the}} incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, or in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
50|$|A debt {{obligation}} is considered secured if creditors have recourse to specific collateral. Collateral may include claims on tax receipts (in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government), specific assets (in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company) or <b>a</b> home (in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consumer).

5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> annular eclipse) moves rapidly from {{west to east}} across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon {{is moving in the}} same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E

5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus.

5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II in 1939, SBC, {{like other}} Swiss banks, was the {{recipient}} of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping. Just prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, SBC made the timely decision to open an office in New York City. The office, located in the Equitable Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest client.|$|E
5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting {{the remainder of the}} pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E

5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E
5|$|To derive a URI from a URI reference, {{software}} converts the URI {{reference to}} absolute form by merging {{it with a}} base URI according to a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI reference as relative to the base URI, although in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> absolute reference, the base has no relevance. If the base URI includes a fragment identifier, it is ignored during the merging process. If a fragment identifier {{is present in the}} URI reference, it is preserved during the merging process.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
