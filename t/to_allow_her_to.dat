Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and tells Rachel that she now supports it, and hopes it isn't too late to be a bridesmaid.|$|E
50|$|Bird contested Cunningham {{again in}} the 2004 general election. Although she took a large early lead, {{she was unable to}} secure victory until Organ was {{eliminated}} and his preferences flowed overwhelmingly <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> win on the 10th count.|$|R

5|$|She {{was opened}} to the public on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1971. The date was significant, as Belfast was the first naval vessel to be saved for the nation since , Lord Nelson's {{flagship}} at the Battle of Trafalgar. Though no longer part of the Royal Navy, HMS Belfast was granted a special dispensation <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> continue to fly the White Ensign.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia {{and her team}} go to investigate. When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} machine has been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns to Liberty Island to obtain the devices <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E

5|$|Quinn advises Rachel {{to refuse}} Finn's {{marriage}} proposal {{and leave her}} past behind. Quinn has done so, {{and she has been}} accepted at Yale. Quinn asks <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the Cheerios, but Sue refuses. However, following Regionals, she changes her mind. Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and supports it. Rachel is reluctant to start the subsequent wedding without Quinn, and texts Quinn. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then {{at the peak of}} his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E
5|$|Though Olga {{repeatedly}} asked Tsar Nicholas II <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> divorce, {{her brother}} refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was {{for life and}} that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, Natasha Wulfert, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized {{along with the rest}} of society. Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.|$|E

5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4feet (1.2m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.|$|E
5|$|After the {{rejection}} of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 {{he was able to}} tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.|$|E
5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{arbitrate}} the growing {{dispute between the}} Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife {{in an attempt to}} gain access to the royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E

As Paul returns from packing his car, Felicia emerges from hiding and knocks him unconscious, binds him to a chair, and hooks him up to a poisoned IV drip.|$|R
60|$|This was a turning-point in our diver's career. The {{collar-bone}} was {{all right}} {{in the course of}} a month or two, but Mrs Baldwin positively refused <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> goodman <b>to</b> go under water again.|$|R
5|$|Formidables arrival allowed Rawlings {{to order}} Illustrious to the advance base in San Pedro Bay, in the Philippines, {{for a more}} {{thorough}} inspection. She arrived on 16 April and the examination by divers revealed that some of her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked. The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs, enough <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
50|$|Leg 10 was a non-elimination leg. The {{eliminated}} teams {{waited for}} another team, {{only to discover}} that the leg was non-elimination. Amber taught Mary how <b>to</b> swim, <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> overcome <b>her</b> long-held fear of swimming.|$|R
50|$|As {{a senior}} in 1947, Coleman's mother finally agreed <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> son <b>to</b> play football. In his first year of football, he was {{selected}} as an all-state guard and led Flint Central to the state championship.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a pause;--not that he {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> disobedience <b>to</b> pass, {{but that he was}} driven to bethink himself how he might best oppose her. 'Woman,' he said, 'you can neither forgive nor forget.' ...|$|R
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit {{a number of other}} cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E
5|$|Malawi competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, {{which was}} held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's {{participation}} at London marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes; Mike Tebulo and Ambwene Simukonda, and one swimmer; Joyce Tafatatha. Tebulo and Simukonda qualified through wildcard places for their respective events. Tebulo {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Tebulo finished 44th in the men's marathon, while Simukonda did not advance beyond {{the first round of the}} women's 400 metres. Tafatatha won her heat in the women's 50 metre freestyle but her time was not fast enough <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> progress into the semi-finals of the event.|$|E
5|$|Sinop was {{refitted}} in Nikolaev with torpedo bulges {{to serve}} as 'mine-bumpers' in 1916 <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lead other ships into the mined waters of the Bosphorus, but the operation was later cancelled. She was captured by the Germans in April 1918 in Sevastopol and was {{handed over to the}} Allies in November 1918. The British sabotaged her engines on 25 April 1919 as they abandoned the Whites to prevent any use by the advancing Bolsheviks. Sinop therefore remained at Sevastopol {{for the duration of the}} Russian Civil War, being captured by both sides as they occupied the city in turn, but was then abandoned by Wrangel's fleet when it evacuated the Crimea in 1920. Although Russian archives say that Sinop was gradually scrapped from 1922, an underwater expedition under the leadership of Robert Ballard found a wreck that has been tentatively identified as Sinop upside down off not far from Sevastopol.|$|E
50|$|Thunebro enjoys {{playing golf}} and rides a motorcycle. Throughout her career {{she did not}} employ an agent. Part of the reason she wore <b>her</b> {{trademark}} headband was <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> grandmother <b>to</b> easily identify <b>her</b> while watching on the television.|$|R
50|$|Michael {{eventually}} {{confesses to}} Maria {{exactly what she}} means to him and shows his vulnerable side <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see flashes of his tragic past, using his powers. The two spend the night {{for the first time}} before he tells her he must leave {{to go back to his}} home planet, Antar. Several minutes before he is about to leave, Michael realizes he has finally found home, says farewell to Max and Isabel and decides to stay on Earth with Maria.|$|R
25|$|On 21 July, the two frigates {{encountered}} a British convoy {{off the coast}} of New Scotland.
