40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) are a form {{of property}} rights that can solve the inefficiencies of open-access fisheries and generate a Paretooptimal market solution in a fishery. Some writers {{have pointed out that}} if there are some production externalities in the fishery, ITQs {{will not be able to}} generate a first-best solution. In this paper, it is argued that this is incorrect. It is proved that ITQs solve the production externalities associated with crowding, as well as the stock externality they are primarily designed to solve. In a more general setting, ITQs can form a basis for trade in the production externalities and generate a first-best solution. In this case, the contracts for <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> must include clauses that restrict further sales of quotas. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} fishing households under individual transferable quotas (ITQ) system based on Singh, Squire and Strauss household model. ITQ system is sought to be the optimal fishery management regime {{in terms of economic}} efficiency. However, preceding theoretical analyses only considered implementing ITQ to a well established fisheries industry, in which fishermen are mere producer or employee of the industry. They also implicitly assume that all markets are functioning perfectly. Fisheries in developing countries, with prevailing overexploitation, have a very different picture: fisherman is a producer and consumer of its own harvest, and most importantly there are market imperfection everywhere. Hence the question: Is ITQ still the first-best fishery management regime under such conditions? The paper first analyzes when all markets are perfect as a benchmark. It is shown that ITQ perform as predicted by the literature; the social optimum is achieved. Throughout this paper, markets for fish and quotas are assumed to be perfect. Next the paper {{analyzes the}} effect of missing labor market to illustrate the consequences of ITQ under market imperfection. It analytically shows that ITQ achieving social optimum is no longer guaranteed, and {{it may not be the}} first-best regime either. To demonstrate these points, numerical simulations were carried out. Simulations showed that under certain condition, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> could be reversed, i. e. from more efficient to less efficient fisherman. It also showed that transferability could do more harm than good in terms of social welfare...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we measure the quality change which has {{occurred}} in U. S. steel imports during the 1969 - 74 VRA, using an index number method. Under this approach, the yearly changes in unit values is broken into three components: a quality-adjusted or pure price index; a quality index, which measures changes in the product mix; and a supplier index, which measures changes in the source of supply. We also derive a measure of welfare cost, which equals the inverse of a Paasche price index minus the inverse of an exact price index. Over the 1969 - 74 VRA period we find quality upgrading of 7. 4 percent in U. S. steel imports, which occurs most strongly in the first year. The welfare cost of quality change varies around one percent of import expenditure during 1970 - 73.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of policy reforms such as the MTR of the CAP and WTO arrangements, many policy analysts are {{questioning}} the value of retaining the EU milk quota system {{in its current form}} and one policy reform option that has been discussed in advance of the 2008 Health Check of the CAP is the international <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rights between member states. A methodology for simulating a free market for milk quota is outlined in this paper with a view to extending the work to other member states to determine which member states would supply and demand milk quota if an international market for quotas was established. The analysis, conducted for Ireland, uses National Farm Survey data from 491 dairy farms to estimate the aggregate demand for and supply <b>of</b> milk <b>quota.</b> A profit maximization model is used to simulate the production decisions of farmers and aggregation techniques are applied to arrive at national and regional demand and supply curves. Two policy scenarios are analysed; one assumes that there is no WTO reform and that the policies agreed under the MTR of the CAP in 2003 continue indefinitely, the second scenario assumes that a WTO agreement is reached and that export subsidies are phased out. The analysis also considers the effect of the Single Farm Payment on the market for milk quota and a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the lifespan <b>of</b> the milk <b>quota.</b> The methodologies developed in this paper, offer policy makers in Ireland a useful tool to analyse the effect of imposing different constraints on the milk quota market, be they regional, volume based or some other measures. The analysis also offer some insight into the capitalisation of policy measures into asset values; this is evident from the substantially lower market equilibrium price for quotas in a scenario where there is no export subsidies relative to a continuation of these policies and also from the effect of re-investment of the Single Farm Payment on quota values. The approach adopted is sufficiently general to be applied to FADN data for the major dairy producing countries in Europe to determine where milk production may move to if there was an international free market for quota rights.

We integrate (1) a structural dynamic model of fishery participation with (2) indicators of community vulnerability and community participation in fishing. We vary the policy design and develop counterfactual scenarios predicting, over time, which fishermen will stay in the fishery, the quantity they fish and associated profitability, and the ports they will deliver to. We link these results to community participation indicators and examine the impact of policy design on vulnerable communities as well as the evolution of indices of community participation in the fisheries. This allows us to examine the potential for catch share design elements to meet non-economic objectives...|$|R

The main objective {{of the project was}} to identify milk quota transfer mechanisms that would ensure the viability of the maximum number of farmers in Ireland while still supporting an internationally competitive agricultural sector. During the course of the project the Irish Department of Agriculture introduced a new milk quota transfer scheme. The milk quota exchange scheme was launched in November 2006. At this stage the objectives of the project were altered to be more policy relevant. Rather than exploring the efficiency <b>of</b> various milk <b>quota</b> <b>transfer</b> models, the aim of the project was redirected to explore the efficiency of the scheme as it was operated in Ireland. The rationale for this change was to provide relevant and timely feedback to policy makers on the operation of the new scheme. While the MTR agreement guaranteed the continuation of the EU milk quota regime until 2014 / 15, it also made provisions for a review <b>of</b> the milk <b>quota</b> system to be conducted in 2008. Clearly any changes to EU milk quota policy would have implications for farmers in Ireland.

40|$|During {{the recent}} {{deliberation}} of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Controls, considerable attention {{was devoted to}} the question whether, regardless {{of the level of}} imports which should be allowed, the control should take the form <b>of</b> a <b>quota</b> or a tariff. Occasionally reference was made to a well-known equivalence theorem which holds that when there is perfect competition in the product market a tariff will generate a volume of imports which, if alternatively set as a quota, produces an identical discrepancy between foreign and domestic prices. Therefore, other than the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> revenues from <b>quota</b> holders to the treasury, there should be no difference between the two types of control. Nevertheless, some support for a quota persisted on the grounds that “A tariff can’t do anything to help the consumer. It will have the same effect in limiting imports as a quota, but all the money goes into the treasury. With quotas, on the other hand, there’s some chance of benefits trickling down to consumers in the form of lower prices. ” Since the market conditions and import regulations for oil differ somewhat from the textbook examples, it is worthwhile to consider whether, in this particular case, there is some reason for consumers to prefer quotas to an “equivalent” tariff. It will turn out that due to the peculiar nature <b>of</b> oil <b>quotas</b> which are set as a fraction of refinery output, such a proposition can be shown to be true under a very restrictive set of assumptions...|$|R
40|$|A Landing Obligation (LO), or a {{requirement}} to land all catches of certain fish species, was introduced {{as part of}} the EU’s new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2014. This DiscardLess policy brief focuses on initial experiences with LO implementation in the Baltic and Pelagic fisheries. It summarises the discard plans in these fisheries, presents stakeholder experiences from interviews, meeting attendance and literature review and highlights emerging issues relevant to all fisheries where the LO is being implemented. Background and main elements of the landing obligation. In March 2007, the Commission published a communication recognising the serious problem of discarding in European fisheries. A public consultation was held and discarding was subsequently highlighted in the Commission’s Green Paper on CFP reform. While a discard ban received significant support, industry recommended instead that discard reduction should be planned, on a fisheries basis, through creating incentives to enhance selectivity. An incident involving a UK trawler in Norwegian waters in 2008 generated public pressure to end discarding, which increased from August 2010 in response to a UK celebrity chef’s public campaign known as “Hugh’s Fish Fight”. In 2011 the Commission included an obligation to land catches of regulated species in its CFP reform proposal. The adopted CFP included a LO, which applied for Baltic and pelagic fisheries from January 2015. The main elements of the LO are as follows: Scope: The LO applies to all catches of species which are subjected to Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits or, in the Mediterranean, to a minimum landing size (MLS). Species that are not subject to TACs or MLS can still be discarded. Minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) : The LO requires that fish under the MCRS are landed but prohibits their use for direct human consumption. Catches of all fish, including fish below the MCRS must be recorded and counted against quotas. Exemptions: The LO does not apply to species and fisheries with demonstrably high survival rates for discarded fish. Also up to 5 % of the total catch of species may be discarded in cases where selectivity increases are difficult to achieve or where handling of unwanted catches creates disproportionate costs (de minimis exemptions). Discard plans: In the absence of multiannual plans groups of member states organised at a regional level develop discard plans in consultation with advisory councils. These plans are submitted as “joint recommendations”, which detail the species {{to be included in the}} LO, at which times and also any exemptions. Following review of the joint recommendations by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) the plans are adopted by the European Commission either in full or with amendments. Quota flexibility The LO requires that fishermen have access to quotas to cover their catches or they have to cease fishing (see “choke species problem” below). Accordingly, there are rules that allow for conditional <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> between years and between species...|$|R

Modifications included state-to-state <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> unused recreational <b>quota</b> and suspension <b>of</b> recreational seasonal closures for some states including Maryland. Fishing mortality (F) has remained below {{the target and}} spawning stock biomass (SSB) has remained at or below the target since 2010.

In the late 1980 s, the Atlantic coast summer flounder stock was overfished and depleted. A coastal Fishery Management Plan for Summer Flounder was developed in 1982 by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). This coastwide plan established a 14 ” minimum size and specified trawl net mesh size for fishing in state waters (≤ 3 miles from shore). The MAFMC developed a complementary Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery in 1988 to govern the federal waters (> 3 miles from shore).

50|$|Many IFQ systems {{involve the}} {{temporary}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> fishing rights, whereby the owner <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> leases the fishing rights to active fishermen {{in exchange for}} a fixed percentage of the landed value <b>of</b> fish. Since <b>quota</b> acquisition is often beyond the financial means of many fishermen, they are forced to sacrifice substantial portions of their income in order to lease fishing rights. For example, Bering Sea crab lease fees can be as high as 80% of the landed value of the crab, meaning that the active fishermen only retain 20% of the revenue, much of which is needed to cover costs. In some fisheries, the majority <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is leased to active fishermen, often by individuals who do not physically participate in the fishery, but have been able to acquire shares. This makes quota acquisition even less likely for active fishermen, results in diversion of wealth away from fishing communities and into the hands of private investors, and can cause major financial strain on fishermen along with the economic contraction of fishing communities.|$|R
