40|$|International {{tax reform}} cannot wait. In 1996 the Treasury Department {{rejected}} the formulary apportionment (FA) method for taxing multinational corporations. That {{was the right}} decision at the time; economic integration and multinational activity was not sufficiently advanced to justify abandoning the arm’s-length method. But developments since then reveal {{that it is time to}} reconsider that decision. The arm’s-length method reflects an era when companies delivered tangible goods, provided services in person, and conducted business through simple corporate structures. That era is long gone. Companies now deliver goods and services electronically, conduct cross-border operations via an intangible economic presence, and operate through complex, often hybrid corporate structures. Unfortunately, the arm’s-length method ignores those realities. It requires that multinational enterprises have a permanent establishment to be subject to tax in a country. It requires them to calculate their profits as if their integrated operations were separate and distinct from each other and to price every internal transfer of goods and services under the fiction that those transfers occurred with unrelated parties at market prices. It allows them to shift income to low-tax countries and expenses to high-tax countries with a keystroke. The United States can no longer afford to ignore those realities.

40|$|Researchers, {{activists and}} analysts {{concerned}} about gender equity have not paid sufficient {{attention to the}} taxation system {{and the manner in}} which taxes and tax policies may impact on the gendered nature of economic and social life. Similarly, <b>tax</b> <b>analysts</b> and policymakers have not paid attention to how tax policies and tax reforms may interact with gendered social norms. Yet, around the world, there are concerns that tax systems are biased against women, and that contemporary tax reforms may increase the incidence of taxation on the poorest women while failing to generate enough revenue to fund the programmes needed to improve these women’s lives. Drawing on a three-year eight-country study Taxation and Gender Equity outlines why gender equity advocates need to interrogate the revenue side of public finances, and why <b>tax</b> <b>analysts</b> and policymakers should carefully consider the gender impacts of tax policies and tax reforms. This book develops a conceptual framework and methodology for examining and evaluating the impacts of direct and indirect taxation on different types of households, based on sex composition and employment status; presents the results of the in-country and cross-country research; and suggests a set of principles and guidelines for gender-equity enhancing tax policies and tax reforms in developing and developed countries. This is the first book to systematically examine gender and taxation within and across countries at different levels of development. It presents original research on the gender equity dimensions of personal income taxes, value-added taxes, excise taxes, and fuel taxes in Argentina, Ghana, India...|$|R

A large amount of the claimed $19.3 billion also comes from the phase-out of the federal estate tax, which was enacted {{by an act of}} Congress and not by the Florida state government. Economist Martin Sullivan, in a report for <b>Tax</b> <b>Analysts,</b> concluded that <b>tax</b> cuts in Florida totaled $13 billion during the eight-year Bush era; Sullivan's figure is not adjusted for inflation and excludes the estate tax (because it required no legislative action to go into effect).

Now, most assume that even under optimistic scenarios revenues will fall in constant-dollar terms.
