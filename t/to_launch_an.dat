5|$|On 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, {{which called}} for the Kursk {{offensive}} operation, codenamed Zitadelle ("Citadel"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by Kurt Zeitzler, the OKH Chief of Staff. For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets {{had a chance to}} prepare extensive defences or <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>an</b> offensive of their own. Some military historians have described the operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, the RUF {{blocked the}} road {{connecting}} Freetown to Lungi Airport, prompting UNAMSIL staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel {{in preparation for}} a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards Freetown. In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to Dakar, Senegal, to decrease the time required <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>an</b> operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>an</b> evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one who attacked.

Beornwulf's motivation <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>an</b> attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
