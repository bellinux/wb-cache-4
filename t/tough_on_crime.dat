5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime.</b> Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E

25|$|Yale Law Professor, and {{opponent}} of mass incarceration James Forman Jr. has countered that 1) African Americans, {{as represented by}} such cities as the District of Columbia, have generally supported <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> policies. 2) There {{appears to be a}} connection between drugs and violent crimes, the discussion of which, he says, New Jim Crow theorists have avoided. 3) New theorists have overlooked class as a factor in incarceration. Blacks with advanced degrees have fewer convictions. Blacks without advanced education have more.|$|E

25|$|Being <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> {{was a major}} plank of Pataki's {{campaign}} for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 11 years Pataki had served as governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous {{state in the nation}} to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York’s criminal statutes. In 1995, Governor Pataki was able to uphold a campaign promise by reinstating capital punishment in New York with the Sentencing Reform Act. The reinstatement of the death penalty was later suspended by the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) in a 4–3 decision. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest gun control laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but had never made it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it in a bipartisan effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of Megan's Law and Kendra's Law were integrated into New York's laws under the governor {{as well as a number}} of reforms to the Rockefeller Drug Laws. The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates' ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the course}} of this dispute, the {{association}} printed full-page advertisements in the Toronto Star and Toronto Sun asking the mayor to become personally involved through his role as a board member. [...] It also issued an open letter which asked if Miller wanted to be remembered [...] "as the mayor who was <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime,</b> or the mayor who was tough on cops". [...] On October 31, Miller informed the media that he was working to bring both sides together. [...] A tentative deal was signed in early November, with reports that board had compromised on retention pay. [...] One published report suggests that Ralph Lean, a leading Miller fundraiser, played an instrumental role in ending the dispute through private negotiations with former Association head Craig Bromell.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{promised to}} be <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> by imposing tougher sentences to people committing firearm offenses and violent crimes; a promise made by Harper after {{a record number of}} deaths by gun-related incidents in Toronto in 2005. They are also on the process of creating a new law that would impose tougher sentences for repeat crime offenders, eliminating house arrest or conditional sentences of offenders and a legislation targeting impaired drivers and street racing. Several anti-crime bills were progressing in the House but failed to pass the Senate as a new Throne Speech was announced for October 2007 in which several of the measures were re-announced. The new bill, called the Tackling Violent Crime Act (or Bill C-2), consisted of five bills many of them from cancelled legislations and included measures the age of consent, repeat and violent offenders. A confidence motion on the bill was tabled and passed the House 172-27 on February 12, 2008 as all Liberal MPs abstained from voting. The motion is set to presented at the Senate in March 2008 ...|$|E

50|$|In 1993, stricter {{rules were}} {{implemented}} in the Swedish prison system. Among the changes, the possibility for early parole was abolished. In accordance with a <b>tougher</b> view <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> in Swedish society, more persons received prison sentences and the sentences also got longer. This increased {{the pressure on the}} prison system and created a tougher environment in Swedish prisons, especially inside the larger security prisons like Kumla, Hall and Tidaholm.|$|R
40|$|Due {{process of}} law has become a {{casualty}} of the war <b>on</b> <b>crime.</b> As representatives of both parties compete to show which is the <b>toughest</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime,</b> the criminal justice systems in the United States have become so result-oriented that little {{attention is paid to}} the fairness and reliability of the process which leads to those results. In the quest to obtain more convictions and death sentences, little concern is being shown for the likelihood of error and the need to provide equal justice for persons of color and the poor. Yet the criminal justice systems are making {{some of the most important}} governmental decisions in society—who will lose their liberty and for how long, and who will be put to death. The operation of the criminal justice system is particularly important to the African-American community. One third of African-American men between the ages of 18 and 30 are under some type of court supervision and by the turn of the century one half of all black men will be in prison or jail, or on probation or parole...|$|R

40|$|If {{the thought}} of one {{election}} campaign is your worst nightmare, then pity the West Australians. When Julia Gillard announced a September federal election it meant two campaigns being run simultaneously in the country’s largest state. It’s Labor versus the Liberals and Nationals, of course, so the names remain the same. But {{that may be the}} problem. It’s never been that easy to separate state and federal election issues and it’s {{going to get a lot}} harder for West Australians. There are some clear “state” issues like whether Colin Barnett’s Liberal government will be <b>tougher</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> than Mark McGowan’s Labor claims it will be. Law and order is “bread and butter” in a state election campaign. And states' rights isn’t something that will play out at a federal level, though Tony Abbott may express some level of support for a devolution of power from Canberra, a move that would aid his state Liberal colleague in Barnett given the level of dissatisfaction in WA with how GST revenue is distributed by Canberra...|$|R

50|$|Wilson {{was known}} as a fiscal {{conservative}} who supported Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as <b>tougher</b> <b>on</b> <b>crime</b> than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was one of his home state's U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson won by a wide margin.|$|R
