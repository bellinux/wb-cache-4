5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Kefalas {{was named}} to seats on the House Appropriations Committee, the House Finance Committee, and the House Health and Human Services Committee. Kefalas has named health care reform as his top priority and plans on introducing legislation to create a single-payer universal {{health care system in}} Colorado during the 2009 session. The bill was introduced as a proposal to create a 23-member commission to make recommendations as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> implement a single-payer system, and was reported favorably out of a House committee. However, Kefalas was one vote short of the 33 necessary to pass the legislation out of the house, and in April, asked that the legislation be killed.|$|E

Soon after, they find themselves many years in the past by the actions of a stranger, and are able to retrieve the wand there.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E

5|$|Elections in 1936 were {{won by a}} {{grouping}} of left-wing parties united as the Popular Front. The right began to conspire as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it. The government was weak, and Azaña led a minority government. Pacification and reconciliation {{would have been a}} huge task. Acts of violence and reprisals spiralled. In April, parliament replaced Zamora with Azaña as president. However, Azaña was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, Casares Quiroga, was weak. This was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil-Robles as the right's leading spokesman in Parliament. Prieto did his best to avoid revolution, promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including parts of the military and civil guard. Communists quickly took over the ranks of socialist organisations, scaring the middle classes. Several generals decided that the government had to be replaced if the dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. They held professional politicians in contempt.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold eagle. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the USS Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.|$|E

5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{treat the}} wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At {{the end of}} the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and the {{issue of whether or not}} to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E
