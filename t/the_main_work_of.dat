The naming of species with binomials and the organization of birds into groups based on their similarities became <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> museum specialists.

Her sympathies throughout were with the Christian Democratic government of Giuseppe Pella, and she was influential on the Mediterranean policy of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, another anticommunist. Although Luce regarded the abatement of the acute phase of the crisis in December 1953 as a triumph for herself, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> settlement, finalized in October 1954, was undertaken by professional representatives of the five concerned powers (Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Yugoslavia) meeting in London.|$|E

[...] There were other objectives, both scientific and geographical; the scientific work was considered by chief scientist Wilson as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the expedition: [...] "No one can say {{that it will have}} only been a Pole-hunt... We want the scientific work to make the bagging of the Pole merely an item in the results." [...] Wilson hoped to continue investigations, begun during the Discovery expedition, of the penguin colony at Cape Crozier, and to fulfil a programme of geological, magnetic and meteorology studies on an [...] "unprecedented" [...] scale. There were further plans to explore King EdwardVII Land, a venture described by Campbell, who was to lead it, as [...] "the thing of the whole expedition", and Victoria Land.|$|E

Aruch HaShulchan, by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein, is a more analytical work attempting the same task from a different angle, and covering all sections of the Shulchan Aruch. The former, though narrower in scope, enjoys much wider popularity and is considered authoritative by many adherents of Orthodox Judaism, especially among those typically associated with Ashkenazic yeshivas. The Ben Ish Chai, Kaf Ha'Chaim, and much more recently, the Yalkut Yosef are similar works by Sephardic Rabbis for their communities.|$|E

2500|$|It {{appears that}} Hooke {{was one of}} a group of {{students}} whom Busby educated in parallel to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the school. [...] Contemporary accounts say he was [...] "not much seen" [...] in the school, and this appears to be true of others in a similar position. [...] Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the Protectorate. [...] To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work, those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers to explain it to those who were less able. [...] This was exemplified in the person of George Hooper, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whom Busby described as [...] "the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School".|$|E

I will ask you whether it can be supposed that these men, in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> their lives, are amusing themselves with a fictitious and idle view of the relations between man and woman;-- nay, worse than fictitious or idle; for a thing may be imaginary, yet desirable, if it were possible: but this, their ideal of woman, is, according to our common idea of the marriage relation, wholly undesirable. The woman, we say, is not to guide, nor even to think for herself. The man is always to be the wiser; he is to be the thinker, the ruler, the superior in knowledge and discretion, as in power.|$|E

60|$|That {{blackness}} at the root--though only so notable in this wood-moss and collateral species, {{is indeed}} a general character of the mosses, with rare exceptions. It is their funeral blackness;--that, I perceive, {{is the way the}} moss leaves die. They do not fall--they do not visibly decay. But they decay invisibly, in continual secession, beneath the ascending crest. They rise to form that crest, all green and bright, and take the light and air from those out of which they grew;--and those, their ancestors, darken and die slowly, and at last become a mass of mouldering ground. In fact, as I perceive farther, their final duty is so to die. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> other leaves is {19} in their life,--but these have to form the earth out of which all other leaves are to grow. Not to cover the rocks with golden velvet only, but to fill their crannies with the dark earth, through which nobler creatures shall one day seek their being.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gladstone is very {{grateful}} for your Majesty’s caution against [...] being swayed by private feelings, and he will endeavour to be on [...] his guard against them.

Such a prospect he neither sees nor anticipates. [...] But it is premature to trouble your Majesty on this minor subject.|$|E
60|$|In the {{northern}} {{point of the}} Adriatic Sea lay the city of Venice, built upon a cluster of little islands. The people had taken refuge there when Italy was overrun by the barbarians. In course of time these Venetians had grown to be a mighty and powerful people, whose merchant ships traded all over the Mediterranean, and whose counsellors were famed for wisdom. They had shaken off {{the power of the}} Greek emperor, and were governed by a senate and council, with a chosen nobleman at its head, who was called the Doge, or Duke. Just when the French, Germans, and Italians were setting off on the Fourth Crusade, in the year 1201, meaning to sail in Venetian ships, the young Alexius Angelus, son to the emperor Isaac Angelus, came to beg for help for his poor old father, who had been thrown into prison by his own brother, with his eyes put out. It was quite aside from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Crusade, but the Venetians had always had a quarrel with the Greek emperors, and they prevailed to turn the army aside to attack Constantinople. With an immense pair of shears they cut in twain the great chains which shut in the harbour of the Golden Horn, and sailed safely in, led by their Doge, Dandolo, who, though eighty years old, and blind, was as keen on the battle as the youngest man there.|$|E
2500|$|The rediscovery <b>of</b> the <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Aristotle {{allowed the}} full {{development}} of the new Christian philosophy and the method of scholasticism. By 1200 there were reasonably accurate Latin translations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, Archimedes, and Galen—that is, of all the intellectually crucial ancient authors except Plato. Also, many of the medieval Arabic and Jewish key texts, such as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Avicenna, Averroes and Maimonides now became available in Latin. During the 13th century, scholastics expanded the natural philosophy of these texts by commentaries (associated with teaching in the universities) and independent treatises.
