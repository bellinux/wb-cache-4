The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally expending little energy in movement.|$|E

For example, the San Jose Bike Party, {{held on the}} third Friday of every month, is dedicated to “building community through bicycling” and contains a majority of fixed gear riders, although all bikes are welcome. Moreover, companies such as Chrome Industries, who make bags and apparel catered toward bike messengers and urban cyclists, {{have been able to}} rise to worldwide prominence thanks to San Francisco and California’s biking community. Also, stores such as MASH SF based in San Francisco, and IMINUSD based in San Jose accommodate fixed-gear cyclist specifically with riding gear, parts, and a center for the fixed-gear riding community in their respective cities. MASH SF collaborates with the Italian bicycle manufacturing company, Cinelli, to make several fixed gear bike framesets, including {{what is known as the}} Cinelli MASH Histogram. Furthermore, Macaframa is a group of riders from San Francisco who release movies dedicated to fixed-gear riding that encompass the fast paced lifestyle <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> with riding fixed.|$|E

The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.'

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} speaks about the protagonist's {{choice between the}} comfort they find in sorrow {{and the idea of}} their {{possible}} happiness. As explained by Lee, it was meant to represent the process of [...] "breaking free" [...] from the continuous periods of feeling trapped in bad life situations and relationships, from which nevertheless, it is hard to leave even when one recognizes the negativity <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> with them. In order to delve into the aforementioned inner conflict, Lee uses the concept of addiction as a medium. The word [...] "lithium" [...] is continuously repeated throughout the song in a metaphorical sense, as the protagonist describes her love–hate relationship with sorrow. A writer of Billboard saw [...] "Lithium" [...] as a lyrical continuation of the theme explored in the band's previous single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; while in the former Lee determinedly broke up with her lover, in the latter [...] " [...] mourns his departure as she tries not to wallow in despair that's so familiar, it's almost a friend". [...] Similarly, a writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan, with the latter song exploring his [...] "apparently pathetic" [...] perspective of the story touched upon by Lee in the former one.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Musical Direction, but the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) neglected to include the title on the ballots for Emmy nominations in 2002. NATAS attempted to remedy this by mailing a postcard informing its voters {{that it should be}} included, but the episode did not win. NATAS' oversight, according to the Washington Post, was [...] "another example of the lack of industry respect afforded one of television's most consistently clever shows". Ogle in The Miami Herald vigorously protests this omission, writing, [...] "he most astonishing, entertaining hour (hour plus, actually) of TV in the past year slips by virtually unnoticed. Nothing here is real; nothing here is right. Buffy the Vampire Slayers musical episode, 'Once More, with Feeling', registers a paltry outstanding music direction nomination. Nice for the musical directors. A stake through the aspirations of writer/director Joss Whedon, the beating creative heart of Buffy, the only TV writer brave and clever enough to use horror as one great big wonderful metaphor for growing up 'Once More, with Feeling' is TV of a different sort, something <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> once in a lifetime and should not be buried but celebrated and rewarded." [...] The episode was also nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award, both given for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. In 2009 TV Guide ranked the episode #14 on its list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time".|$|E
500|$|The EP {{opens with}} [...] "Call Me Maybe", an upbeat track that draws {{influences}} from dance-pop and R. The clever lyrics {{of the song}} describes the [...] "infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight," [...] as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre-chorus, the singer states, [...] "Ripped jeans, skin was showing/Hot night, wind was blowing/Where you think you’re going, baby?" [...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy, But here's my number, So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E
