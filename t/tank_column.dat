5|$|A North Korean <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North Korean advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E

5|$|Snetkov {{was born}} on 27 February 1925 in Saratov, and {{graduated}} from Pugachyov's School No. 2. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1942 and in October 1943 graduated from accelerated courses at the 2nd Kiev Self-Propelled Artillery School as a junior lieutenant. As commander of an SU-152 self-propelled gun in the 9th Separate Guards Breakthrough Tank Regiment of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 38th Army, Snetkov saw his first combat west of Rozhiv in the Battle of Kiev on 25 November, during which his crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a Tiger tank and two guns. For his actions, Snetkov received the Order of the Red Star on 12 December. As the advance westwards across Ukraine continued into the winter, he and his regiment fought in the Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive and the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive {{as part of the}} 38th Army. During the latter operation, on 26 January, his crew was reported by a superior to have engaged a German <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> of about 20 tanks and destroyed three, one of which was a Tiger, on the LipovetsRososhe road. For this action, Snetkov received the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, on 2 February.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kommersant, {{at around}} 16:00, {{it became known}} that two <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> of the 58th Army passed the Roki Tunnel and Java and {{were on the road}} to Tskhinvali. The column had begun moving towards South Ossetia {{at the same time as}} President Medvedev was giving a {{televised}} speech. According to the official version, they were [...] "aid for peacekeeping forces, who have suffered serious losses". According to Kommersant, the Russian units had been stationed near the South Ossetian border in Alagirsky District for the past few weeks. According to Kommersant, at around 17:00, Russian <b>tanks</b> <b>columns</b> bypassed Tskhinvali and began bombing the Georgian fortifications. The secretary of the Security Council of South Ossetia Anatoly Barankevich stated that the Georgians were leaving Tshvinvali.|$|R
5000|$|During that {{rapid advance}} across France the 373d Fighter Group and other XIX Tactical Air Command units blazed {{the way for}} General Patton's <b>tank</b> <b>columns.</b> The 373d, {{along with the other}} units, {{provided}} [...] "umbrella cover" [...] for the advancing ground forces, knocked out enemy rail and railroad transportation, and struck again and again at enemy tanks, gun emplacements, troop concentrations, and strongpoints.|$|R
50|$|During {{that same}} day, Savannahs scout planes {{started a new}} phase of warfare by {{successfully}} bombing some <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> with their depth charges, whose fuses had been set to detonate on impact. The scout planes, maintaining about eight hours of flight time daily, struck at other shore targets, and they also kept up antisubmarine patrols. Savannahs warplanes located an enemy battery that had been firing on the destroyer , and eliminated the battery with two well-placed depth charges.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{continued}} its fast pace of advance, with Hill continuing to ride pillion on his motorcycle, and by 23 April it {{had reached the}} River Elbe, having advanced 103 miles in fourteen days; the division had captured more than 19,000 prisoners during this period. After crossing the Elbe, the division once again came {{under the command of}} U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, with General Ridgway informing Major General Bols that it was vital the division reach the port of Wismar before the approaching Russian Army did, to ensure that Denmark was not occupied by the Soviet Union. Although the 5th Parachute Brigade was ordered to lead the division's advance, Hill was determined to reach Wismar first; after an extremely rapid advance he succeeded, with troops from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion being the first to enter Wismar, beating an advancing Russian <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> by only a few miles. A few days later, on 7 May 1945, Germany surrendered and the war in Europe came to an end. Hill was awarded a second Bar to his DSO for his command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade during its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, as well as the American Silver Star.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of Taganrog collected {{money for the}} construction of a <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> Taganrog, which was built from that money and given over to the army of General Pavel Rybalko. Some of these tanks with inscriptions Taganrog participated at the Battle of Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{fighting}} {{took place}} throughout the day. The YPA <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> {{that had been}} attacked at Pesnica the previous day was blocked by impromptu barricades of Slovenian trucks at Štrihovec, a few miles short of the border with Austria, where it again came under attack by Slovenian TO personnel and Slovenian police. The SFR Yugoslav Air Force mounted two airstrikes {{in support of the}} YPA forces at Strihovec, killing four truck drivers. At Medvedjek in central Slovenia, another YPA <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> came under attack at a truck barricade, where air raids killed six truck drivers. Heavy fighting broke out at Nova Gorica on the border with Italy, where the Slovenian Special Forces destroyed three YPA T-55 tanks and captured an additional three. Four YPA soldiers were killed, among them the commander of the armored column, and nearly 100 more surrendered. Some sources claim that this was the decisive battle of the war.|$|E
5000|$|By 15:00 MSK, an {{emergency}} meeting of Security Council of Russia had been convened by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and Russia's options regarding {{the conflict in}} South Ossetia had been discussed. Russia accused Georgia of [...] "aggression against South Ossetia". Russia stated it was defending both peacekeepers and South Ossetian civilians (who were Russian citizens). While Russia claimed {{that it had to}} conduct peacekeeping operations according to the international mandates, in reality such agreements had only arranged the ceasefire observer status; according to political scientist Roy Allison, Russia could evacuate its peacekeepers if attacked. At around 16:00 MSK, it became known that two <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> of the 58th Army passed the Roki Tunnel and Java and were on the road to Tskhinvali. According to Kommersant, the column had begun moving towards South Ossetia {{at the same time as}} President Medvedev was giving a televised speech. At around 17:00 MSK, Russian <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> surrounded Tskhinvali and began bombing the Georgian positions. The Russian Air Force mounted attacks on Georgian infantry and artillery on 8 August, but suspended sorties for two days after taking early losses from anti-aircraft fire. Georgian troops left the centre of the town in the evening.|$|R
50|$|Weaponry {{used by the}} United States {{during the}} Gulf War also poses a huge risk to the {{environmental}} stability of the area. <b>Tank</b> <b>columns</b> in the desert plains may disrupt the fragile stability {{that exists in the}} desert currently. In 1991, the movement of US tanks over the desert damaged the top protective layer of the desert soil. As a result, a sand dune was released and has started slowly moving downhill. Some people fear this dune could ultimately reach Kuwait City.|$|R
50|$|The battle {{started on}} 10 September, when Indian troops {{launched}} a massive attack at the Phillora sector. Its 1st Armoured Division {{was on the}} offensive in that area. Equipped with four armoured regiments, this division faced stiff opposition from the Pakistani 6th Armoured Division. Pakistani air attacks did little damage to the <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> and more to lorry and infantry columns. For {{the next two days}} intense fighting continued and the outnumbered Pakistani troops made a tactical retreat towards Chawinda. At this point India claimed to destroyed 67 Pakistani tanks.|$|R
25|$|Unlike Lavoshin's formation, {{the eight}} 107 Squadron Phantoms from Hatzerim were flying a {{slightly}} different route to the target. These failed to spot any opening in the cloud cover over the target and therefore requested an alternate target. The Phantoms were diverted to bomb Syrian armor near Hushniyah, on the Golan Heights. Their strike decimated a <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> and allowed Israeli forces to push Syrian forces back over the pre-war ceasefire lines. The trailing 69 Squadron aircraft, having heard the 107 strike called off, returned to base after dumping their bombs and excess fuel in the Mediterranean, a decision which would later lead to much criticism from fellow pilots.|$|E
25|$|Suicide {{bombing was}} also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops {{strapped}} explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.|$|E
25|$|The Slovenian Territorial Defence {{also took}} up {{position}} around YPA barracks in various locations, effectively besieging them, {{and launched a}} series of attacks on YPA forces across Slovenia. At Brnik, a Slovenian TO unit attacked the YPA troops holding the airport, and at Trzin a firefight developed in which four YPA soldiers and one Slovenian TO soldier (Edvard Peperko) were killed and {{the remainder of the}} YPA unit was forced to surrender. Attacks were also launched by Slovenian TO units on YPA tank columns at Pesnica, Ormož and Koseze near Ilirska Bistrica. A <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> from the YPA's 32nd Mechanised Brigade, advancing from Varaždin in Croatia, was blocked at Ormož near the Slovenian border and found itself unable to break through a Slovenian barricade.|$|E
25|$|To the north, the Chinese {{continued}} {{to oppose the}} efforts of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team to capture Hill 228. Using Route 33 and a lesser road to the west, two <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> from the 3d Division joined Bowen's forces during the afternoon of March 26, but, even with armored support, it was 09:00 the following day before the 187th captured Hill 228. Using the remainder of March 27 for reorganization and resupply, General Bowen attacked the heights {{on the east side of}} Route 33 early on March 28 and occupied them after an all-day battle to eliminate stiff resistance.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 22 June, the German {{armoured}} spearheads {{over the}} Niemen had penetrated [...] The next day, Kuznetsov committed his armoured forces to battle. Near Raseiniai, the XLI Panzer Corps was counter-attacked by the Soviet 3rd and 12th Mechanised Corps. The concentration of Soviet armour was detected by the Luftwaffe, which immediately attacked <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> of the 12th Mechanised Corps south-west of Šiauliai. No Soviet fighters appeared and the Soviet 23rd Tank Division sustained particularly severe losses, Ju 88s from Luftflotte 1 attacking at low level, setting 40 vehicles, including tanks and lorries on fire.|$|R
50|$|American troop {{movements}} {{continued through the}} area until 18 April, with the <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> taking {{the first three days}} to pass through. The inhabitants could only use the main street between noon and 1 p.m. each day, and all the streets in the village were torn up by tank tracks. On 4 July 1945, Russian soldiers arrived in Holungen, the village lying only 10 km from the border with the British occupation zone (see this page about the GDR for a map of the zones). On 20 August the majority of the Russian troops withdrew and only a small garrison remained.|$|R
25|$|The team {{started off}} the tournament with a convincing victory against Venezuela, {{followed}} by an upset to Nigeria the following day. With all three teams tied with one win and one loss, Venezuela wound up disqualified due to a lesser point difference. Afterwards, many incidents regarding the Lithuanian squad were rumored {{to be caused by}} disgruntled Venezuelans. These included a <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> near the training hall polluting the air during the Lithuanian team workout, a broken bus during the trip to the arena before the quarter-final game against Puerto Rico, and vanished jerseys and water during said match. Despite all that, Lithuania managed to defeat Puerto Rico in a dramatic game. In the semifinals, Lithuania crushed the Dominican Republic and thus qualified for the 2012 London Olympics.|$|E
25|$|During the 1982 Lebanon War, the Syrian Air Force {{fought the}} Israeli Air Force {{in one of}} the largest air-to-air combats of the jet age, {{involving}} approximately 150 aircraft from both sides. In six days (6–11 June 1982) of intense aerial combat, Syrian and Russian sources admit the loss of 24 MiG-23s (6MF, 4MS and 14BN), while shooting down no Israeli aircraft. Russian and Syrian sources continue to claim a modicum of success against Israeli aircraft in this conflict, but have been unable to provide any justification for their claims. Israel claims the destruction of 85 Syrian MiGs (including Mig-21s as well as Mig-23s). However, at low altitude the Syrian Air Force effectively used Aerospatiale Gazelle helicopters in anti-armour role against advancing Israeli ground forces. In one such engagement, an Israeli <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> was stopped for some hours by SAF Gazelle missile strikes while approaching Ein Zehalta.|$|E
500|$|The latter, however, {{would not}} arrive. Moving from Myriofyto towards Akritas, it was {{attacked}} by a German column near Amaranta and forced to withdraw towards Myriofyto. Further east, another German <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> surprised and took prisoner the two companies of the 1st Security Battalion marching {{to take over the}} Metamorfosi heights position. The Batsova heights were occupied by one company of the 11th Border Sector, arriving from Kilkis on cars, but a company of the 1st Security Battalion tasked with joining it disintegrated on the march. As a result, by 10:30 the left flank of the division had become cut off and the Germans had effectively broken through the left of the Krousia defensive line. Further chaos resulted from an order to the division's units to retreat, which was countermanded by TSAM, resulting in some units remaining in place while others began abandoning the Krousia position. Thus 192nd Regiment left its Foot Battalion in the Krousia area and began withdrawing towards Kilkis. In the same night, 191st Regiment dispatched a mixed mechanized detachment—a light tank company, a car-borne company, and the [...] "English" [...] artillery company—to reinforce the Greek positions north of Sidirokastro.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 22 June, the German {{armoured}} spearheads {{over the}} Niemen had penetrated 80 km. The next day, Kuznetsov committed his armoured forces to battle.

500|$|Once {{the tanks}} reached the {{infantry}} line Second Lieutenant Ollie Connor fired some 22 2.36-inch rockets {{at a range}} of [...] from his M9A1 launcher tube. Some of these rockets failed to ignite. The remainder did and several struck the rear plate armor of several T-34s, where their armor was thinnest. The warheads failed to penetrate the armor, however, and the North Korean tanks continued their advance, ignoring the roadblock and continuing down the road. The operators assumed the roadblock was manned by South Korean troops, and ignored it since it did not pose them a serious threat. When the <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> came over {{the crest of the}} road, the forward howitzer, commanded by Corporal Herman V. Critchfield, Chief of Section and 5 cannoneers, fired its HEAT rounds, damaging the first two tanks and setting one of them on fire. One of the crew members of the burning tank emerged with a PPSh-41 and killed a member of an American machine gun crew before being killed himself; the American became the first casualty of Korean War ground combat. He was later identified, incorrectly, as Kenneth R. Shadrick. The howitzer, depleted of HEAT rounds, began firing high explosive rounds before being destroyed by the third T-34. The tanks then advanced, continuing to ignore the American howitzer and bazooka fire. U.S. forces managed to disable another North Korean T-34 when a 105mm shell struck and damaged its tracks. The tracks of the T-34 tanks cut communication signal wires between the infantry and artillery forces, further compounding the confusion. Perry was wounded in the leg by North Korean small arms fire as he was attempting to get the crew of the disabled tank to surrender. His artillery force continued firing at the North Korean tanks without effect.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 22/23 May the AA units engaged Luftwaffe raiders that bombed Calais, {{starting}} fires. But ground attack was now the biggest danger, and the S/L men had to man the perimeter as infantry, a role for which they (mainly older Territorials, raw militiamen and a few ex-RE reservists) were untrained. Goldney ordered his S/L detachments to concentrate at their Troop HQs (THQs) at dawn on 23 May, dig trenches and erect roadblocks. The first serious attack came the following day, against a position held by C Troop of 1st S/L Bty on the Saint-Omer canal at Les Attaques, eight miles south-east of Calais. Reinforced by men from 2nd S/L Bty they put up a stout fight, halting a <b>tank</b> <b>column</b> for three hours before they were [...] overwhelmed.|$|E
2500|$|Loza {{graduated}} from the Saratov Tank School in 1942. From August 1943, he fought in combat and was wounded. He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class on 13 September. [...] After leaving the hospital in November, he was appointed chief of armaments of the 233rd Tank Brigade's 1st Battalion. In late January 1944, he fought in the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive. Loza received the Order of the Red Star on 22 April 1944. He was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky on 23 February 1945. By 1945, he was a captain commanding the 1st Tank Battalion of the 46th Guards Tank Brigade, equipped with the M4 Sherman. His tank battalion {{was reported to have}} captured trains loaded with ammunition, two warehouses and an artillery workshop with 14 guns, as well as 4 Panther tanks on railway platforms on 23 March on the way to Veszprém. On the same day, the battalion fought an action against a German <b>tank</b> <b>column,</b> reportedly knocking out 29 tanks and self-propelled guns, capturing 20 and destroying 10 vehicles. It also reportedly killed 250 German soldiers. After advancing 100 kilometers, the battalion broke through to Vienna on 9 April, holding there for a day before the arrival {{of the rest of the}} brigade. After the end of the war against Germany, the brigade was transferred to the Transbaikal Front. [...] In August 1945, Loza fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

50|$|Of the {{approximately}} 201,000 personnel {{on active duty}} in the ČSLA in 1987, about 145,000, or about 72 percent, served in the ground forces (commonly {{referred to as the}} army). About 100,000 of these were conscripts. There were two military districts, Western and Eastern. They contained infantry, supported by tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery. Czechoslovak military doctrine demanded large <b>tank</b> <b>columns</b> spearheading infantry assaults. While the armoured columns secured objectives, the infantry would provide close support with mortars, snipers, anti-tank guns and medium artillery. The majority of the soldiers in the Ground Forces were recruited through conscription, compulsory military service of 24 months for all males between 18 and 27.|$|R
5000|$|The renewed allied {{offensive}} in early 1945, following the Battle of the Bulge, {{was supported in}} earnest by the building of tactical airfields in occupied Germany.

Hitler decided against this plan, and insisted that the pockets containing Soviet armies must be destroyed before advancing deeper into Russia. Bock, enraged by this decision, was quoted as saying: [...] "We are permitting our greatest chance of success to escape us by this restriction placed on our armor!" ...|$|R
