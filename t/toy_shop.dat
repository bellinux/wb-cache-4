5|$|The {{toy store}} Hamleys is at No.188 Regent Street, {{just south of}} Oxford Circus. It was founded as Noah's Ark at No.231 High Holborn in 1760. An {{additional}} branch opened at Nos.64–66 Regent Street in 1881, while the original High Holborn building burned down in 1901, moving to Nos.86–87. The store was frequently the first to market the latest games and toys, and became a strong seller of table tennis equipment in the late 19th century, allowing the sport to become popular. The business moved to Nos.200–202, {{and moved to the}} current address in 1981. It claims to be the largest <b>toy</b> <b>shop</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock's <b>Toy</b> <b>Shop.</b> Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall {{on the south side of}} the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the property company Capital & Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006.|$|E

500|$|Princess Anne {{had fallen}} out with her sister and brother-in-law, William and Mary, and reluctantly agreed to the advice of her friend, the Countess of Marlborough, that Gloucester should visit his aunt and uncle {{regularly}} to ensure their continued goodwill towards him. In an attempt to heal the rift, Anne invited the King and Queen to see Gloucester drill the [...] "Horse Guards". After watching the boys' display at Kensington Palace, the King praised them, and made a return visit to Campden House the following day. Gloucester grew closer to his aunt and uncle: the Queen bought him presents from his favourite <b>toy</b> <b>shop</b> regularly. Her death in 1694 led to a superficial reconciliation between Anne and William, which occasioned a move to St James's Palace, London. Gloucester having tired of him, Lewis only attended St James's every two months.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the <b>toy</b> <b>shop,</b> she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the <b>toy</b> <b>shop,</b> and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

500|$|Of the art style, game {{designer}} and artist Ken Wong said he aspired {{to make each}} frame of the gameplay worthy of public display. The project began as Wong's concept drawings before it became a game project. The visual style [...] was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and [...] Wong added that the gameplay was designed to let the player find {{the object of the}} game through exploration, without direct guidance. The game uses colors to signify where the player can interact, similar to Mirror's Edge. Wong compared the gameplay experience to a cross between the wonder of a <b>toy</b> <b>shop</b> and the world of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and its story to a symbolic [...] "song" [...] rather than a narrative book. The game was designed to be completed by most players, a style uncommon for games designed for popular audiences.

500|$|Having {{neutralized}} {{opponents of}} the sales tax, Laffoon encouraged legislators to lower the state income and automobile taxes, which he believed would leave no alternative source of revenue except a sales tax. The General Assembly passed the requested cuts, and in July 1934, Laffoon called another special session to consider the sales tax. Pro-administration officials organized parades and demonstrations {{in favor of the}} tax. By contrast, a group of 100 unemployed men marched on Frankfort demanding financial relief. Some of them made death threats against Laffoon, and the Kentucky National Guard surrounded the governor's mansion to protect him. Although anti-sales-tax forces used parliamentary procedures that stalled a vote for weeks, a three percent sales tax was approved {{by the end of the}} session. The tax was derided in a children's chant that said [...] "Hippity-hop to the <b>toy</b> <b>shop</b> to buy a red balloon. A penny for you, a penny for me, a penny for Ruby Laffoon." [...] Following the special session, Laffoon was admitted to a sanatorium, where he was treated for exhaustion.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, {{appears to have been}} desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a <b>toy</b> <b>shop,</b> and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied [...] "to your father this is a toy shop." [...] Lord Rosebery's friend Edward Hamilton recorded her [...] "notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies." [...] It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, with her feet firmly on the ground. She made herself the link between the world and her [...] "thin skinned and neurotic" [...] husband. While her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation, she came to the forefront to plead his case or cause. If she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it.|$|E

2500|$|Since Conley's {{theory of}} reform was based so heavily on manual labor, {{he had spent}} little time and money on things like {{education}} and vocational training. [...] In the 1920s, the prison library was {{the only means of}} inmate education; the only classes being taught boiled down to English-speaking instruction for immigrant inmates. [...] The library itself, donated mostly by William Clark before 1920, was outdated, contained mainly light fiction, and had been stringently censored by prison officials. [...] As far as vocational training was concerned, Conley had dealt the prison another blow by removing all his personal equipment from the warehouse, garage, and machine shop; since his contract specified that the buildings, grounds, and land belonged to the state, he had populated these important industries with his own materials to further entrench himself within the prison. [...] This left the prisoners with only industries relating to the upkeep of the prison: laundry, garment construction, maintenance, a <b>toy</b> <b>shop</b> (which made toys for children in state institutions) and the prison band.

A new feature introduced in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes is the Text Creator, which allows players to write their own text bubbles in the Toybox.
