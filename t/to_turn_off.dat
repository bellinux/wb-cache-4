5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E

At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|The Little Busters {{will also}} {{participate}} in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission will either be completed or failed {{depending on the}} choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The {{first time that the}} game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} impacts from Igor {{were attributed to}} torrential rains, which led to excessive runoff and flash flooding. Several rivers rose to record levels across the Bonavista and Burin Peninsulas where many roads were washed out. Entire bridges, homes and portions of roads were destroyed. In some instances, flood waters were higher than entire homes. In response to the widespread floods, Newfoundland Power Inc. warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of September21 <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> their main electrical panel if water enters their basement. Parts of St. Bernard's – Jacques Fontaine had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded {{some areas of the}} small town. Portions of Clarenville had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town. Water and sewage lines in Sunnyside broke due to flooding. In Glovertown, downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm, both of which were put out by firefighters without injuries.|$|E
5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E

As Alison had signed a DNR form, Lexie is forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the machine keeping her alive, despite Gary begging her to stop. After failing in an attempt to sue the hospital, a grief-stricken Mr. Clark later returns to the hospital with a gun, seeking revenge on Lexie, Derek and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). After witnessing Mr. Clark shoot a nurse dead, Mark shields Lexie during the shooting and the pair attempt to save a critically wounded Alex. Seeking supplies, Lexie heads out into the hospital and comes face to face with Mr Clark who attempts to shoot her, but she is saved by a SWAT team member who wounds Clark at the last moment allowing her to escape. Lexie and Mark proceed to save Alex's life, but Lexie is disappointed and irritated when a delirious Alex calls for his ex-wife, Izzie, while nearly dying instead of Lexie. After a showdown with Richard, Gary Clark eventually commits suicide, having killed eleven people and wounding another seven, as well as causing Meredith to suffer a miscarriage.|$|E
