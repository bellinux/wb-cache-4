5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on <b>their</b> <b>emotions.</b> In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing <b>their</b> <b>emotions</b> and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control <b>their</b> <b>emotions.</b> Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe <b>their</b> <b>emotions,</b> homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by <b>their</b> <b>emotions,</b> and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

40|$|Based on Gross's {{process model}} of emotion regulation, this study related 53 lower-secondary school students' {{perceptions}} of <b>their</b> teachers' <b>emotions</b> to four of <b>their</b> teachers' <b>emotion</b> regulation while teaching. A mixed method approach, combining students' surveys and teachers' interviews, revealed associations between teachers' {{positive or negative}} emotions as perceived by their students, and teachers' reflections on <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation. Antecedent-focused emotion regulation appeared more desirable than response-focused emotion regulation, and in particular, reappraisal more effective than suppression in increasing positive-emotion expression and reducing negative-emotion expression. Implications for teaching, teacher education and future research on teacher emotion regulation are proposed...|$|R

25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} <b>their</b> <b>emotions</b> with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share <b>their</b> <b>emotions</b> equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E

40|$|Ninety-three {{children}} {{ranging in}} age from 5 to 8 years (M = 82 : 46 months, SD = 13 : 20) participated in a training study designed to improve <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> understanding. Children either explained (self-explanation condition) or listened to an experimenter who explained (experimenter-explanation condition) the causes of protagonists' hidden and ambivalent emotional reactions in nine different vignettes. Compared to a control group who listened to the vignettes and answered questions unrelated to emotions, children assigned to the self-explanation and experimenter-explanation conditions increased from pre- to post-test in <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> understanding. The educational implications of explanatory conversations in facilitating children's emotion understanding and general learning are discussed. © 2008 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the role of emotion {{regulation}} and reinforcement sensitivity in dysfunctional eating behaviours. Two hundred twenty-eight adults from the Australian community completed self-report inventories assessing the variables. Dysfunctional restrained eaters differed from {{those who did not}} engage in restrained eating in terms of <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation, impulsivity, and sensitivity to reward. Difficulties in emotion regulation, low impulsivity, and sensitivity to reward predicted engagement in restrained eating. Emotional eaters significantly differed from those who did not engage in dysfunctional levels of emotional eating in terms of <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation, impulsivity, and sensitivity towards reward, and difficulties in emotion regulation predicted emotional eating. Finally, dysfunctional external eaters differed from non-dysfunctional external eaters in terms of <b>their</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation, impulsivity, sensitivity towards reward, as well as sensitivity towards punishment, and difficulties with emotion regulation and sensitivity towards reward predicted external eating. These findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of emotional functioning in models of development and maintenance of eating disorders, and support the potential implementation of treatment interventions that address emotion regulation and include strategies to cope with impulsivity and reinforcement sensitivities...|$|R
40|$|While {{many with}} {{schizophrenia}} experience deficits in metacognition {{it is unclear}} whether those deficits are related to other features of illness. To explore this issue, the current study classified participants with schizophrenia as possessing a deficit in both awareness of <b>their</b> own <b>emotions</b> and those of others (n = 30), aware of <b>their</b> own <b>emotions</b> but unaware of the emotions of others (n = 50) and aware of <b>their</b> own <b>emotions</b> and of other’s emotions (n = 17). Groups were compared on assessments of neurocognitive function, symptoms, and history of sexual trauma. ANCOVA controlling for education found that the group unaware of <b>their</b> own <b>emotions</b> and those of others demonstrated poorer verbal memory, processing speed, executive function, less emotional discomfort and higher levels of disorganization symptoms relative to the other groups. The group aware of <b>their</b> own <b>emotions</b> but not those of others had a significantly higher report of childhood sexual abuse...|$|R

25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and <b>their</b> <b>emotions</b> {{back into the}} conscious.

40|$|Accuracy at reading nonverbal cues to {{emotions}} {{was examined}} for close friends, less close friends, and strangers.

Each judge watched a videotape of both a platonic friend and a stranger. Overall, friends were more accurate than strangers at identifying the senders emotions, however, less close friends were better than closer friends at correctly judging concealed sadness and anger. In discussing these findings, we consider models of motivated inaccuracy, accommodatingness, and emotions as calls to action...|$|R

25|$|Mother Courage {{is among}} Brecht's most famous plays. Some {{directors}} consider {{it to be}} the greatest play of the 20th century. Brecht expresses the dreadfulness of war and the idea that virtues are not rewarded in corrupt times. He used an epic structure to force the audience to focus on the issues rather than getting involved with the characters and <b>their</b> <b>emotions.</b> Epic plays are a distinct genre typical of Brecht. Some critics believe that he created the form.|$|E
25|$|The Merchant of Four Seasons uses melodrama as a {{style to}} create {{critical}} studies of contemporary German {{life for a}} general audience. It was Fassbinder's first effort to create what he declared he aspired to: a cinematic statement {{of the human condition}} that would transcend national boundaries as the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini had done. It is also his first realization of what he learned from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and <b>their</b> <b>emotions,</b> however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.|$|E
25|$|The Heroides ("Heroines") or Epistulae Heroidum are a {{collection}} of 21 poems in elegiac couplets. The Heroides {{take the form of}} letters addressed by famous mythological characters to their partners expressing <b>their</b> <b>emotions</b> at being separated from them, pleas for their return, and allusions to their future actions within their own mythology. The authenticity of the collection, partially or as a whole, has been questioned, although most scholars would consider the letters mentioned specifically in Ovid's description of the work at Am. 2.18.19–26 as safe from objection. The collection comprises a new type of generic composition without parallel in earlier literature.|$|E
