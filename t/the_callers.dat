25|$|Following {{the talk}} at the Madame Walker Theatre, Wilson {{appeared}} on the Amos Brown radio show to continue to dialogue with the community. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> supported the artwork. Some suggested that the artwork was better suited for a museum, where visitors could choose to see his work, {{rather than in a}} permanent public space.|$|E
25|$|Weigman’s first {{experience}} with phreaking was by accident. He was on a party line when he discovered that by pressing the star and pound keys, he could {{gain access to the}} numbers of all <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> on the party line. He realized that he could get the number of anyone that angered him and he could harass them at their home phone number.|$|E
25|$|Kilgour and Matas {{concede that}} {{in at least}} some instances, the {{hospital}} staff may have been supplying answers that <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> wanted to hear {{in order to make a}} sale. The results of these phone calls would also be difficult to replicate; as allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong gained attention, hospitals would become more reluctant to candidly discuss their organ sourcing practices.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} call, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> didn't say anything, but just breathed heavily. Manolo stayed quiet, also saying nothing. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then asked, [...] "You stay in silence, old faggot?". Manolo {{replied that he}} thought <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> was <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> mother, masturbating him, and then hung up.|$|R
5000|$|Calling 000 greets <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> with a {{recorded}} message stating [...] "You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected" [...] then connects <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to a Telstra operator who will then connect <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to <b>the</b> emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> if they require the [...] "Police, Fire, Ambulance?" [...] and their location if calling from a mobile phone or nomadic service. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> is then {{connected to the}} relevant emergency service answer point as requested by <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the sixth}} and final one, <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> one more time with a high-pitched voice, said he was Manolo's anus. Manolo insulted him, telling <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> he didn't have a mother. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> {{said that it was}} again a joke from El Vacilón, and Manolo insulted <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> mother, and then he hung up.|$|R
25|$|On October 10, 2006, the {{transcripts}} of the 911 calls made October 2, 2006, {{in connection with}} the attack were released. <b>The</b> <b>callers</b> identified in {{the transcripts}} were Amos Smoker, the same man who telephoned 911 reporting the armed invader at the school, Roberts, and Roberts' wife Marie. In some cases the transcript indicates the line went dead because the call was transferred to state police and was not recorded by Lancaster County.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, {{immediately}} after allegations emerged that Falun Gong prisoners were being targeted for organ harvesting, overseas investigators began placing {{phone calls to}} Chinese hospitals and police detention centers. <b>The</b> <b>callers</b> posed as prospective transplant recipients or organ brokers and inquired about the availability of Falun Gong organs. In several instances, they obtained recorded admissions that organs could be procured from Falun Gong prisoners. A selection of these conversations were cited as evidence in the report by David Kilgour and David Matas.|$|E
25|$|Because of poor ratings, Kiley and Booms were {{canceled}} on November 13, 1998, which {{happened to be}} Friday. WTEM moved the highly rated The Tony Kornheiser Show to the 47 p.m. slot as a tape delay show to replace Kiley and Booms. Kornheiser {{did not like the}} idea because he would lose <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> from the WTEM broadcasting area. WTEM moved The Doc and Al Show into the 14 p.m. slot and created a new show hosted by Rich Cook and Kris O'Donnell in the 10 a.m.1 p.m. slot.|$|E
50|$|An {{element of}} dynamic content can be {{introduced}} to the recording so that it responds to <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> ID in an intelligent way e.g. it could simply read out <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> ID of <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> it could specifically advise what location the call is coming from, based on <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> ID, or it could check <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> ID against a customer database and therefore advise the agent which customer is calling in and what their account number is.|$|R
50|$|As Rathod and {{his team}} desperately try to locate <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> <b>the</b> four militants demanded by <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> are rounded up by police {{officers}} Arif (Jimmy Shergill) and Jai (Aamir Bashir). In the meanwhile, police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then asks <b>the</b> two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on an airport runway, but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as he suspects that <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> would not reveal {{the locations of the}} bombs even after the militants are released.|$|R

25|$|The FBI, which {{initially}} sent {{agents to}} help recover debris, investigated possible foul {{play in the}} crash. After a few days, the bureau determined that the crash was accidental, but only after following several criminal leads involving death threats. Wellstone had been receiving death threats since he took office; the FBI tapped his phone to locate <b>the</b> <b>callers.</b> Documents about the FBI's involvement in investigating Wellstone's death were not publicly released until October 2010. Government documents also indicated that the FBI had been following Wellstone {{before he became a}} senator, and included records dating as far back as his arrest at a 1970 antiwar protest.|$|E
25|$|From Green's website, Tom Green's House Tonight {{typically}} aired live on weeknights at 10pm EST, although shows {{can begin}} {{at any time}} during the day and night. The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and Skype video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often be a victim of prank calls due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with <b>the</b> <b>callers.</b> On top of the live web show, Green has added many video segments from his past as well as present.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} from initial {{notification}} until a unit is dispatched {{can take up}} to two (2) minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by <b>the</b> <b>caller(s)</b> and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street fire alarm box is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street fire alarm box.|$|E
50|$|If {{the call}} {{originates}} on a POTS line (a standard loop start line), then caller ID {{is provided by}} the service provider's local switch. Since the network does not connect <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to <b>the</b> callee until the phone is answered, generally <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> ID signal cannot be altered by <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> Most service providers however, allow <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to block caller ID presentation through the vertical service code *67.|$|R
5000|$|Up {{until the}} phone lines were {{connected}} directly to Penn's house {{there would be a}} significant delay between the time Penn said <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> name and when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> would respond, this would sometimes result in <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> being dropped just after they said hello. There was also many times when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> would be dropped completely and Penn would have to pick another <b>caller</b> from <b>the</b> list.|$|R
5|$|The app {{displays}} {{information on}} callers, {{such as their}} latest social media posts, local weather at <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> location and <b>the</b> identity of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> It originally {{had the ability to}} display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> location and <b>the</b> identity of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> <b>The</b> ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} days, the file {{download}} library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBSes and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library {{to ensure that}} the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, shareware CD-ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each CD-ROM. Small BBSes copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD-ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBSes used Multiple CD-ROM disc changer units that switched 6 CD-ROM disks on demand for <b>the</b> <b>caller(s).</b> Large systems used all 26 DOS drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright-free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.|$|E
25|$|He was {{replaced}} by PPP member Somchai Wongsawat. As of October 2008, Wongsawat was unable {{to gain access to}} his offices, which were occupied by protesters from the People's Alliance for Democracy. On 2 December 2008, Thailand's Constitutional Court in a highly controversial ruling found the Peoples Power Party (PPP) guilty of electoral fraud, which led to the dissolution of the party according to the law. It was later alleged in media reports that at least one member of the judiciary had a telephone conversation with officials working for the Office of the Privy Council and one other person. The phone call was taped and has since circulated on the Internet. In it, <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> discuss finding a way to ensure the ruling PPP party would be disbanded. Accusations of judicial interference were levelled in the media but the recorded call was dismissed as a hoax. However, in June 2010, supporters of the eventually disbanded PPP were charged with tapping a judge's phone.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{airing of}} the first episodes, a New York {{attorney}} named Morris Beagle filed a lawsuit for $300,000 alleging his name had been slandered, and that its use was damaging his business and his health. He also claimed that people were calling his law firm and asking, [...] "Is this Mr. Beagle?" [...] When he answered, [...] "Yes", <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> would say, [...] "How's your partner, Shyster?" [...] and hang up the phone. The sponsors and studio executives panicked, and from episode four {{the title of the}} show was changed to [...] "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel", and Walter T. Beagle was renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel. It was explained in the episode that the character had divorced and reverted to his [...] "maiden name".|$|E
50|$|On a two-cassette answerphone, {{there is}} an {{outgoing}} cassette, which after the specified number of rings plays a pre-recorded message to <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> Once <b>the</b> message is complete, the outgoing cassette stops and the incoming cassette starts recording <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> message, and then stops when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> hangs up.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} call, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{said that he}} was from a laundry, saying that Manolo hadn't picked up his shirt. Manolo replied that he never left a shirt there, so <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> said that <b>the</b> shirt had his name. When Manolo demanded to know what name was printed, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> said [...] "Manolo Cabeza de Huevo". Manolo, realizing it was a joke, told him that he was [...] "starting" [...] to fell for it. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then {{said that he was}} going to use the hanger as an antenna, so Manolo told him to {{straight}} it up and put it in <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> butt. Then he hung up.|$|R
50|$|Maraar {{initially}} suspects <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to be bluffing, but {{his doubts}} are dispelled as <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> {{to prove his}} seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Anna Salai police station. When the bomb disposal squad find the bomb, there is only three minutes left. They manage to deactivate the bomb after following <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> instructions. Natasha reaches the scene on <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> instructions and reports about the situation. An intense debate ensues between Maraar and the chief secretary on who would act as the negotiator with <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> <b>The</b> chief secretary appoints Maraar as the State's negotiator with unrestricted power for one day. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> talks full of life logics and religious philosophy and finally asks Maarar to release three convicted terrorists and one Hindu (a convicted arms seller), all who were arrested by him years ago.|$|R
500|$|Andy {{starts to}} {{volunteer}} at the Comfort Support Line (CSL), a crisis hotline, {{after the death}} of his sister. His supervisor George takes him through the procedure for calls, and Andy chats to the more experienced Liz. He finds his first few calls difficult, and Joanne, a volunteer who shares a mutual distaste with Liz, advises him not to get emotionally invested in <b>the</b> <b>callers.</b> Andy takes a call from Chloe, a 16-year-old girl with problems at home. Chloe says that she has taken a drug overdose, and Andy sings [...] "Shine" [...] by Take That to her, but, when he finishes, Chloe is no longer on the line. He immediately takes a call from an elderly woman distraught that her cat has died, but responds insensitively, and hangs up.|$|E
500|$|Hardy {{released}} two character promotional vignettes, that he {{was planning}} to use before he was offered a new contract by WWE. Hardy called himself The Angelic Diablo with the tagline [...] "the scar will become a symbol" [...] in reference {{to the way in which}} he had been treated by Lita and WWE. On the June 20 episode of Raw, during the storyline wedding of Edge and Lita, Hardy's entrance music and video were played when the priest asked if anyone had a reason why Edge and Lita should not be wed. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Hardy made his return, attacking Edge as he made his way to the ring. On the July 13 episode of WWE's webcast Byte This!, which featured Lita as its guest, one of <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> was Hardy himself.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1993, Katz {{installed}} a nationwide 800 number at Real Life Storybooks, {{where people could}} ask questions and directly order storybooks about real-life situations. The 800 number was one number off from another {{that led to a}} nationwide hot line designed to prevent child abuse. Katz often received misdialed child abuse calls. Despite her informing <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> that they had dialed a wrong number, <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> often continued, relating stories such as a father who wanted Katz's input on the potential harm [...] "if he were to rape his 4-month-old daughter lying naked next to him" [...] and a [...] "mother of a 9-month-old who was convinced the child was trying to [...] "get her goat" [...] by crying." [...] Eventually, Katz changed the 800 number per the request of the purveyors of the child abuse hotline, reasoning that [...] "I changed my 800 number because I was asked to do so, so <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> could get the help they needed." ...|$|E
50|$|The Dialogic {{cards are}} capable of making and {{answering}} calls, identifying caller ID, playing back sounds to <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (touch tones) dialed by <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> They can also tear down a call and detect when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> has hung up.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of {{what they}} do, the agent who owns that 800 call capture phone number will be {{notified}} within 30 seconds of <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> phone number. If <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> is calling from a home-based phone, then {{the real estate agent}} will also receive a notification with <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> phone number, name and address.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} one, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{spoke with a}} normal voice. He told Manolo to fix his pipe. Manolo, trying to relax by an overforced breathing, asked him in which floor <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> lived. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> responded, [...] "in the back one". After Manolo demanded an {{explanation}} of which floor he meant, since the building has only a backyard in <b>the</b> back, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> said [...] "in the one of your ass" [...] (quietly laughing). Manolo insulted him again, and hung up.|$|R
2500|$|Violent Sneezers – Dan {{recalled}} {{the story of}} former MLB pitcher Goose Gossage throwing out his back while sneezing. He then challenged <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> to name others {{in the world of}} sports that seem as if they would do the same. Dusty Rhodes seemed to be the only clear-cut consensus among Dan and the listeners. Mixed with popular songs, including House of Pain's Jump Around, was a sound bite of Fake Dusty Rhodes proclaiming with his trademark lisp and Southern accent, [...] "I'm a violent sneeza!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Callers {{from these}} {{locations}} are not uncommon, especially {{as some of}} the on-air staffers have backgrounds in those regions (Bob Heussler does radio play-by-play for the Connecticut Sun, Fairfield Stags basketball and has done radio play-by-play for UConn basketball and football, while Chris Carlin handles Rutgers football games). Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> listen to the streaming internet feed on WFAN's website, using either the Radio.com or TuneIn Radio apps for iPhone and iPad, or watch one of the station's TV simulcasts ("Mike Francesa" [...] on Fox Sports 1 and 2 or [...] "Boomer and Carton" [...] on CBS Sports Network).|$|E
2500|$|The Dare Show – A show {{hosted by}} {{a girl named}} Sharon (played by Amanda Bynes) and her younger brother, Toby (played by Drake Bell), who claim they will accept and perform any dare, but always renege on their promise when the disgusting and/or humiliating nature of the caller's dare becomes known. The caller then taunts them for this, after which Sharon or Toby cave, perform the dare, and say [...] "I cannot believe I just did that!" [...] Their mother (Nancy Sullivan) would then come in to stop the show, only {{to go through what}} they just did. <b>The</b> <b>callers</b> are said to come from a city in the wrong place (such as New York, North Dakota and Barcelona, Alabama).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>caller</b> tells Stu that he {{has tested}} two {{previous}} individuals who have done wrong deeds {{in a similar manner}} (one was a pedophile, the other was a company insider who cashed out his stock options before the share price collapsed), giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged, but in both cases, they refused and were killed. To demonstrate <b>the</b> threat, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> fires a suppressed sniper rifle at a toy robot sold by a nearby vendor; the damage is unseen by anyone but Stu, <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> and <b>the</b> vendor. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> demands that Stu confess his feelings for Pam to both Kelly and Pam to avoid being killed. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> contacts Pam, and puts her on line with Stu, who reveals that he is married. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then hangs up, telling Stu to call Kelly himself.|$|R
50|$|The {{operator}} {{will then}} transfer {{the call to}} the appropriate service's own call-taker. If <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> is unsure as to which service they require, the operator will default the call to the police, and if an incident requires more than one service, for instance a road traffic accident with injuries and trapped people, depending on <b>the</b> service <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> has chosen, this service will alert the other services for <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> (while <b>the</b> operator has to also contact each emergency service individually, regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> has remained on <b>the</b> line). <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> will {{be connected to the}} service which covers the area that they are (or appear to be) calling from.|$|R
50|$|The system determines <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> {{location}} {{based on}} the telephone exchange or cell tower they are connected to, and automatically connects them to the police force covering that area, unless <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> chooses otherwise. In some cases, some people may be given an option of choosing from multiple forces, if they are close to a boundary. If <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> would {{like to speak to}} a different police force to the one(s) determined by the automated system, they are prompted to verbally choose, by speaking the name of the force they need, however major towns, cities, and counties will also be accepted, with <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> being redirected to the police force that covers that area. If the system is still unable to determine the correct force, then <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> will be transferred to a national human operator who will determine this instead, and then connect <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to <b>the</b> appropriate force.|$|R
