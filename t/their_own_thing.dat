25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E

[...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, [...] "It's almost as if [...] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration.

500|$|Dixon {{has often}} cited Madonna as an influence, saying [...] "Madonna {{is a big}} idol. I loved her when I {{was a young girl}} and I feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking about}} at the time...

500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{identified}} the songs [...] "Only in 3's", [...] "Fortunately Gone", and [...] "Doe" [...] {{as being more}} benign and friendly-sounding than the Pixies' work; Matt LeMay of Pitchfork described [...] "Doe", [...] "Iris", and [...] "Oh!" [...] as possessing a beautiful, surprisingly gripping quality. [...] "Oh!" [...] has a slow tempo, restrained drumming, a sad violin performance by Carrie Bradley, and raw singing by Deal, while [...] "Opened", [...] "Limehouse", and [...] "Hellbound" [...] each contain a buoyant rhythm. About [...] "Hellbound", musician Sasha Alcott wrote in The Boston Herald that the song [...] "rides the edge between sweet and delicate frivolity and a fierce head-banging head-banging sing-a-long ... The guitar, drums and bass are all doing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> to build up and then slam into the refrain."

500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat.

Veer noted that he was not upset with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: [...] "I seriously think this is perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." [...] Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from Autumn Leaves, and wrote that [...] "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> for Far Harbor. ...

I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E

We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on."

I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that.

2500|$|Minor Threat's {{influence}} is still obvious in tracks like [...] "Face to Face," [...] but The Faith definitely had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>thing</b> going on. For one thing, Alec's voice is totally spiteful, {{and the slow}} songs really have a darkness that no other D.C. band came near to. His intense vocals were what really set them apart from any of their hardcore contemporaries.

Now she’s using the men and treating them badly...she's never felt settled. Her mother died, her father was abusive and she doesn't even know him. She's never felt like she's fitted in. Clare's 'mystery' is brought about by her looking for that father figure and needing that kind of attention, which then leads her into preying on the men of Walford. That's how she makes her money.
