5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the Early Dynastic period III (earlier than 2500 BC), Mari was rebuilt and populated again. The new city kept many of the first city exterior features, including the internal rampart and gate. Also kept was the outer circular embankment measuring 1.9km in diameter, which was topped by a wall that is <b>two</b> <b>meters</b> thick, which is suitable for the protection of archers.|$|E
5|$|Period Brak E {{witnessed}} {{the building of}} the city's walls, and Tell Brak expansion beyond the mound to form a lower town. By the late 5th millennium BC, Tell Brak reached the size of c. 55 hectares. Area TW of the tell (Archaeologists divided Tell Brak into areas designated with Alphabetic letters. See the map for Tell Brak's areas) revealed the remains of a monumental building with <b>two</b> <b>meters</b> thick walls and a basalt threshold. In front of the building, a sherd paved street was discovered, leading to the northern entrance of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Pairan aliens were {{designed}} by the prominent avant-garde artist Tarō Okamoto, which used a single eye that is common among science fiction aliens. Although official film posters showed the Pairan aliens towering over buildings, the actual cinematic version of the aliens were {{on the scale of}} humans, at about <b>two</b> <b>meters.</b> Walt Lee reports that Gentaro Nakajima's novel, on which this film was based, was in turn based on the Japanese folktale Kaguya-hime. The film was one of fourteen Japanese color pictures produced in early 1956, but the first color Japanese science-fiction film.|$|E

5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly <b>two</b> <b>meters</b> of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iwa {{produced}} estimated gusts reaching 120mph (193km/h) across Kauai and Oahu. The {{acceleration of}} the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near {{the path of the}} center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (<b>two</b> <b>meters)</b> on the south coast of Kauai. There, the surge reached 900feet (275m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33inches (516mm) was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. Waves on the coast of Oahu reached 16.4feet in height (3m), and waves on southern Kauai surpassed 30feet (9m) in height.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of <b>two</b> <b>meters,</b> to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|On {{the roof}} of the ten-story {{building}} are fifty small rooms (one for each apartment), no more than <b>two</b> <b>meters</b> by <b>two</b> <b>meters</b> in area, which were originally used as storage areas and not as living quarters for human beings, but after wealthy residents began moving from downtown Cairo to suburbs such as Medinet Nasr and Mohandessin in the 1970s, the rooms were gradually taken over by overwhelmingly poor migrants from the Egyptian countryside, arriving in Cairo in the hopes of finding employment. The rooftop community, effectively a slum neighborhood, is symbolic of the urbanization of Egypt and of the burgeoning population growth in its large cities in recent decades, especially among the poor and working classes.|$|E
50|$|Repeaters {{are found}} {{mainly in the}} VHF six <b>meters</b> (50—54 MHz), <b>two</b> <b>meter</b> (144—148 MHz), 1.25-meter band (1 1/4 meter) (220—224 MHz) and the UHF 70 {{centimeter}} (420—450 MHz) bands, but {{can be used on}} almost any frequency pair above 28 MHz. Recently, 33 centimeters (902—928 MHz) and 23 centimeters (1,240—1,300 MHz) are also being used for repeaters. Note that different countries have different rules; for example, in the United States, the <b>two</b> <b>meter</b> band is 144—148 MHz, while in the United Kingdom (and most of Europe) it is 144—147 MHz.|$|R
