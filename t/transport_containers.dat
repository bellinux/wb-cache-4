40|$|We {{describe}} a diagnostic specimen <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> that {{is appropriate for}} limited resource or emergency settings. The <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> is constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plumbing pipe, which is readily available and inexpensive (US$ 1 - 2, depending on size) and has wide flexibility of size due to the range of PVC pipe dimensions available. The PVC transporters are durable, water-resistant and may be easily decontaminated. They have been adapted for the transport of blood culture bottles from provincial hospitals in Laos, where, during a 2 -year period, 380 PVC tubes containing blood culture bottles were transported without any leakage or breakage. We have found the PVC transporter to be a useful and cost-efficient durable alternative that meets IATA Packing Instruction 650 biological <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> requirements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{experimental}} set-up dedicated to non-destructively test a 15 cm-long Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel rod by neutron radiography (NR) is described. It {{consists of three}} parts: <b>transport</b> <b>container,</b> imaging block and steel support. The design of the <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> was optimized with Monte-Carlo Simulation by the MCNP code. The material for the shell of the <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> was chosen to be lead with the thickness of 13 cm. Also, the mechanical devices were designed to control fuel rod movement inside the container. The imaging block was designed as the exposure platform, with three openings for the neutron beam, neutron converter foil, and specimen. Development and application of this experimental set-up will help gain much experience for investigating the actual irradiated fuel rod by neutron radiography at CARR in the future...|$|R
