5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} they had returned, the attack began. Indian warriors set fire to several houses and stables, but a {{favorable}} wind kept <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> from spreading. Children used the water drawn by the women to put out <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> began almost immediately, with {{plants such as}} fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, a real fire {{breaks out}} {{elsewhere}} in the town. The firemen ignore an inhabitant of the burning building {{as he tries to}} alert them to <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> first by activating <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> alarm, then by phoning <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station, and then by going to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station in person. Eventually, a fireman (Chaplin), alerts <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> chief and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> company goes to put out <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> Board oversees <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{department}} and has final approval of annual budgets, hiring and firing, expenditures not previously budgeted, and future planning. <b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> Board shall consist of five members. The Town Council appoints two citizen members, the Middle Township Trustee appoints two citizen members, and <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Department appoints one. <b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> Department {{is housed in}} one station on Main Street in Pittsboro. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> chief shall oversee <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Department and is appointed by <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Board. There are twelve full-time firefighters and about twenty reserve firefighters. <b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> Department protects about thirty five square miles in Pittsboro and Middle Township. They provide fire suppression, auto extrication, ambulance service, and fire prevention services.|$|R

5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped {{millions of gallons of}} water on <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent}} of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{fire safety}} was a {{function}} of local authorities rather than <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> service however in 1947 the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Services Act gave <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Brigades their first responsibilities for <b>fire</b> safety. <b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> Precautions Act 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 and <b>the</b> Regulatory Reform (<b>Fire</b> Safety) Order 2005 gave more powers to the service.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> {{protection}} regulation for {{the nuclear}} power plants is based on <b>the</b> qualitative <b>fire</b> hazard assessment and <b>the</b> quantitative <b>fire</b> risk analysis, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> risk is managed by <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> protection plan with the appropriate balance among <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> prevention, <b>fire</b> suppression and <b>the</b> minimization of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> effect.

5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowstone {{fires of}} 1988 {{together}} formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread {{out of control}} with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large conflagration, which burned for several months. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel {{for the first time}} in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> to an end. A total of , or 36percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic {{efforts by the}} ship's crew to contain <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin cleaning up the turret. The cleanup involved removing {{the bodies of the}} deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Between 28 July and 30 July 2012 multi-agency fire crews {{worked on}} <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> line as <b>the</b> blaze {{continued}} to grow. On 29 July, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> covered to 5000 acre. Late that afternoon, a leadership {{team from the}} South Central Oregon Fire Management Partnership arrived to oversee <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> suppression effort. By 30 July, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> had grown to 8100 acre. It was estimated that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was 20 percent contained and there were 232 personnel working on <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire fighters conducted burn out operations along <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> line and roadways.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> {{started in}} a shed to the {{northeast}} of the church. Heavy winds caused <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to spread to the roof area of the church. Inside <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> spread throughout <b>the</b> enclosed attic area. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> was noticed by {{a police officer in}} neighboring Samson Park, and he reported to his dispatcher. The dispatcher then notified <b>the</b> Samson Park <b>fire</b> department under <b>the</b> impression that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was in their jurisdiction. At the same time a Lake Worth water department worker noticed <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and notified his dispatcher who in turn notified <b>the</b> Lake Worth <b>fire</b> department.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{competing}} <b>fire</b> {{departments of}} Williamsport made the situation (WHOMEVER WROTE THIS NEEDS TO FIX THIS SENTENCE-SOME WORD, OR WORDS, ARE MISSING RIGHT IN HERE) surrounding <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> various <b>fire</b> departments competed {{with each other}} for the honor of fighting <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and <b>the</b> money that went with successfully putting <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> out. They competed for access to the hydrants, and even fought one another for the water that was needed to fight <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> raged around them and spread over many city blocks.|$|R
5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E

50|$|On June 26, 2012, Colorado Springs {{experienced}} {{a record high}} temperature of , which aided <b>the</b> <b>fire's</b> rapid expansion through Queen's Canyon and creating significant smoke. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> crested Queen's Canyon and winds from the west nearing 65 mph gusts (the cyclonic winds of the collapsing pyrocumulus cloud from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> storm) pushed <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> down <b>the</b> slope and into the Mountain Shadows, Oak Valley Ranch, and Peregrine neighborhoods. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> moved about 2 miles per hour towards the city. Embers were carried by the wind to a distance of up to a quarter mile away and caused multiple small spot fires of brush and low vegetation. Once <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> crossed into neighborhoods, the fuel for <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was houses, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> spread house-to-house.|$|R
50|$|Wind {{speed and}} land slope, like a {{mountain}} where <b>the</b> Beaver Creek <b>Fire</b> took place, influences <b>fire</b> behavior, specifically <b>the</b> spread of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Wind makes fire grow faster. As wind speed increase, {{the spread of}} <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> increases more quickly and can help increase the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire can even create some of its own wind to disperse the heat downward {{from the heart of}} the flame to the unburnt fuel ahead of <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> which helps in the rate of spread of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and increases <b>the</b> longevity of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Some argue that the increase in the spread rate of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> from <b>the</b> windy conditions {{has to do with the}} increased oxygen supply in <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Others argue that this is not true because of <b>the</b> fact that <b>fires</b> need a sufficient amount of oxygen to even start. Without wind, it is easier to stop a <b>fire</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> not being pushed forward. Slope of land increases <b>the</b> spread of <b>fire</b> only and not the intensity. The reason for this is gravity pushes <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> down so that the area in front of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> is heated up quicker and able to burn faster allowing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to burn more area in a period of time up a slope, even without wind, than just on flat ground.|$|R

5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E
