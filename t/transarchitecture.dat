50|$|<b>Transarchitecture,</b> a term {{coined by}} Markos Novak, is {{the branch of}} {{architectural}} design that embraces and explores: the bridging between virtual and material spaces, computerized and robotic manufacturing and construction techniques, interactivity and communication through media technologies, and computer based conceptualization and modeling processes. -David Nelson Rose.|$|E
5000|$|At its peak, Starlab {{employed}} over 130 {{scientists from}} thirty-six nationalities. Starlab projects included intelligent clothing, stem cell research, emotics, <b>transarchitecture,</b> robotics, theoretical physics, e.g., {{the possibility of}} time travel, consciousness, quantum computation, quantum information, art, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, new media, biophysics, materials science, protein folding, nanoelectronics, and wearable computing. These research lines were grouped under the acronym [...] "BANG," [...] Bits, Atoms, Neurons, Genes. The lab sponsored and collaborated with other labs and organized several international conferences and open research symposia.|$|E
40|$|Some {{recent work}} in {{architecture}} {{has begun to}} think through the implications of an electronically mediated environment - {{both in terms of}} new forms of spaces and of changes to existing ones. New possibilities are read as resulting from these new technologies {{not only in terms of}} shaping buildings but also in terms of new ways of thinking about existing buildings. This paper traces the work of architects, such as Marcos Novak, who have used this opportunity to think through post-Euclidean architecture, his <b>TransArchitecture.</b> Mike Crang outlines the case made for seeing space as fluid, folded in complex dimensions and eventful. However, such an approach raises political questions about what a plural city might look like. This is explored through the ideas of Lebbeus Woods to suggest that instability of structure may be linked to a progressive politics. City shape, it is suggested, should be thought of a morphology, a logic of changing and transmission, rather than a static shape...|$|E
