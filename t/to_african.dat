5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection <b>to</b> <b>African</b> gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the cathedral}} premiered its own record label with a {{recording}} called Majestas. The music {{focuses on the}} new cathedral organ and the Llandaff Cathedral choir. The recording's title {{was taken from the}} Jacob Epstein sculpture in the cathedral's nave {{that was part of the}} post-war renewal of the structure. Proceeds from sales of the record were donated <b>to</b> <b>African</b> charities.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited <b>to</b> <b>African</b> climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{flow and}} {{admixture}} {{can also have}} an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders.

5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send <b>to</b> <b>African</b> countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights <b>to</b> <b>African</b> American men while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique <b>to</b> <b>African</b> American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights <b>to</b> <b>African</b> Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal <b>to</b> <b>African</b> Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Brown {{served as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976.

5|$|In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation {{was created}} at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide {{postgraduate}} scholarships <b>to</b> <b>African</b> students.

The host nation won the most gold medals, with 28, and the United States won the most total medals with 74. Rhodesia competed at these Games, winning 12 medals, but did not take part at the 1972 Summer Olympics after their invitation was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee, {{four days before the}} opening ceremony, in response <b>to</b> <b>African</b> countries' protests against the Rhodesian regime.

Kyla helps Abra cover up an illegal xenotransplantation he performed, and keeps quiet when she discovers he has been stealing and shipping returned anti-retroviral drugs <b>to</b> <b>African</b> hospitals in need.

The nearby hub of Bronzeville at 47th and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (known as King Drive and formerly Grand Boulevard) was a cultural {{center of the}} rising ghetto that fostered a cultural identity. In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted <b>to</b> <b>African</b> American institutions. The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973.

The museum's model has been emulated in numerous other cities around the country, including Boston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>African</b> Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity â€“ a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today.

5|$|While {{there was}} no {{accompanying}} political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government they were nationalized in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized <b>to</b> <b>African</b> leaders for the historical enslavement of Africans by the Arab slave trade.|$|E
