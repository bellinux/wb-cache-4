40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{evaluating}} the contribution of <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in the screening for prostate neoplasias and in the guidance of prostate biopsies. Materials and Methods: Prospective study developed over a one-year period. All the patients with indication for prostate biopsy were evaluated. Regardless of PSA values, the patients underwent ultrasound {{in order to identify}} suspicious nodules (confirmed by two observers). Sextant biopsy was subsequently performed. In cases of finding suspicious nodules, an additional puncture directed to such nodules was done. Results: In a total of 155 cases the prevalence of malignancy was of 53 %. Suspicious nodules were detected in 34 patients, and 25 where malignant (positive predictive value of 74 %). The specificity and sensitivity for suspicious nodules were 88 % and 31 % respectively. Comparatively with the randomly obtained sextant specimens, the rate of findings of neoplasia was higher in the specimens obtained with puncture directed to the nodule (p = 0. 032). No statistically significant difference was observed in the Gleason score for both types of specimens (p = 0. 172). Conclusion: The high positive predictive value and the high rate of findings of neoplasia in specimens of suspicious nodules should be taken into consideration in the future. The authors suggest a biopsy technique similar to the one described in the present study (sextant biopsy plus puncture directed to the suspicious nodule) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the predictive factors of prostate volume (PV) by analyzing potential predictors in a population of middle-aged men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and use a prediction model for PV estimation to compare with digital rectal examination (DRE) alone. Materials and methodsPatients between the ages of 40 years and 64 years who underwent <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> as part of a self-paid medical check-up were enrolled. Participant demographics, medical history, and voiding symptoms were assessed by the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire. A multiple linear regression with stepwise selection was used to analyze the correlations between PV and all potential predictors. ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-eight men with bothersome LUTS (IPSS >  7) were enrolled as study participants at a mean age of 56. 4 years. Patients with PV > 25  mL were significantly older and had higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and scores for total IPSS, storage, urgency items, and nocturia items. DRE, serum PSA, age, and urgency score were independent predictors for PV, especially for men with PV > 25  mL, for which the standardized regression equation was PV =  0. 74  × (DRE estimation)  +  0. 10  × (age)  +  0. 12  × (serum PSA)  +  0. 079  × (urgency score) (adjusted R 2  =  0. 80). ConclusionIn the current study, we confirmed that serum PSA, age, and urgency score are significant predictors of PV. The prediction model including DRE, PSA, age, and urgency score was a better method to estimate PV than DRE alone, especially for men with a larger prostate (PV >  25  mL) ...|$|R

25|$|Urinalysis is {{typically}} performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate {{for signs of}} a urinary tract infection, glucose in the urine (suggestive of diabetes), or protein in the urine (suggestive of kidney disease). Bloodwork including kidney function tests and prostate specific antigen (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively. However, checking blood PSA levels for prostate cancer screening is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or <b>prostate</b> cancer. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> of the testes, prostate, and kidneys is often performed, again to rule out cancer and hydronephrosis.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{define the}} role of total {{prostate}} (TP) volume, transition zone (TZ) volume, and age as determinants of the utility of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) -based diagnostic parameters for early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in a prospective multicenter study. Methods. The study participants were 974 consecutive men with serum total PSA (tPSA) levels of 4 to 10 ng/mL who were referred for early PCa detection or lower urinary tract symptoms. All patients underwent <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> and sextant biopsy with two additional TZ biopsies. In patients with negative initial biopsies, repeated biopsies were performed at 6 weeks. tPSA, the free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA), PSA density of the TZ (PSA-TZ), PSA density (PSAD), and PSA velocity (PSAV) were determined and compared across TP volume strata of 30 cm 3 or less and greater than 30 cm 3, TZ volume strata of 20 cm 3 or less and greater than 20 cm 3, and various age groups to evaluate the need for volume and/or age-specific reference ranges. Results. PCa was found in 345 (35. 4 %) of 974 patients and benign prostatic tissue was found in 629 (64. 6 %) of 947 patients. Across TP volume strata, significantly higher values of tPSA (P < 0. 01), PSA-TZ, PSAD (P < 0. 001), and PSAV (P < 0. 05) and lower values of f/t PSA (P < 0. 001) were observed in patients with PCa than in those without PCa. Similar results were obtained with respect to TZ volume strata, except {{in the case of}} PSAV (P < 0. 05). tPSA, PSA-TZ, and PSAD were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in patients with PCa than in those without PCa for all corresponding age ranges. In patients with PCa, f/t PSA was significantly lower (P < 0. 001) within the same age ranges. Within each group (PCa or benign), f/t PSA, PSAD, PSA-TZ, and PSAV values were unaffected by age strata. However, PSA parameters dependent on prostate volume (PSAD, PSA-TZ) were statistically lower (P < 0. 001) in prostates with a higher TP volume (greater than 30 cm 3) and TZ volume (greater than 20 cm 3); f/t PSA values were unaffected by TP and TZ volumes. Conclusions. f/t PSA and PSA-TZ were the most powerful parameters to differentiate between benign prostatic tissue and PCa. f/t PSA was the sole parameter unaffected by age and prostate volume. We believe new volume-specific cutpoints, as presented in the current study, should be employed when using PSAD and PSA-TZ for the early detection of PCa.

40|$|Abstract—Automatic <b>prostate</b> {{segmentation}} in <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (TRUS) {{images is}} highly desired in many clinical applications. However, robust and automated prostate segmentation is challenging {{due to the}} low SNR in TRUS and the missing boundaries in shadow areas caused by calcifications or hyperdense prostate tissues. This paper presents a novel method of utilizing a priori shapes estimated from partial contours for segmenting the prostate. The proposed method is able to automatically extract prostate boundary from 2 -D TRUS images without user interaction for shape correction in shadow areas. During the segmentation process, missing boundaries in shadow areas are estimated by using a partial active shape model, which takes partial contours as input but returns a complete shape estimation. With this shape guidance, an optimal search is performed by a discrete deformable model to minimize an energy functional for image segmentation, which is achieved efficiently by using dynamic programming. The segmentation of an image is executed in a multiresolution fashion from coarse to fine for robustness and computational efficiency. Promising segmentation results were demonstrated on 301 TRUS images grabbed from 19 patients with the average mean absolute distance error of 2. 01 mm ± 1. 02 mm.

Various types of anaesthetic methods have been used. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and complication rate between periprostatic lidocaine infiltration and transrectal lidocaine gel in <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. All prostate biopsy patients were included except those with lidocaine, allergy, haemorrhagic diathesis, anticoagulation therapy, the inability to rate a visual analogue scale and inability to obtain consent. They were randomized into two groups. Group 1 received 20 ml 2 % transrectal lidocaine gel. Group 2 received 5 ml 1 % lidocaine infiltration for each periprostatic nerve block with 23 -gauge spinal needle. After three minutes, prostate biopsy was performed with an 18 gauge 7 -inch spring-loaded biopsy gun. Six biopsies were taken for each lobe. Pain during probe insertion, biopsy and immediately after the procedure was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale. Any complication immediately after procedure, one day or after one week, was recorded. Mean pain score was lower after periprostatic lidocaine infiltration compared to transrectal lidocaine gel (3. 1 + 1. 9 versus 4. 9 + 2. 4, p = 0. 027).

We tested the efficacy {{and safety of}} combined perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block during <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 280 patients were randomized to receive combined perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block (group 1), perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream alone (group 2), periprostatic nerve block alone (group 3) or no anesthesia (group 4) before <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Pain was evaluated with a 10 -point visual analog scale at subsequent procedural steps, including perianal-intrarectal substance administration, <b>prostate</b> <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> periprostatic nerve block and sampling. Complications were assessed by self-administered questionnaire and telephone interview. RESULTS: The groups were comparable in patient age, prostate volume, pathology results and visual analog scale perianal-intrarectal substance administration. Visual analog scale results for transrectal ultrasound were lower in groups 1 and 2 vs 3 and 4 (mean 1. 5 and 1. 41 vs 5. 37 and 5. 31, p < 0. 001) and results for periprostatic nerve block were lower in group 1 vs 3 (mean 1. 03 vs 3. 74, p < 0. 001). Results for sampling were lower in groups 1 to 3 vs 4 (mean 0. 77, 1. 27 and 1. 27 vs 4. 33, p < 0. 001) and in group 1 vs 2 and 3 (p < 0. 001). Stratified analysis showed that visual analog scale sampling was lower in group 1 vs 2 and 3 in patients 65 years old or younger, those with a prostate greater than 49 cc and those with lower anorectal compliance (visual analog scale results for perianal-intrarectal substance administration greater than 2) (p = 0. 006, < 0. 001 and 0. 003, respectively).

We investigated the addition of intravenous (iv) piperacillin/tazobactam immediately prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis to determine if it would decrease the incidence of serious infectious complications after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. Group 1 patients were a historic control of 197 patients who underwent <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Group 2 patients, 104 patients, received standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and the addition of a single dose of iv piperacillin/tazobactam 30 minutes prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There were ten serious bacterial infectious complications in group 1 patients. No patients in group 2 developed serious bacterial infections after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There was approximately a 5 % incidence of serious bacterial infection in group 1 patients.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and risk {{factors associated with}} acute prostatitis after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 923 transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsies of the prostate in 878 patients performed at our institution from June 2004 to May 2009. The indications for biopsy were generally serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation, abnormal findings on a digital rectal examination, or both. All biopsies were performed with the patient hospitalized except for 10 patients who refused to be hospitalized, and ciprofloxacin was administered as an antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and potential risk factors associated with acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy were evaluated. Results: Acute prostatitis developed in 18 (2. 0 %) cases after prostate biopsy. Among them, 9 (1. 0 %) had bacteremia and 2 (0. 2 %) showed clinical features of sepsis. Of the total 50 urine or blood specimens sent for culture study, 27 (54. 0 %) specimens showed positive cultures, including E. coli in 25. Among the 27 culture-positive specimens, 26 (96. 3 %) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Among the potential risk factors for acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy, biopsy performed as an outpatient procedure without a cleansing enema (p= 0. 001) and past history of cerebrovascular accident (p= 0. 048) were statistically significant.

The theoretical part focuses on {{the description of the}} prostate carcinoma, which is the second most frequent malignity in men. It describes the risk factors of the illness that may have influence on the development of prostate carcinoma, and the symptoms that the illness manifests itself by. Further, it describes the fundamental diagnostic methods and prevention measures. Of the diagnostic methods, a more detailed analysis is made of transrectal ultrasonography connected with prostate biopsy. The theoretical part also describes the nursing care of patients who undergo <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy. The nurse {{is an integral part of}} the care of these patients, not only before and during the performance but also after it...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transurethral}} microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) with Prostatron {{in patients with}} benign prostatic hypertrophy was investigated. Two hundred and one patients were treated between January 1991 and June 1992 after informed consent was signed. The following examinations were carried out at screening: interview (including symptoms score evaluation), physical examination (including digital rectal examination), haematology and blood chemistry (including prostate specific antigen), ECG, chest Xray, kidney, bladder and <b>prostate</b> (<b>transrectal)</b> <b>ultrasound</b> sonography (USS) and uroflowmetry; pressure-flow study was performed in a selected group of patients. All enrolled patients had Madsen symptom score > or = 8; peak flow rate < or = 15 ml/s and post void residual urine < or = 200 ml. Patients with obstructive middle lobe of the prostate, any BPH complication or any suspicion of prostatic carcinoma {{were excluded from the}} study. Microwave thermotherapy with Prostatron was carried out according to software generation 2. 0 (Prostasoft 2. 0), the c 10 (black) catheter was used in all patients. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months after microwave thermotherapy. Overall short- and long-term morbidity rates were 6. 09 and 2. 73 per cent, respectively. At 12 months, Madsen score was found to be reduced from 11. 7 +/- 4. 78 to 4. 43 +/- 3. 30; maximum flow rate (Qmax) was increased from 8. 91 +/- 4. 20 to 13. 20 +/- 4. 86; post void residual urine (PVRU) was reduced from 131 +/- 17. 6 to 67. 40 +/- 34. 50.

40|$|Objective: We {{retrospective}} {{reviewed the}} cases of <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy (TRUSPBX) at out-patient department for the relation between febrile urinary tract rate and regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis. Materials and methods: Cases of TRUSPBX at out-patient department since January 2005 –December 2013 were reviewed. Relevant data before biopsy was collected. Results: Totally 689 patients {{with a mean age}} of 66 years were included for analysis. Among them, 584 cases had single dose of levofloxacin 500  mg as prophylaxis (group 1) and 105 cases had multiple doses/types of prophylactic antibiotics (group 2) were enrolled. The mean age, number of biopsy core, PSA level, total prostate volume, and cancer rate were comparable between groups. Postoperative fever occurred in 4 (0. 68 %) patients of group 1 and none of group 2 (p =  0. 9). Conclusion: Single dose quinolone prophylaxis for out-patient <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy may be applicable in Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} cancer for men and the second cause of cancer death. Confirmation of cancer re-quires <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsies. Tracking systems for <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsies {{make it possible to}} generate biopsy distribution maps for intra- and post-interventional quality control, 3 D visualisation of histological results for treatment planning, and to guide clinicians toward non-ultrasound (US) targets. In this paper, a 3 D US based tracking system for fast and accurate estimation of nonlinear prostate tissue deformation is proposed. Linear elasticity and inverse consistency a priori models are used to improve performance. A variant of the SSD image distance measure is proposed for filtering of local intensity shifts, which are frequent in US images. System accuracy was evaluated to 0. 83 ± 0. 54 mm using point fiducial on 295 US volumes from 18 patients.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: After {{prostate}} biopsy, {{serious and}} life-threatening infections of resistant strains can develop and therefore fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis is widely used. This study aimed to examine infections in patients undergoing <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy with quinolone prophylaxis and {{to review the}} articles reported in this respect. Patients and Methods: In this study, 14 cases who followed {{for the development of}} infection after <b>transrectal</b> ultrasonography guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy between the years 2005 - 2010 at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology of Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Ten patients (% 71. 4) developed sepsis, 3 patients (21. 4 %) urinary tract infection (UTI), and 1 patient (7. 1 %) acute bacterial prostatitis. In seven out of 14 patients (50 %) bacteria growth was in blood culture, in 12 patients (85. 7 %) was in urine and in 5 patients (35. 7 %) was in both. E. coli was identified as the causative agent in all of the cases being the rate of extended spectrum of -lactamases (ESBL) in E. coli strains was 42. 8 %, quinolone resistance 92. 8 %. Conclusion: This study suggested that fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli should be considered as an important causative agent in infections after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy...|$|R

40|$|PurposeThere is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} on the clinical efficacy and safety of the photoselective vaporization (PVP) of the prostate using the 180 W lithium triborate (LBO) laser. We report on initial outcomes of PVP with the 180 W laser, comparig the first 50 cases with the last 50 cases performed with the 120 W LBO laser. MethodsAll cases performed by a single surgeon (HHW) have been prospectively maintained. The last 50 cases treated with the 120 W LBO laser (December 2009 to August 2010) were compared with the first 50 cases treated with the 180 W LBO (July 2010 to June 2011). Patient variables were recorded preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. Perioperative data was also recorded. ResultsThe 180 W cases had a larger median <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> volume (68 mL vs. 51 mL, P< 0. 05). For the 180 W and 120 W LBO lasers, total operating time was 64. 2 and 72. 5 minutes (not significant [NS] at P= 0. 22), lasering time 49. 6 and 54. 6 minutes (NS, P= 0. 30) and energy utilisation 477. 6 kJ and 377. 9 kJ (P< 0. 05) respectively. When compared per gram of prostate tissue lasered, the 180 W is quicker at 0. 67 min/g vs. 1. 0 min/g for the 120 W laser. Complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification included 5 grade 1 complications and 3 grade 3 b (bladder neck contractures) with the 180 W LBO laser. The 120 W LBO laser had 4 grade 1 complications and 1 grade 2. ConclusionsThere is little change in clinical outcomes with the transition from 120 W to 180 W LBO PVP with an already experienced PVP surgeon. The 180 W LBO laser appears to have impacted upon patient selection with significantly increased prostate size and associated with increased energy utilisation. There appears to be a trend toward shorter laser times...|$|R
