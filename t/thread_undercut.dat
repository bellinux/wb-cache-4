5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the <b>thread.</b> <b>Undercut</b> studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw <b>thread.</b> <b>Undercut</b> studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|E

Additives for weather resistance, flame retardation, or static elimination can be incorporated.Inserts, graphics, <b>threads,</b> handles, minor <b>undercuts,</b> flat surfaces without draft angles, or fine surface detail {{can be part}} of the design. Designs can also be multi-wall, either hollow or foam filled.|$|R
50|$|The {{allowable}} {{tensile force}} for a non-undercut threaded rod {{is defined by}} the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) as:where d is the nominal diameter and Fu is the ultimate tensile strength of the material. For <b>undercut</b> <b>threaded</b> rods the allowable tensile stress is defined as:where ds is the diameter of the shank and Fy is the yield strength of the material.|$|R
