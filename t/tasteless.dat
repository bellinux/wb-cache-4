5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and <b>tasteless</b> gas with the molecular formula , {{referred to as}} dioxygen.|$|E
5|$|Helium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, <b>tasteless,</b> non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, {{the first in}} the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen (H) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, <b>tasteless,</b> highly flammable diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. With an atomic mass of 1.00794amu, hydrogen is the lightest element.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} posited that Lavrenty Beria, Nikita Khrushchev and others conspired to use {{warfarin}} to poison Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Warfarin is <b>tasteless</b> and colourless, and produces symptoms {{similar to those}} that Stalin exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, <b>tasteless,</b> non-toxic, inert {{monatomic}} {{chemical element}} that heads the noble gas {{series in the}} periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are colorless, odorless, <b>tasteless,</b> and {{nonflammable}} under standard conditions. They were once labeled group0 in {{the periodic table}} because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine {{with those of other}} elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.|$|E
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} at the 1828 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the painting attracted large crowds, and strongly divided critical opinion. It was greatly praised by many critics, who counted it among the finest works {{of art in the}} country. Other reviewers condemned it as crude, <b>tasteless,</b> offensive and poorly executed.|$|E
5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and <b>tasteless.</b> A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|The odorless and <b>tasteless</b> {{thallium}} sulfate {{was once}} widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. Thallium salts {{were used in}} the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
5|$|While {{traditionally}} the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as <b>tasteless</b> and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a bargain price by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated The Sirens and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly <b>tasteless</b> led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work <b>tasteless</b> and offensive.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and <b>tasteless</b> diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it <b>tasteless.</b> It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the <b>tasteless</b> habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and <b>tasteless.</b> The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|While a few critics praised {{elements}} of its composition and execution, The Dawn of Love was very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty {{had developed a}} reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens {{as well as being}} overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered <b>tasteless</b> and obscene. The Dawn of Love was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often <b>tasteless,</b> was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
5|$|The site {{used for}} the Willard Whyte Space Labs (where Bond gets away in the Moon Buggy) was actually, at that time, a Johns-Manville gypsum plant located just outside Las Vegas. The home of Kirk Douglas was {{used for the}} scene in Tiffany's house, while the Elrod House in Palm Springs, {{designed}} by John Lautner, became Willard Whyte's house. The exterior shots of the Slumber mortuary were of the Palm Mortuary in Henderson, Nevada. The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios, where Ken Adam imitated the real building's lozenge-shaped stained glass window in its nave. During location filming, Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area, the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber mortuary (the use of <b>tasteless</b> Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps) came from these experiences. Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence, on 13 August 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, <b>tasteless,</b> non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and <b>tasteless.</b> It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
25|$|Simple ethers (such as diethyl ether) are <b>tasteless.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stomach {{hemorrhage}} {{is usually}} not caused by high blood pressure, but is, along with stroke, consistent with overdose of warfarin, a colourless, <b>tasteless,</b> anticoagulant drug.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>tasteless</b> date {{variety that}} has become dry while still being {{attached}} to the fruit bunch is called Karmush. Similar to Gau fruits Karmush dates are used as fodder.|$|E
25|$|An ongoing {{animated}} series, featuring controversial celebrities Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, and the Olsen {{twins in}} {{the roles of}} <b>tasteless</b> superheroes, was created in 2006 by Heavy.com. Both the setting {{and some of the}} girls' superpowers were plays on elements from Super Friends.|$|E
25|$|Some {{manufactured}} DHA is {{a vegetarian}} product extracted from algae, and it competes {{on the market}} with fish oil that contains DHA and other omega-3s such as EPA. Both fish oil and DHA are odorless and <b>tasteless</b> after processing as a food additive.|$|E
25|$|Starch or amylum is a {{polysaccharide}} {{produced by}} all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, <b>tasteless</b> and odourless powder. It {{consists of two}} types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.|$|E
25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and <b>tasteless</b> liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin).|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and <b>tasteless</b> {{gas that}} is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, {{although it is}} also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and {{is thought to have}} some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone.|$|E
25|$|The {{love of a}} {{good man}} was {{ultimately}} what redeemed Rachel. At a welcoming party thrown in his honor, Rachel crossed paths with wealthy publisher, Mac Cory (Douglass Watson). Originally, Mac was a love interest for Liz Matthews, but Lemay noticed the chemistry between Watson and Wyndham and wrote a love story for them. Fearing backlash from viewers who may have found an older man-younger woman relationship <b>tasteless,</b> Lemay penned chance encounters for the two characters, which led to innocent yet intimate conversations.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as <b>tasteless</b> and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water in their mouths, and frogs {{are known to be}} able to smell it. However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E
25|$|The {{breath test}} uses {{radioactive}} carbon to detect H. pylori. To perform this exam the person {{will be asked}} to drink a <b>tasteless</b> liquid which contains the carbon as part of the substance that the bacteria breaks down. After an hour, the person {{will be asked to}} blow into a bag that is sealed. If the person is infected with H. pylori, the breath sample will contain radioactive carbon dioxide. This test provides the advantage of being able to monitor the response to treatment used to kill the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground and}} leached acorn flour was then usually cooked into a <b>tasteless</b> mush. This {{was a very}} labor-intensive process nearly always done by {{the women in the}} tribe. There are {{estimates}} that some Indians might have eaten as much as one ton of acorns in one year. A major advantage of acorns is that they grew wild, could be easily gathered in large quantities, and could be easily stored over a winter for a reliable winter food source. Almost none of these Indian food supplies were in a typical European's diet.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is {{the most}} common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and <b>tasteless,</b> but highly toxic. It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin, which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 ppm may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin. A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.|$|E
25|$|Thallium, unlike gallium and indium, is {{extremely}} toxic, and has caused many poisoning deaths. Its most noticeable effect, apparent even from tiny doses, is hair loss {{all over the}} body, but it causes {{a wide range of}} other symptoms, disrupting and eventually halting the functions of many organs. The nearly colorless, odorless and <b>tasteless</b> nature of thallium compounds has led to their use by murderers. The incidence of thallium poisoning, intentional and accidental, increased when thallium (with its similarly toxic compound, thallium sulfate) was introduced to control rats and other pests. The use of thallium pesticides has therefore been prohibited since 1975 in many countries, including the USA.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect most gases {{that are likely to}} be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, odourless and <b>tasteless.</b> Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen analysers, helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen analysers are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of gas detection methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodical quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving air compressors.|$|E
