5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to {{the sole purpose of}} paying <b>that</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} Relief faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Much debt relief legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional, ensuring <b>that</b> <b>debt</b> relief would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing <b>that</b> <b>debt.</b> He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E

5|$|However, the Orioles {{struggled}} with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, {{reported that the}} team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford <b>that</b> <b>debt,</b> Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.|$|E

Unable to afford <b>that</b> <b>debt,</b> Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL.

That day, Freedman and Brush released McGinnity, McGraw, Kelley, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants. McGinnity attempted to contact Johnson that night, offering to stay with the Orioles if he could receive Johnson's personal assurance that he was welcome to stay. McGinnity did not hear back from Johnson, who had left his phone off the hook that night to avoid being contacted, and joined his teammates with the Giants.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution's other {{innovation}} was {{allowing the}} governor to veto laws passed by the legislature. That proved problematic in the following decades, since the first legislature after adoption of the Constitution adopted measures reaffirming Virginia's prewar debt, at those interest rates (much higher than postwar) and other favorable terms. Moreover, Virginia was much poorer after the war, and tax revenues were insufficient to fund <b>that</b> <b>debt.</b> Legislation refinancing <b>that</b> <b>debt</b> would be vetoed by conservative governors {{several times in the}} next decade.|$|E

40|$|We examine 242 NYSE/AMEX and OTC {{common stock}} offerings <b>that</b> reduce bank <b>debt</b> and 254 <b>that</b> retire nonbank <b>debt.</b> We {{discover}} <b>that</b> bank <b>debt</b> reductions {{are associated with}} negative announcement period stock returns that are {{more than twice the}} magnitude of the negative returns found for nonbank debt reductions. The significant difference in returns indicate bank debt reductions transmits negative information beyond that previously cited in the stock offering literature. Regression tests show that the explanatory variable representing bank debt signaling models best explains stock returns. █ Bankers are parties to information about a firm's financial condition through their special relationship as lenders. This premise is the basis for the predictions of bank debt signaling models, which posit <b>that</b> bank <b>debt</b> issuance announcements convey positive news about a firm. Empirical research on <b>debt</b> offering announcements <b>that</b> raise cash for multi-corporate purposes supports this claim. The research documents statistically significant positive stock price reactions to bank debt announcements and negative reactions to nonbank debt announcements. If bank debt issuance announcements signal more favorable news than nonbank debt announcements, it follows <b>that</b> bank <b>debt</b> reduction announcements should signal more negative news than nonbank debt reduction announcements. Market participants will view bank debt reduction announcements as the result of decisions made by bankers acting upon unfavorable inside information. Our study extends prior research on equity offerings <b>that</b> reduce <b>debt.</b> We analyze 242 stock offering announcements <b>that</b> reduce bank <b>debt,</b> and 254 announcements <b>that</b> retire nonbank <b>debt.</b> Consistent with the predictions of bank debt signaling models, returns for bank debt reductions are more negative than returns for nonbank debt reductions, and the differences in returns are statistically significant...|$|R

25|$|One {{incident}} {{illustrates the}} nature and tensions of the debate. The U.S. added $1.0 trillion to the national debt in fiscal year (FY) 2008, which ended in September 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected two weeks prior to Obama's first inauguration that the deficit in FY 2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of the Bush tax cuts as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if the Bush tax cuts were extended at all income levels. Adjusting other assumptions in the CBO baseline could have raised <b>that</b> <b>debt</b> level even higher.|$|E
25|$|These {{conflicts}} put {{an enormous}} {{strain on the}} resources of the Republic, however, and for that reason the Republic (like its opponent, the France of Louis XIV) was deeply in debt {{at the end of the}} War of the Spanish Succession. The regents of the Republic more or less abandoned its Great-Power pretensions after 1713, cutting down on its military preparedness in a vain attempt to pay down this overhang of public debt. <b>That</b> <b>debt</b> brought a significant rentier class into being that helped change the nature of the economy from one invested primarily in trade and industry into one in which a significant financial sector played a dominant role. By the end of the 18th century the Republic was the major market for sovereign debt, and a major source of foreign direct investment.|$|E
40|$|Executive {{compensation}} influences managerial risk preferences through executives' portfolio sensitivities {{to changes}} in stock prices (delta) and stock return volatility (vega). Large deltas discourage managerial risk-taking, while large vegas encourage risk-taking.

We posit and find evidence of a negative (positive) relation between CEO portfolio deltas (vegas) and short-maturity debt.

50|$|The usual {{argument}} against deficit spending, dating to Adam Smith, is that households should not run deficits—one should have money before one spends it, from prudence—and {{that what is}} correct for a household is correct for a nation and its government.

25|$|Debt {{levels may}} affect {{economic}} growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported {{that among the}} 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, {{there was no evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>debt</b> above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, {{rather than the other way}} around.|$|E
