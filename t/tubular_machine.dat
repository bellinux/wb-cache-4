40|$|The {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of common, solid (non-laminated) ferromagnetic materials are widely available, but the electro-magnetic characteristics of such solid materials are often undefined. Existing characterization procedures {{such as the}} toroidal ring sample test method are capable of mapping the electro-magnetic properties of solid materials quite accurately when investigating materials {{to be used in}} conventional magnetic circuits, i. e. where the flux paths and induced eddy currents follow the more common ‘radial’ characteristics as in a standard rotating machine. When solid ferromagnetic material is employed in unconventional machine structures, such as for transverse flux <b>machines</b> or <b>tubular</b> linear <b>machines,</b> simple toroidal test methods do not accurately represent the flux conditions in the stator material. In this paper a new testing method is proposed to accurately impose the correct flux conditions for <b>tubular</b> linear <b>machines.</b> The proposed method uses a simple experimental test setup to characterize the magnetic properties of solid, ferro-magnetic material.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{renewable}} energy, ocean wave energy {{is one of the}} least commercialised resources. This is mainly attributable to the harsh environment and the technical requirements of the environment. In recent years, a vast array of new technologies have been developed for this application. Of these, some have considered the oscillatory action of the ocean waves conducive to the use of linear generators in direct-drive actuators. Linear generators may be classi ed into either tubular machines, which encapsulate the magnetic ux very well, or single- and double-sided at machines. Double-sided at layouts exhibit very high force capabilities {{because of the presence of}} a second air-gap. A Double-Sided <b>Tubular</b> <b>machine</b> is proposed which exhibits the force density of a doublesided at machine combined with the superior ux e ciency of a <b>tubular</b> <b>machine.</b> The hypothesis of the present research is that this new layout will accentuate these bene ts beyond the potential of the double-sided at linear machine layout.

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen a {{considerable}} amount of research and development effort dedicated to linear machines. An important family of linear machines is the tubular, permanent magnet synchronous motor. As for any other machine, such motors are usually developed with laminated cores aimed at reducing core losses. However, for tubular machines, such a configuration requires cores laminated in the axial direction, making for quite expensive and time-consuming manufacturing processes. To address this aspect, this thesis proposes and investigates the use of solid materials for the core structure of the stator of a <b>tubular</b> <b>machine.</b> The journey to achieve this goal is presented in this thesis. It is shown how through the use of new material characterisation techniques (critical for understanding and modelling structures operating in unconventional magnetic circuits) and new eddy current reduction methods (proposed and validated on representative samples), excellent results in terms of manufacturing costs can be achieved without compromising a machine’s performance.

40|$|The {{direct drive}} point {{absorber}} is a robust and efficient system for wave energy harvesting, where the linear generator represents {{the most complex}} part of the system. Therefore, its design and optimization are crucial tasks. The tubular shape of a linear generator’s magnetic circuit offers better permanent magnet flux encapsulation and reduction in radial forces on the translator due to its symmetry. A double stator topology can improve the power density of the linear <b>tubular</b> <b>machine.</b> Common designs employ a set of aligned stators {{on each side of}} a translator with radially magnetized permanent magnets. Such designs require doubling the amount of permanent magnet material and lead to an increase in the cogging force. The design presented in this thesis utilizes a translator with buried axially magnetized magnets and axially shifted positioning of the two stators such that no additional magnetic material, compared to single side machine, is required. In addition to the conservation of magnetic material, a significant improvement in the cogging force occurs in the two phase topology, while the double sided three phase system produces more power at the cost of a small increase in the cogging force. The analytical and the FEM models of the generator are described and their results compared to the experimental results. In general, the experimental results compare favourably with theoretical predictions. However, the experimentally observed permanent magnet flux leakage in the double sided machine is larger than predicted theoretically, which can be justified by the limitations in the prototype fabrication and resulting deviations from the theoretical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Paper no. DS 1 - 58 The free-piston {{generators}} {{have the}} advantages of simple structure, high power density and high efficiency, so they are proposed for applying in the series hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). In this paper, a novel PM linear magnetic-geared machine serving as the free-piston generator is proposed. The machine consists of a linear permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) and a linear magnetic gear (LMG), which are integrated together. The proposed machine adopts a structure that the high-speed mover of the LMG and the translator of the linear PMSM share the same moving part. There are four main parts in the machine topology, including the low-speed mover with PMs, the ferromagnetic pole pieces, the high-speed mover with PMs and the stator with three-phase windings. In order to improve {{the speed of the}} PMSM translator, the magnetic-geared topology is adopted, such that the designed machine can generate the high-voltage electricity and have the high power density. In the magnetic-geared machine, the tubular stator is designed as a 12 -slot structure with concentrated windings. In order to integrate the machine and the magnetic gear magnetically and mechanically together, the high-speed mover of the magnetic gear is designed as the translator of the machine. The <b>tubular</b> <b>machine</b> translator consists of one row of PMs. And the low-speed mover of the magnetic gear consists of a tubular iron core and PMs mounted on the inner face of the core. The PMs of both low-speed mover and machine translator are radial magnetized. Between the low-speed mover and the high-speed mover of the magnetic gear, the ferromagnetic pole pieces are fixed there to modulate the magnetic fields. Since the LMG has the advantage of high force density inherently, the proposed novel PM linear magnetic-geared machine can obtain the high power density, high efficiency and weight reduction by comparing with the conventional linear machines.
