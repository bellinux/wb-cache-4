5000|$|The Legendary Feared Bakuryū CarnoRyutus & ChasmoShieldon were evil Bakuryū that {{intended}} to turn Dino Earth into an icy wasteland. However, Freezia's sacrifice sealed them into icy prison. But the Evoliens originally {{intended to}} control them, sending them to Another Earth, but Galvidi stole part of the BakuLaser from them. Once he obtained the other half, the Feared Bakuryū arrived to Tokyo in the movie. The other Bakuryū fought off the two in vain as Galvidi had them combine to form BakurenOh (Movie, 48) by the command [...] "Combine! CarnoRyutus! ChasmoShieldon!" [...] (Gattai! Karnoryūtusu! Kasmosearudon!) BakurenOh could use its sword to slice off AbarenOh's drill-arm {{and use it as}} its own to form BakurenOh <b>Twin</b> <b>Drill</b> before the other Bakuryū forced it to give it back. BakurenOh was soon defeated by Killer AbarenOh, sinking into the bottom of Tokyo Bay until it was reawakened by DezumoVoorla, using the evil of humanity, to make it an ideal body for Dezumorlya. Soon it was defeated once again by AbarenOh and MaxOhja and sinks the bottom of Tokyo Bay then sealed.|$|E

50|$|Munsoruto This robotic monster {{appeared}} in episode 4. Its powers include flight, a 3-tube missile launcher in each arm, mouth flames, <b>twin</b> <b>drills</b> in each foot, crescent blasts from the head, and a sword in each shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|She has pink hair styled in <b>twin</b> <b>drills.</b> She {{appears in}} Aika Zero {{as a student}} at St. Aero where she notices some of Aika and the student council actions. At the end of Aika Zero she and Rudolf take in E.T.A.I. and Miyu for further research.|$|R
5000|$|Borr: An {{orange and}} black tank with <b>twin</b> <b>drills</b> that can fly or burrow underground. Its driver is Sydney. Also, a famous {{basketball}} player—Charles [...] "High Jump" [...] Johnson—was dragged along {{to fight a}} Mega-Virus monster as a temporary driver for Borr when the band used the vehicles to escape the locked high school (in the episode [...] "Syber-Dunk"). Borr forms Synchro's gauntlets and shoulder armor; and Xenon's torso and upper legs.|$|R
5000|$|Axl (voiced by Brian Drummond) - Axl is the Knight of Truth. He is a {{large man}} {{who is one of}} the Knights of Knighton, loves food, and is the strongman of the team. His armor is yellow and his crest is a bull, and he wields a massive battleaxe. When in need of a vehicle he boards the Tower Carrier, a truck pulling a {{detachable}} small tower. Later on, Axl drives a new vehicle called the Rumble Maker, which has large <b>twin</b> <b>drills</b> up front.|$|R
40|$|Following on {{from the}} {{successful}} project to recover an ice core to bedrock on Berkner Island, similar drilling equipment and logistics were used on two further projects to recover ice cores to bedrock in the Antarctic Peninsula. At James Ross Island, a ship- and helicopter-supported project drilled to bedrock at 363 m depth in a single season, while a <b>Twin</b> Otter-supported project <b>drilled</b> to bedrock at 654 m depth, again in a single season, from Fletcher Promontory. In both new projects, drilling was from the surface, with the infrastructure enclosed in a tent, using an uncased, partially fluid-filled, borehole...|$|R
40|$|Atomic {{arrangements}} on {{the twin}} boundaries of orthoclase twins IN the extensive literature {{dealing with the}} growth twinning in crystals, two approaches have been followed. Friedel (1926) related twinning to a lattice common to both parts of the twin, while others have considered how the atoms at the junction must be packed to give substantially the same interatomic distance and bond angles as in the Z single crystal. The second approach has been 9 adopted in this paper. T This investigation {{has been carried out}} by con-) r structing ball-and-spoke models of the various twins. The balls constituting the boundary between the two parts of the <b>twin</b> have been <b>drilled</b> to accord with the full symmetry of the twinned crystal, whil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{traditional}} measurement while drilling (MWD) method cannot {{meet the}} high reliability, high precision requirements for drilling complex structure wells. A guided-orientation method based on {{rotating magnetic field}} has prominent advantages on the twin parallel horizontal wells and can apply in twin parallel horizontal wells. In this paper, RMRS, namely Rotating Magnet Ranging system, its operating principle was gave firstly while applied for <b>drilling</b> <b>twin</b> parallel horizontal wells. The rotating magnetic sub was characterized {{by a pair of}} orthogonal magnetic dipoles, and then build the model for positioning the twin parallel horizontal wells Finally, the authors used the Maxwell software to simulate the algorithm based on the scene environment, and then proves that algorithm is correct and useful for guiding the well to drill and keeping the twin wells parallel...|$|R
40|$|As {{the birthplace}} of the oil and gas industry, Azerbaijanâs long and rich history is {{intertwined}} with hydrocarbon production, with oil drilling pre-dating activity in Pennsylvania by 13 years. The involvement of foreign oil companies in the late 1800 s, including the Nobel Brothers, resulted in the country becoming the worldâs foremost oil producer at the turn of that century. The Soviet era precluded further international investment, but saw a dramatic growth in gas production commencing in the 1920 s. The 1990 s witnessed the return of the IOCs with the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field (oil and associated gas) and the Shah Deniz (gas and condensate) field developments reversing the trend of production decline and creating an export surplus in both oil and gas. In this paper, Gulmira Rzayeva provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges which were surmounted {{in the development of the}} Shah Deniz field, not least of which related to establishing export pipelines and marketing arrangements in Turkey, and (for Phase 2) Europe. Turning to the future, the paper details the nature and estimated potential of partially developed fields, discoveries at varying stages of appraisal and prospective structures in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. Apart from the inevitable range of uncertainty over future production levels and timing, what emerges are the <b>twin</b> challenges of <b>drilling</b> rig availability (it being impossible to bring an assembled rig into the Caspian due to width restrictions on the Volga-Don canal) and the highly challenging sub-surface drilling conditions. The modest prospects for domestic gas demand growth and Azerbaijanâs geographic location require that any future gas field development decision will also require a degree of certainty on export infrastructure capacity to the primary target markets of Turkey and South and South East Europe. These issues are covered in detail. </p...|$|R
