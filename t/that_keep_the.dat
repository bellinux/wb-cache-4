5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type {{304 stainless steel}} rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E

25|$|Another major {{contributor}} to angiogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> vessel walls solid. This proteolysis allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting angiogenesis. Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease {{the integrity of the}} microvasculature.|$|E

The 199th BSB provides supply and transportation (Company A), medical (Company C) and maintenance (Company B) support and services <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> 256th Brigade operational.

25|$|Once in the tank, {{the wider}} cross {{sectional}} area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture, allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth.

25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running {{down the center of}} the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{theory is}} that the neural {{functions}} that regulate sleep are out of balance {{in such a way that}} causes different sleep states to overlap. In this case, cholinergic sleep on neural populations are hyper activated and the serotonergic sleep off neural populations are under-activated. As a result, the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the sleep state, the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> brain in the sleep state. During normal REM sleep, the threshold for a stimulus to cause arousal is greatly elevated. Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used to}} digest tissues, as {{in a process that}} was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with coffee-like appearance, and the only solid that remains are bone hulls, which could be crushed between one's fingertips. Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing roadkill dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors. Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian serial killer Leonarda Cianciulli used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap. In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it. Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability to hydrolyze protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in the eye can be more serious and can lead to blindness. This danger is often overlooked.|$|E

500|$|In September 2007, it was {{announced}} that the new station would feature platform screen doors. However, plans for screen doors in New York City Subway stations were dropped in 2012, because of their high cost of $1 million per platform edge. Even without the inclusion of platform screen doors for ventilation and safety purposes, the stationâ€”along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadwayâ€“Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations on the Upper East Sideâ€”includes special air-cooling systems <b>that</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> temperature at [...] year-round. These systems, which already existed at Grand Centralâ€“42nd Street station, help reduce the temperature along platforms.
