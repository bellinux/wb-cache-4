5|$|Disposal of damaged flags is also {{covered by}} the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully {{destroyed}}; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with {{the dignity of the}} flag.|$|E
5|$|Wheat beer is brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> by law). The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.|$|E

50|$|After his Solartaxi tour, Palmer {{drew from}} his {{previous}} experience {{when he became}} the initiator and tour director of an organized race. The Zero Emissions Race took place between August 2010 and February 2011. The aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make it {{around the world in}} 80 days and to show what emission-free vehicles can accomplish. Palmer invited four teams to enter the competition, setting vehicle criteria that <b>were</b> quite concrete: <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> propelled by an electric motor, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> drive a certain distance in a certain time, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> carry at least two passengers. Through Zero Emissions Race, Palmer was once again able to draw attention to his vision of sustainable living.|$|R

5|$|Later that night, Jerry {{finds out}} from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to talk more about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E
5|$|The Air Gates play a {{vital role}} in the Red Bull Air Race, but must also fulfill complex and {{contradictory}} demands. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delicate enough to burst apart the instant they are touched by an aircraft and sturdy enough to remain stationary in all weather conditions, including stormy weather and strong winds. The early cylindrical pylons fulfilled the first criterion but proved to be too unstable in the wind.|$|E
5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
3000|$|This part of {{the coding}} process also {{included}} finding, defining and redefining the attributes and more than 20, 000 instances of decision-making and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done more than once. 1 [...]...|$|R
50|$|During {{the severe}} 1994 Los Angeles {{earthquake}} the LRB-protected University of Southern California Teaching Hospital remained operational while the ten other {{hospitals in the}} area were so badly damaged that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated.|$|R
50|$|Due to James Kelly and Matt Dea being {{signed as}} top up players {{because of the}} 2012 Essendon {{supplements}} saga, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delisted and then re-signed {{in order to stay}} on Essendon's list.|$|R
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E
5|$|To produce horses {{with some}} Arabian {{characteristics}} but coat colors {{not found in}} purebreds, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crossbred with other breeds. Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors, they {{do not appear to}} carry any color-based lethal disorders such as the frame overo gene ("O") that can produce lethal white syndrome (LWS). Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS foals, Arabian mares were used as a non-affected population in some of the studies seeking the gene that caused the condition in other breeds. Nonetheless, partbred Arabian offspring can, in some cases, carry these genes if the non-Arabian parent was a carrier.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and {{approved}} of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon’s conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: “Well... <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid. That’s all there is to that. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid.” During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.|$|E
50|$|According <b>to</b> Juslenius, words <b>are</b> {{not born}} in vain, in other words, without the {{presence}} of meaningful facts. If the Finns cried that they will strike their enemies once, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one up in battle.|$|R
25|$|Mules were shod {{every other}} trip in Cumberland, {{although}} sometimes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shod every trip. Mules were harnessed, one behind the other, slantwise, which (for some reason) pulled the boat straighter, {{than if they}} were abreast.|$|R
25|$|Another {{period of}} decay followed, and by 1960 the centre and its {{equipment}} were again so dilapidated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closed. The idea of balneology had also completely changed. The Municipality repurchased the spa, including the neighbouring Château d'Entremonts.|$|R
25|$|What most touch pieces have {{in common}} is that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> touched or in close {{physical}} contact for the power concerned to be obtained and/or transferred. Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an amulet.|$|E
25|$|Crumbing forward pockets do not {{exclusively}} crumb the ball. Sometimes, they lead {{for the ball}} like full forwards, so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> competent at marking the ball. Some forward pockets can even jump so high that they can contest marks, despite their lack of height.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{brake blocks}} between the wheels that are {{pressed against the}} track when the gripman pulls a lever, {{bringing}} the car to a halt. The four blocks are made of Douglas fir (pine) and can produce a smell of burning wood when in operation. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced {{after just a few}} days.|$|E
25|$|Task Force Bravo's three regiments were {{defeated}} and in retrograde mode by 26 September. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stabilized by hasty commitment of a regrouped and previously defeated regiment. Task force regiments later were thwarted in capturing two objectives from the PAVN.|$|R
2500|$|The {{experiment}} {{failed and}} the racing stopped because although the cheetahs <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> better the greyhound times <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> let off first when racing greyhounds {{and when they}} raced against each other they became disinterested and stopped chasing the lure.|$|R
30|$|In its new {{deployment}} model, Microsoft Azure, provides {{network security}} groups {{in addition to}} endpoints. They allow separate inbound/outbound configuration. While <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> configured {{by means of the}} Azure command line in the past, they are now accessible via the web interface.|$|R
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} polymerized by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to go into the plasma state. Though monomers with multiple bonds polymerize readily, it is not a necessary requirement, as ethane, silicones and many others polymerize also.|$|E
25|$|Private {{generation}} decentralizes {{the generation}} of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy. While <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> purchased, solar shingles and panels are both available. Capital cost is high, but saves in the long run. With appropriate power conversion, solar PV panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources.|$|E
25|$|With {{a bit of}} {{set-theoretic}} care 𝐍𝐨 can {{be equipped}} with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences {{can be defined as}} well although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his loss}} to Hughes, Riggs rebounded to win against future {{longtime}} Strikeforce Welterweight Champion, Nick Diaz via decision at UFC 57. In {{the hospital room}} after the fight, Diaz and Riggs got into a physical altercation where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated by police.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there have}} been far more prestigious Loony results before and after (particularly Monmouth), Bootle is still {{regarded}} by Raving Loonies as their finest hour, the watershed moment when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated as a serious political party, albeit one largely lampooning the political world.|$|R
25|$|S-trains run on standard-gauge {{tracks and}} are powered via {{overhead}} wires. The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 volts DC (negative overhead wire), indicating that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a feeder station. Power {{is drawn from}} the national grid through 38 feeder stations. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively {{close to each other}} because the large currents in the overhead wires (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Inner {{photoelectric}} effect (see photodiode below). The hole left behind can {{give rise to}} Auger effect, which is visible even when the electron does not leave the material. In molecular solids phonons are excited in this step and may be visible as lines in the final electron energy. The inner photoeffect has to be dipole allowed. The transition rules for atoms translate via the tight-binding model onto the crystal. They are similar in geometry to plasma oscillations in that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transversal.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} the {{practice}} of culling healthy puppies (with the implication that killing them was what was meant), Kennel Club chairman Ronnie Irving denied knowledge of such practices {{and said that they}} were not acceptable. It was shown that after the interview, the Kennel Club wrote to the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club condemning the practice and requested that the club review their code of ethics. The breed club said that the Kennel Club knew about the code of ethics, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ratified by the Kennel Club every year.|$|E
25|$|As sizable {{numbers of}} civilians {{who had been}} {{relocated}} into Finland from Karelia in 1939–40 had moved back into Karelia during the war, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated again; of the 260,000 civilians who had moved back into the Karelia, only 19 chose to remain and become Soviet citizens.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 29 F1 cars were entered for this event, however only 22 arrived for the race. The field {{was smaller than}} usual as {{there was no time}} for teams to repair damaged cars after the Monaco, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported 1,200 miles from Monaco to Anderstorp.|$|R
