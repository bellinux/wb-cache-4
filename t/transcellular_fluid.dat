5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> that circulates {{around the}} brain in the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord.

A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E

40|$|Ion {{transport}} {{is essential}} for maintenance of transmembranous and <b>transcellular</b> electric potential, <b>fluid</b> transport and cellular volume. Disturbance of ion transport {{has been associated with}} cellular dysfunction, intra and extracellular edema and abnormalities of epithelial surface liquid volume. There is increasing evidence that conditions characterized by an intense local or systemic inflammatory response are associated with abnormal ion transport. This abnormal ion transport has been involved in the pathogenesis of conditions like hypovolemia due to fluid losses, hyponatremia and hypokalemia in diarrhoeal diseases, electrolyte abnormalites in pyelonephritis of early infancy, septicemia induced pulmonary edema, and in hypersecretion and edema induced by inflammatory reactions of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Components of membranous ion transport systems, which have been shown to undergo a change in function during an inflammatory response include the sodium potassium ATPase, the epithelial sodium channel, the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator and calcium activated chloride channels and the sodium potassium chloride co-transporter. Inflammatory mediators, which influence ion transport are tumor necrosis factor, gamma interferon, interleukins, transforming growth factor, leukotrienes and bradykinin. They trigger the release of specific messengers like prostaglandins, nitric oxide and histamine which alter ion transport system function through specific receptors, intracellular second messengers and protein kinases. This review summarizes data on in vivo measurements of changes in ion transport in acute inflammatory conditions and in vitro studies, which have explored the underlying mechanisms. Potential interventions directed at a correction of the observed abnormalities are discussed...|$|R

Examples of this fluid are cerebrospinal fluid, ocular fluid and joint fluid.|$|E
50|$|Interstitial fluid (ISF) or {{tissue fluid}} is a {{solution}} that bathes and surrounds the tissue cells of multicellular animals.

50|$|The third {{extracellular}} compartment, the transcellular, {{consists of}} those {{spaces in the}} body where fluid does not normally collect in larger amounts, or where any significant fluid collection is physiologically nonfunctional. Examples of transcellular spaces include the eye, the central nervous system, the peritoneal and pleural cavities, and the joint capsules. A small amount of fluid, called <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid,</b> does exist normally in such spaces. For example, the aqueous humor, the vitreous humor, the cerebrospinal fluid, the serous fluid produced by the serous membranes, and the synovial fluid produced by the synovial membranes are all transcellular fluids. They are all very important, yet {{there is not much}} of each. For example, there is only about 150 mL of cerebrospinal fluid in the entire central nervous system at any moment. All of the aforementioned fluids are produced by active cellular processes working with blood plasma as the raw material, and they are all more or less similar to blood plasma except for certain modifications tailored to their function. For example, the cerebrospinal fluid is made by various cells of the CNS, mostly the ependymal cells, from blood plasma.|$|E

40|$|The {{signalling}} peptide bradykinin (BK) is {{implicated in}} inflammation and angiogenesis. It promotes fluid transport from blood vessels to interstitial space, and thus facilitates oedema formation. To clarify whether paracellular or transcellular pathways mediate this effect, we investigated the BK-stimulated fluid transport across endothelial monolayers in vitro by comparison of electrical and fluorescence methods. Electrical cell impedance sensing monitored a biphasic response of cell layers to BK with high time resolution: a short decrease (18 %, 1 min) {{was followed by}} a more sustained increase in paracellular resistance (30 %, 10 min). The two phases can be assigned to second messengers of the BK-signalling pathway: Ca 2 + for the decrease and cyclic adenosine monophosphate for the rise of resistance, respectively. Despite tightening of the intercellular clefts, BK increased the fluid permeability by 39 %, indicating <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> transport. Additionally, BK stimulated both in- and outwardly directed membrane trafficking as assessed by vesicular fluid uptake (by 49 %) and secretion of von Willebrandt factor (by 85 %). In conclusion, the combination of electrical and fluorescence data suggests that BK induces a shift from para- to <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> transport across endothelium...|$|E
40|$|The three-pore {{model of}} peritoneal fluid {{transport}} predicts {{that once the}} osmotic gradient has dissipated, fluid reabsorption will {{be due to a}} combination of small-pore reabsorption driven by the intravascular oncotic pressure, and an underlying disappearance of fluid from the cavity by lymphatic drainage. Our study measured fluid transport by these pathways in the presence and absence of an osmotic gradient. Paired hypertonic and standard glucose-dwell studies were performed using radio-iodinated serum albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker and changes in intraperitoneal sodium mass to determine small-pore versus <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> transport. Disappearance of iodinated albumin was considered to indicate lymphatic drainage. Variability in transcellular ultrafiltration was largely explained by the rate of small-solute transport across the membrane. In the absence of an osmotic gradient, fluid reabsorption occurred via the small-pore pathway, the rate being proportional to the small-solute transport characteristics of the membrane. In most cases, fluid removal from the peritoneal cavity by this pathway was faster than by lymphatic drainage. Our study shows that the three-pore model describes the pathways of peritoneal fluid transport well. In the presence of high solute transport, poor transcellular ultrafiltration was due to loss of the osmotic gradient and an enhanced small-pore reabsorption rate after this gradient dissipated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} causes of {{hypotension}} during extracorporeal renal replacement therapy is an insuf-ficient substitution of the ultrafiltrated plasma water by tissue water. To investigate the fluid balance {{and its effects on}} hypotension in dialysed patients, the follow-ing variables were studied: intracellular fluid volume (IFV) and extracellular fluid volume (EFV), blood volume (BV) and blood pressure. IFV and EFV were measured by means of non-invasive electrical conducti-vity measurements using four electrodes round the leg. Fifteen haemofiltration (HF) and 15 haemodialysis (HD) patients were studied. The latter group was dialysed in three ways: (1) conventionally, i. e. with dialysate sodium of 138 mmol/ 1 (HD) (2) with a variable dialysate sodium (first half: 138 mmol/ 1; second half: 146 mmol/ 1) (HDS), and (3) with the same variable dialysate sodium and an ultrafiltration profile (two-thirds was withdrawn {{during the first half of}} treatment, the remain-der during the second half) (HDSU). Hypotension frequency was less during HDS, HDSU, and HF compared to HD. This was caused by a more stable blood volume due to a better refill. During HD a fluid shift occurred from the EC to the IC compartment. The use of a high sodium dialysate concentration led to a <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> shift in the opposite direction. This fluid shift increased the refill, thereby stabilising blood volume. HF gave a better refill than HDS and HDSU, probably due to a reduced urea clearance...|$|E
40|$|All {{characterized}} mammalian aquaporins (AQPs) are localized to plasma membranes {{where they}} function chiefly to mediate water transport across cells. Here {{we show that}} AQP 6 is localized exclusively in intracellular membranes in renal epithelia. By using a polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of AQP 6, immunoblots revealed a major 30 -kDa band in membranes from rat renal cortex and medulla. Endoglycosidase treatment demonstrated presence of an intracellular high mannose glycan on each subunit. Sequential ultracentrifugation of rat kidney homogenates confirmed that AQP 6 resides predominantly in vesicular fractions, and immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed that > 98 % of AQP 6 is located in intracellular membrane vesicles. In glomeruli, AQP 6 is present in membrane vesicles within podocyte cell bodies and foot processes. In proximal tubules, AQP 6 is also abundant in membrane vesicles within the subapical compartment of segment 2 and segment 3 cells, but was not detected in the brush border or basolateral membranes. In collecting duct, AQP 6 resides in intracellular membrane vesicles in apical, mid, and basolateral cytoplasm of type A intercalated cells, but was not observed in the plasma membrane. Unlike {{other members of the}} AQP family, the unique distribution in intracellular membrane vesicles in multiple types of renal epithelia indicates that AQP 6 is not simply involved in <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> absorption. Moreover, our studies predict that AQP 6 participates in distinct physiological functions such as glomerular filtration, tubular endocytosis, and acid-base metabolism. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{anadromous}} salmonid {{life cycle}} includes both fresh water (FW) and seawater (SW) stages. The parr-smolt transformation (smoltification) pre–adapt {{the fish to}} SW while still in FW. The osmoregulatory organs change their mode of action from a role of preventing water inflow in FW, to absorb ions to replace water lost by osmosis in SW. During smoltification, the drinking rate increases, in the intestine the ion and fluid transport increases and is further elevated after SW entry. In SW, the intestine absorbs ions to create an inwardly directed water flow which is accomplished by increased Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) activity in the basolateral membrane, driving ion absorption via ion channels and/or co-transporters. This review will aim at discussing the expression patterns of the ion transporting proteins involved in intestinal fluid absorption in the FW stage, during smoltification and after SW entry. Of equal importance for intestinal fluid absorption as the active absorption of ions, is the permeability of the epithelium to ions and water. During the smoltification the increase in NKA activity and water uptake in SW is accompanied by decreased paracellular permeability suggesting a redirection of the fluid movement from a paracellular route in FW, to a transcellular route in SW. Increased <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> absorption could be achieved by incorporation of aquaporins (AQPs) into the enterocyte membranes and/or by a change in fatty acid profile of the enterocyte lipid bilayer. An increased incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into the membrane phospholipids will increase water permeability by enhancing the fluidity of the membrane. A second aim of the present review is therefore to discuss the presence and regulation of expression of AQPs in the enterocyte membrane {{as well as to}} discuss the profile of fatty acids present in the membrane phospholipids during different stages of the salmonid lifecycle...|$|E
40|$|The water channels, aquaporins (AQPs) are key {{mediators}} of <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> transport. However, their {{expression and}} role in cardiac tissue is poorly characterized. Particularly, AQP 1 was suggested to transport other molecules (nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)) with potential major bearing on cardiovascular physiology. We therefore examined {{the expression of}} all AQPs and the phenotype of AQP 1 knockout mice (vs. wild-type littermates) under implanted telemetry in vivo, as well as endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated aortas and resistance vessels ex vivo. Four aquaporins were expressed in wild-type heart tissue (AQP 1, AQP 7, AQP 4, AQP 8) and two aquaporins in aortic and mesenteric vessels (AQP 1 -AQP 7). AQP 1 was expressed in endothelial as well as cardiac and vascular muscle cells and co-segregated with caveolin- 1. AQP 1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a prominent microcardia and decreased myocyte transverse dimensions despite no change in capillary density. Both male and female AQP 1 KO mice had lower mean BP, which was not attributable to altered water balance or autonomic dysfunction (from baroreflex and frequency analysis of BP and HR variability). NO-dependent BP variability was unperturbed. Accordingly, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDH(F)) or NO-dependent relaxation were unchanged in aorta or resistance vessels ex vivo. However, AQP 1 KO mesenteric vessels exhibited an increase in endothelial prostanoids-dependent relaxation, together with increased expression of COX- 2. This enhanced relaxation was abrogated by COX inhibition. We conclude that AQP 1 does not regulate the endothelial EDH or NO-dependent relaxation ex vivo or in vivo, but its deletion decreases baseline BP together with increased prostanoids-dependent relaxation in resistance vessels. Strikingly, this was associated with microcardia, unrelated to perturbed angiogenesis. This may raise interest for new inhibitors of AQP 1 and their use to treat hypertrophic cardiac remodeling...|$|E
40|$|Radiosulfate, 35 SO 4, and radiobromide, 82 Br, were {{administered}} simultaneously to rats and dogs. In rats, the apparent volume of distribution of 82 Br averaged 30 % {{of body weight}} and was constant between 0. 5 and 35 hr after injection. The apparent volume of distribution of 35 SO 4, corrected for urinary loss, increased by 6 % body weight/hr: the extrapolated volume at zero time was 88 % of bromide space. Analysis of individual tissues and carcasses for 82 Br and inorganic 35 SO 4 showed that equilibration of both isotopes in several organs and in the whole carcass was rapidly achieved within 1 to 2 hr: no further increase in measured spaces occurred in 24 hr. The carcass inorganic sulfate space was 92 %± 2 % of the bromide space in intact rats, and showed no increase with time. However, a progressively greater fraction of the injected 35 SO 4 was not recovered, owing to metabolic alteration. In eviscerated rats, the inorganic sulfate space was a smaller and much more constant fraction (79. 8 % ± 0. 4 %) of the bromide space, showing that at least 20 % of body bromide (and hence chloride) is nonextracellular. The viscera chiefly responsible for the higher ratio of spaces in the intact animal were the liver, small bowel, and kidney. In the last two organs, excess inorganic 35 SO 4 (beyond the bromide space) was attributable to trapped <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> in which sulfate had been concentrated more than chloride (or bromide). Excess sulfate in liver and cartilage could not be explained in this manner: the results suggest passive binding of sulfate, but could reflect active cell uptake in these tissues. No excess sulfate was found in skin or tail. The implications of these observations {{with respect to the}} distribution of body chloride and the measurement of extracellular space are discussed. The extracellular volume of the rat is estimated to be 24 % of body weight...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{quantify}} spontaneous fluid transport {{across the}} isolated porcine ciliary epithelium and determine its {{sensitivity to the}} electrolyte transport inhibitors ouabain and bumetanide, as well as bath Cl- and HCO 3 - levels. METHODS. A complete annulus of ciliary body was mounted in a custom-designed chamber appropriate for quantifying net fluid movement, {{as well as the}} transepithelial potential difference (PD) across the in vitro ciliary epithelium. RESULTS. A spontaneous and stable fluid flow (FF) in the blood-to-aqueous direction was measured over a 4 -hour period. This flux solely reflected the secretory activity of the isolated ciliary epithelium (CE), given the absence of externally applied osmotic or pressure gradients. In contrast to FF, the PD declined during the 4 hours in vitro, suggesting that the integrity of the tight junctions may have been compromised during this time so that an increased movement of counter ions via the paracellular pathway could have shunted the PD, {{while at the same time}} <b>transcellular</b> <b>fluid</b> transport remained unaffected. The FF in the blood-to-aqueous direction (2. 3 ± 0. 2 μL/hr; n = 7) was eliminated by a unilateral reduction in the bath CP levels on the blood side of the preparation and restored on reintroducing the anion to the bathing medium. This linkage between FF and blood side [Cl-] is consistent with the existence of a net Cl- flux across the porcine CE in the same direction as the fluid transport. Addition of bumetanide to the blood-side bath inhibited FF by ≈ 40 %, whereas the removal of CO 2 /HCO 3 - from the blood-side bathing solution elicited a ≈ 50 % reduction in FF. Ouabain inhibited the FF from either side of the preparation, although the effects were more rapid when the glycoside was applied to the blood side of the tissue. Overall, these findings indicate the dependence of FF on active ionic transport by the isolated CE. CONCLUSIONS. Isolated porcine ciliary epithelial preparations transport fluid in the blood-to-aqueous direction, indicating that measurements of volumetric fluid flow across this preparation may serve as a suitable model for future studies directed toward the pharmacological control of secretion.
