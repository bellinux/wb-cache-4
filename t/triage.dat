5|$|The EMS {{command post}} {{was set up}} almost {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw <b>triage,</b> treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle {{a large number of}} patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The <b>triage</b> center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary <b>triage</b> center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.|$|E

40|$|Empirical studies {{indicate}} that automating the bug assignment process (also known as bug <b>triaging)</b> {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce software evo-lution effort and costs. Prior work has used machine learning techniques to automate bug <b>triaging</b> but has employed a narrow band of tools which can be ineffective in large, long-lived software projects. To redress this situation, in this paper we employ a comprehensive set of machine learning tools and analyzes that lead to very accurate predictions, and lay the foundation for the next gen-eration of machine learning-based bug <b>triaging.</b> Our work is the first to exam-ine the impact of multiple machine learning dimensions (classifiers, attributes, and training history) on prediction accuracy in bug <b>triaging.</b> We employ four classifiers and perform an ablative analysis to show the relative importance of classifiers and various software process attributes on bug <b>triaging</b> accuracy. We propose optimization techniques that achieve high prediction accuracy while reducing training and prediction time. We validate our approach on Mozilla and Eclipse, covering 856, 259 bug reports and 21 cumulative years of develop-ment. We demonstrate that our techniques can achieve up to 86. 09 % prediction accuracy in bug <b>triaging</b> and significantly reduce tossing path lengths...|$|R

Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the <b>triage.</b> The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by <b>triage)</b> require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

40|$|Software bugs are {{inevitable}} and bug fixing {{is an essential}} and costly phase during software development. Such defects are often reported in bug reports which are stored in an issue tracking system, or bug repository. Such reports need to be assigned to the most appropriate developers who will eventually fix the issue/bug reported. This process is often called Bug <b>Triaging.</b> Manual bug <b>triaging</b> is a difficult, expensive, and lengthy process, since it needs the bug triager to manually read, analyze, and assign bug fixers for each newly reported bug. Triagers can become overwhelmed {{by the number of}} reports added to the repository. Time and efforts spent into <b>triaging</b> typically diverts valuable resources away from the improvement of the product to the managing of the development process. To assist triagers and improve the bug <b>triaging</b> efficiency and reduce its cost, this thesis proposes Bugzie, a novel approach for automatic bug <b>triaging</b> based on fuzzy set and cachebased modeling of the bug-fixing capability of developers. Our evaluation results on seven large-scale subject systems show that Bugzie achieves significantly higher levels of efficiency and correctness than existing state-of-the-art approaches.

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The <b>triage</b> system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E

Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Bug <b>Triaging</b> is a {{vital part}} of issue {{management}} systems. Bug <b>triaging</b> deals with assigning a developer the task of an incoming bug. This activity is error prone and time consuming if done manually. There is a need for automated support to accelerate this process. The current automated bug <b>triaging</b> systems exploits the text contents of the bug and the tossing relations among the developers. The automated bug <b>triaging</b> systems estimate the optimal bath between the first assignee of the bug and the bug resolver using the tossing relations. The metrics used for assessing the efficiency of bug <b>triaging</b> systems that are based on tossing relations is Mean number of Steps To Resolve (MSTR). This metric quantifies the number of steps reduced by the predicted path compared to the original path. It does not capture how far the retrieved path is in alignment with the actual path. MSTR does reveal the information regarding {{the extent to which the}} order of the developers in the retrieved path is in line with that of the original path. In addition, there are no indicators for measuring the strength of the retrieved path. In this paper, we propose two metrics (i) Path Similarity Metric which quantifies path alignment based on pair wise path alignment and (ii) Path Alignment Indicator that measures the effectiveness of the retrieved path based on degree centrality. The effectiveness of the two proposed metrics is validated using bug reports extracted from the Eclipse project...|$|R
