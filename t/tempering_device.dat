40|$|DE 102007047435 A 1 UPAB: 20090503 NOVELTY - The device has multi-layered storages (1, 2) {{receiving}} fluid. The fluid is transported {{from one}} storage to another storage {{and from the}} latter storage to the former storage such that the fluid flows through a heat adsorber (4) to be tempered so as to exchange heat between the fluid and the adsorber to be tempered. Each storage has an opening for supplying and discharging the fluid in different heights relative to an innermost point of the storages. The fluid in the layered storage is layered corresponding to its temperature. USE - <b>Tempering</b> <b>device</b> for tempering an adsorber of a heat pump or a refrigerator (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The fluid is transported from one storage to another storage and from the latter storage to the former storage such that the fluid flows through the heat adsorber to be tempered so as to exchange heat between the fluid and the adsorber to be tempered, thus increasing specific cooling performance of the fluid...|$|E

30|$|Among the {{relevant}} works with secure billing feature in VANETs, Yeh et al. proposed a local and proxy-based authentication and billing protocol {{in order to}} reduce the communication overhead. Their protocol proposed an incentive-aware multi-hop forwarding technique for vehicles in the VANETs [7]. The protocol did not consider secure access control which is indispensable for CSPs within the VCC architecture. In another work, Yeh et al. proposed a portable authentication/authorization/accounting (AAA) framework for purchasing services from the road entities (RSUs). They used signature-based and key policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) in their billing mechanism to achieve localized fine-grained access control [4]. However, in their protocol, the system master secret key must be distributed to every vehicle <b>temper</b> proof <b>device.</b> Therefore, in case the <b>temper</b> proof <b>device</b> is compromised, the system security features are affected [8]. Moreover, these protocols are built based on expensive pairing operations which will hinder the whole system efficiency since the CSPs would also provide voluminous files such as mp 3 files or movies.|$|R
50|$|The {{campus is}} notable for its {{employment}} of solar photovoltaic panels, {{one on a}} ninety-meter (293') long solar wall, is the longest in the world. Water is heated through the employment of solar heating panels. The campus plan is devised to re-generate the subterranean aquifer system. A water collection pool, near the river, acts as a holding pool, recharging and sustaining the micro-environment and bio-diversity of the campus. A system of canals and water management <b>devices,</b> <b>temper</b> the flow and retention of water in this drought prone area.|$|R
40|$|There are {{the results}} of putting into {{practice}} a comprehensive program for physically handicapped people in the late period of stroke. The study included 39 disabled people with brain attack effects - 10 men (25. 6 %) and 29 women (74. 4 %) aged 24 - 68 years. A program of physical rehabilitation included physical therapy, massage, dosed walking, <b>tempering,</b> biostimulation (Shuboshi <b>device),</b> diet therapy. It was determined that using the mentioned methods for recovering disabled people leads to increasing the circles on limb segments in healthy (up to 14 %) and in the caused (up to 11 %) sides. The putting into practice a comprehensive rehabilitation program also leads to improving of hand dynamometry indices (men 24 % and women - 9 %), to boosting static muscle endurance of shoulder structure in men to 88 %, women to 105 % {{on the side of}} hemiparesis; to forming optimal locomotion, thus maintaining any rate of walking 1 hour- 46. 3 % of patients, 30 - 45 minutes - 38. 4 %; to stable compensation of orthostaticus violations in 31 individuals (79. 6 %) ...|$|R
6000|$|Was the {{cardinal}} {{put out of}} <b>temper</b> by a <b>device</b> which appeared in this book? On the leaf succeeding the title-page was the privilege for its publication, granted by Leo {{in terms of the}} most flattering personal recognition.[16] So far so good; unless the unpoetical Este patron was not pleased to see such interest taken in the book by the tasteful Medici patron. But on the back of this leaf was a device of a hive, with the bees burnt out of it for their honey, and the motto, [...] "Evil for good" [...] (Pro bono malum). Most biographers are of opinion that this device was aimed at {{the cardinal}}'s ill return for all the sweet words lavished on him and his house. If so, and supposing Ariosto to have presented the dedication-copy in person, it would have been curious to see the faces of the two men while his Eminence was looking at it. Some will think that the good-natured poet could hardly have taken such an occasion of displaying his resentment. But the device did not express at whom it was aimed: the cardinal need not have applied it to himself if he did not choose, especially as the book was full of his praises; and good-natured people will not always miss an opportunity of covertly inflicting a sting. The device, at all events, shewed that the honey-maker had got worse than nothing by his honey; and the house of Este could not say they had done any thing to contradict it.|$|R
