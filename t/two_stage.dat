50|$|The {{first stage}} {{of the project was}} {{approved}} in late 1953 and construction began in early 1954. Initially a two-stage construction was conceived. But the total generation capacity of the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> was too large for load forecasts of that time. So a time lag of more than 10 years was proposed between the <b>two</b> <b>stages.</b> Within <b>two</b> years thereafter, it came to be noticed that the 10 years time tag between these <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> will not be affordable and to cope up with the power requirements, the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> should be merged and both the stages should be constructed simultaneously. Hence, it was accepted that the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> have to be executed as one.|$|R

5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe {{turned in a}} similar strong ride at the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, {{in that it was}} a dead flat run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E
5|$|The Aalborg Symphony Orchestra (Aalborg Symfoniorkester) {{founded in}} 1943 {{presents}} about 150 concerts a year, frequently {{playing in the}} Musikkens Hus.

5|$|The last <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> plays Olivier {{directed}} were Jean Giradoux's Amphitryon (1971) and Priestley's Eden End (1974). By {{the time}} of Eden End, {{he was no longer}} director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973. The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and Olivier felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor. The largest of the three theatres within the National's new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the Olivier Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech of welcome, which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.|$|E
