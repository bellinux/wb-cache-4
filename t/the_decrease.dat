Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

Surface electromyographic (EMG) activities from the biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB) were recorded.
