5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Moulting both run jobs on {{the head}} and the back of the spine to the sides, the legs and the underside. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> grow longer in the summer, to about ten millimetres long.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is cut, wet <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{by taking}} a shower. Then take a towel and dry <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by rubbing <b>the</b> towel vigorously until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is mostly dry (it should still be {{somewhat}} wet) and stands up. Put a hat on forwards (backwards does not usually work as well) and blow dry <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is flipped up as desired. To maintain it, hairspray may be used, although if <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is short enough, it {{should be able to}} stay flipped up by itself.|$|R
5000|$|Hair growth begins inside <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. <b>The</b> only [...] "living" [...] {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{is found in}} <b>the</b> follicle. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> that is visible is <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft, which {{exhibits}} no biochemical activity and is considered [...] "dead". The base of a <b>hair's</b> root (<b>the</b> [...] "bulb") contains the cells that produce <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft. Other structures of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle include <b>the</b> oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and <b>the</b> arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> effect results in goose bumps.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{chemicals}} {{are applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> each strand of hair begins to swell. This swelling causes <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> to forget its original form. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> then begins to shrink back to its normal size, permanently taking on <b>the</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is currently in.|$|R
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where the tips of <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).|$|E
5|$|The glands deposit sebum on <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{collections}} {{kept away}} from public view are the numerous blood-soaked garments from Jesuits martyred in Japan, the skull of Cardinal Morton, the ropes used to quarter St Edmund Campion SJ, <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> of St Francis Xavier SJ, an enormous solid silver jewel-encrusted monstrance, the Wintour vestments, a cope made for Henry VII, and a thorn said {{to be from the}} crown of thorns placed upon Jesus' head at the crucifixion.|$|E
40|$|Synopsis-The {{results of}} two model {{experiments}} show that SERUM does not creep along <b>the</b> <b>HAIR.</b> Accordingly, <b>the</b> sebum which coats <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> does not originate from its FOLLICLE. It {{is assumed that}} <b>the</b> terminal <b>hair</b> picks up sebum mechanically from surrounding follicles. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> and <b>the</b> S'EBACEOUS GLAND together form the pilosebaceous apparatus in both man and hairy animals. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> protects <b>the</b> body from loss of warmth, while the sebaceous glands protect <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by covering it with]ipid. Therefore, we can as-sume that the sebum, which is present in <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, is coating <b>the</b> whole <b>hair.</b> Greasing of <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> which takes place during its growth out of the sebum-filled follicle, is of minor importance, since <b>the</b> rate of <b>hair</b> growth is only 0. 35 mm a day. Moreover, recoating of hair by sebum occurs within a few days. Therefore, creeping of the sebum along <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> as has been assumed by some authors (1), (2), seems to provide a natural explanation for <b>the</b> process of <b>hair</b> greasing...|$|R
50|$|Washing <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{cleansed}} it of the styling products {{but also}} exposed {{the damage done}} to <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by <b>the</b> chemical process. As <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> grew out, <b>the</b> wearer would be required to touch up <b>the</b> new <b>hair</b> growth, further adding to the overall expense.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of <b>the</b> hybrids {{exhibits}} {{a pattern of}} hollowness, which blends the traits of both polar bears and grizzlies. In cross section, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of polar bears is hollow, while <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of grizzlies is either solid or has small hollow regions. This varies according to which part of <b>the</b> grizzly <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is located. In the hybrid male, <b>the</b> paw <b>hair</b> was solid, but <b>the</b> dark back <b>hair</b> was somewhat hollow, albeit with [...] "smaller empty regions than found in polar bear hair". <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> of <b>the</b> female hybrid, [...] "contains a range of hollow regions".|$|R
5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Other archeological objects found {{along with}} the mummies included: headdresses with feathers, pottery, statues made out of gold and silver and textiles. A total of 145 objects were found {{together}} with the mummies. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> found with the mummies and as offerings accompanying the mummies have been subject of research to establish {{the background of the}} victims.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away <b>the</b> <b>hairs.</b> The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
50|$|A hair iron or hair tong {{is a tool}} used {{to change}} the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> using heat. There are three general kinds: curling irons, used to make <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> curly, straightening irons, commonly called straighteners or flat irons, used to straighten <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> and crimping irons, used to create crimps of the desired size in <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Endothrix {{refers to}} dermatophyte infections of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> that invade <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft and {{internalize}} into <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cell. This {{is in contrast}} to exothrix (ectothrix), where a dermatophyte infection remains confined to <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> surface. Using an ultraviolet Wood's lamp, endothrix infections will not fluoresce whereas some exothrix infections may fluoresce bright green or yellow-green.|$|R
25|$|On <b>the</b> scalp, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{is usually}} {{known to be}} lost around <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> line, leaving <b>the</b> densest amount of <b>hair</b> at <b>the</b> crown. Small vellus hair will often replace <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> that is lost.|$|R
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling back on <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> {{at the base}} of the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up {{from the back of}} the neck. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hair</b> cuticle is <b>the</b> {{outermost}} part of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft. It {{is formed}} from dead cells, overlapping in layers, which form scales that gives <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft strength and provide protection for it. Although the cuticle is the outermost layer of <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> {{it does not}} give <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> its color because it has no melanin, which is the pigment responsible; {{the color of a}} person's hair depends on what type of melanin they have, which is found in the cortex.|$|R
50|$|The {{catagen phase}} {{is a short}} {{transition}} stage that occurs {{at the end of}} the anagen phase. It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2-3 weeks while <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> converts to a club hair.A club hair is formed during the catagen phase when the part of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle in contact with the lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> becomes attached to <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft. This process cuts <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> off from its blood supply and from the cells that produce new hair. When a club hair is completely formed, about a 2-week process, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle enters <b>the</b> telogen phase.|$|R
50|$|Kinocilia {{are found}} on the apical surface of hair cells and are {{involved}} in both the morphogenesis of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> bundle and mechanotransduction. Vibrations (either by movement or sound waves) cause displacement of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> bundle, resulting in depolarization or hyperpolarization of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cell. <b>The</b> depolarization of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cells in both instances causes signal transduction via neurotransmitter release.|$|R
5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on <b>the</b> <b>hairs.</b> The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other insects, fleas do {{not possess}} {{compound}} eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> or feathers on the host's body (or {{in the case of}} humans, under clothing). The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.|$|E
40|$|Light {{microscopy}} of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{forms an}} important bedside clinical {{tool for the}} diagnosis of various disorders affecting <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> Hair abnormalities {{can be seen in}} the primary diseases affecting <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> or as a secondary involvement of hair in diseases affecting <b>the</b> scalp. <b>Hair</b> abnormalities also form a part of various genodermatoses and syndromes. In this review, we have briefly highlighted the light microscopic appearance of various infectious and non-infectious conditions affecting <b>the</b> <b>hair...</b>|$|R
50|$|Shampoo and {{conditioner}} {{forms of}} the volumizers are used just like ordinary shampoo or conditioners. The spray and lotion form of volumizers are used on damp <b>hair</b> near <b>the</b> roots of <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> In order to use a <b>hair</b> volumizer, <b>the</b> person using the product must flip their head downward and gradually blow dry <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> with <b>the</b> air being blown along the shaft of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is dry. Drying <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> in this position will increase volume and achieve the desired effect.|$|R
5000|$|A {{permanent}} wave, {{commonly called}} a perm or [...] "permanent", {{involves the use}} of heat and/or chemicals to break and reform the cross-linking bonds of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> structure. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> is washed and wrapped on a form and waving lotion or 'reagent' is applied. This solution reacts chemically softening the inner structure of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by breaking some of the cross links within and between the protein chains of <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> swells, stretches and softens, then molds around the shape of the form.|$|R
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. <b>The</b> <b>hairs</b> come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E
