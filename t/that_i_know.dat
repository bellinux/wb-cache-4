I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
25|$|And if my sensations {{could add}} {{anything}} to the general suffrage, I might relate that I was many years ago so shocked by Cordelia's death <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not whether I ever endured to read again the last scenes of the play till I undertook to revise them as an editor.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
5000|$|After Sandra leaves, General Walters {{offers some}} small {{consolation}} to the aged astronaut: [...] "Stansfield, you're really quite an incredible man.

60|$|Of {{the manner}} and {{extent to which}} he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards {{at the ends of}} hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had, {{respecting}} his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to speak to him about her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.|$|R
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E
25|$|I suspect <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{more of the}} English class {{than any}} man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> are completely untrue.|$|E

[...] However, the money was not a strong enough motivator and in 1758, partly as a way to avoid having to finish his Shakespeare, Johnson began to write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760.|$|E

500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way I {{felt at the}} Grand Prix was down to the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form}} of his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would not be surprised if they performed well in this tournament.|$|E
