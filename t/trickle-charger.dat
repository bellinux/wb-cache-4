50|$|The {{name was}} revived in 1946 by an {{organisation}} calling themselves Invicta Cars of Virginia Water Surrey who began making the Black Prince. Meadows engines were again used, {{this time a}} twin overhead camshaft 3-litre six with three carburettors giving 120 bhp. The aluminium-bodied cars - steel supplies were effectively non-existent for new businesses in Britain's new centrally planned economy - were extremely complex and very expensive with a torque converter (Brockhouse Hydro-Kinetic Turbo Transmitter) entirely replacing the gearbox. The torque converter was controlled by a small switch with forward and reverse positions. Suspension was fully independent using torsion bars and there were built-in electric jacks. Other innovative luxury items included a <b>trickle-charger</b> {{to charge the battery}} from the domestic mains, an immersion heater in the engine, interior heating of the body and a built-in radio. About 16 were made, 12 of which have survived. The new company lasted until 1950, when it was bought by Frazer Nash makers, AFN Ltd.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at the University of Washington introduced power over Wi-Fi, which <b>trickle-charges</b> batteries and powered battery-free cameras and temperature sensors using transmissions from Wi-Fi routers. Wi-Fi signals were shown to power battery-free temperature and camera sensors at ranges of up to 20 feet. It was also shown that Wi-Fi {{can be used to}} wirelessly <b>trickle-charge</b> nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion coin-cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet.|$|R

50|$|Sailing boats may use a water- or {{wind-powered}} generator to <b>trickle-charge</b> the batteries. A small propeller, {{wind turbine}} or impeller {{is connected to}} a low-power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.|$|R
50|$|It {{included}} a wall charger and a USB cable to <b>trickle-charge</b> through the USB interface when {{connected to a}} PC (so the wall-socket charger can be left at home). The Non-Volatile File System (NVFS), also known as NVRAM, ensured that data was never lost even if the battery was fully discharged.|$|R
5000|$|In {{switch-mode}} power supplies, {{the regulation}} circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance {{can be used}} to <b>trickle-charge</b> the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary use}} for betavoltaics is for remote and {{long-term}} use, such as spacecraft requiring electrical power {{for a decade}} or two. Recent progress has prompted some to suggest using betavoltaics to <b>trickle-charge</b> conventional batteries in consumer devices, such as cell phones and laptop computers. As early as 1973, betavoltaics were suggested for use in long-term medical devices such as pacemakers.|$|R
40|$|Cells {{operating}} at five degrees Celsius or less, {{and going to}} 60 to 65 percent depth of discharge, were studied {{as to whether they}} could achieve a useful working life of 7. 5 years in a GPS orbit. The characteristics of various orbits were compared and it is noted that the GPS orbit experiences only 220 cycles a year and must be treated as a geosynchronous rather than a low Earth orbit. Cell degradation is considered {{to be the result of}} both <b>trickle-charge</b> degradation and degradation due to cycling. Time-to-failure values are presented for selected temperatures and depth of discharges...|$|R
5000|$|Ultracapacitors—capacitors of {{extremely}} high value— are also used; an electric screwdriver which charges in 90 seconds and will drive {{about half as}} many screws as a device using a rechargeable battery was introduced in 2007, and similar flashlights have been produced. In keeping {{with the concept of}} ultracapacitors, betavoltaic batteries may be utilized as a method of providing a <b>trickle-charge</b> to a secondary battery, greatly extending the life and energy capacity of the battery system being employed; this type of arrangement {{is often referred to as}} a [...] "hybrid betavoltaic power source" [...] by those in the industry.|$|R
50|$|Duracell further {{suggests}} that a trickle charge at C/300 {{can be used for}} batteries that must be kept in a fully charged state. Some chargers do this after the charge cycle, to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends C/30 or C/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the <b>trickle-charging</b> resistor value.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{available}} {{power from the}} ISS is less than 200 kW, the ISS VASIMR would have included a <b>trickle-charged</b> battery system, allowing for 15-minute pulses of thrust. Testing of the engine on the ISS would have been valuable, because it orbits at a relatively low altitude and experiences fairly high levels of atmospheric drag, making periodic boosts of altitude necessary. Currently, altitude reboosting by chemical rockets fulfills this requirement. The VASIMR test on the ISS {{might lead to a}} capability of maintaining the ISS, or a similar space station, in a stable orbit at 1/20th of the approximately $210 million/year present estimated cost.|$|R
50|$|Flashlights {{used for}} {{extended}} periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries. Flashlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, a light kept in a vehicle may be <b>trickle-charged</b> and always ready when needed. Some rechargeable flashlights have indicators {{for the state of}} charge of the battery. Power-failure lights are designed to keep their batteries charged from a wall plug and to automatically turn on after an AC power failure; the power-failure light can be removed from the wall socket and used as a portable flashlight. Solar powered flashlights use energy from a solar cell to charge an on-board battery for later use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{present the}} first power over Wi-Fi system that {{delivers}} power to low-power sensors and devices {{and works with}} existing Wi-Fi chipsets. Specifically, we show that a ubiquitous part of wireless communication infrastruc-ture, the Wi-Fi router, can provide far field wireless power without significantly compromising the network’s commu-nication performance. Building on our design, we prototype battery-free temperature and camera sensors that we power with Wi-Fi at ranges of 20 and 17 feet respectively. We also demonstrate the ability to wirelessly <b>trickle-charge</b> nickel– metal hydride and lithium-ion coin-cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet. We deploy our system in six homes in a metropolitan area and show that it can successfully deliver power via Wi-Fi under real-world network conditions with-out significantly degrading network performance. 1...|$|R
5000|$|... {{a future}} launch of an Ad Astra VF-200 200 kW VASIMR {{electromagnetic}} thruster was under consideration for testing on the International Space Station. The VF-200 is a flight {{version of the}} VX-200. Since the available power from the ISS is less than 200 kW, the ISS VASIMR would include a <b>trickle-charged</b> battery system allowing for 15 min pulses of thrust. Testing the engine on ISS is valuable, because it orbits at a relatively low altitude and experiences fairly high levels of atmospheric drag, requiring periodic altitude boosts [...] Altitude reboosting by chemical rockets fulfills this requirement. If the tests of VASIMR reboosting goes according to plan, the increase in specific impulse could mean that the fuel cost will be one-twentieth of the current $210 million annual cost. VASMIR could reduce the amount spent of fuel for maintaining ISS altitude, using as little as 300 kg of Argon gas instead of 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel. It can use less fuel because exhaust velocity is higher, so the same acceleration is achieved with a smaller amount of propellant compared to a greater amount of fuel at a lower velocity.|$|R
40|$|A gas sensor array, {{consisting}} of seven Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors that {{are sensitive to}} a wide range of organic volatile compounds was developed to detect rotten onions during storage. These MOS sensors were enclosed in a specially designed Teflon chamber equipped with a gas delivery system to pump volatiles from the onion samples into the chamber. The electronic circuit mainly comprised a microcontroller, non-volatile memory chip, and <b>trickle-charge</b> real time clock chip, serial communication chip, and parallel LCD panel. User preferences are communicated with the on-board microcontroller through a graphical user interface developed using LabVIEW. The developed gas sensor array was characterized and the discrimination potential was tested by exposing it to three different concentrations of acetone (ketone), acetonitrile (nitrile), ethyl acetate (ester), and ethanol (alcohol). The gas sensor array could differentiate the four chemicals of same concentrations and different concentrations within the chemical with significant difference. Experiment results also showed that the system was able to discriminate two concentrations (196 and 1964 ppm) of methlypropyl sulfide and two concentrations (145 and 1452 ppm) of 2 -nonanone, two key volatile compounds emitted by rotten onions. As a proof of concept, the gas sensor array was able to achieve 89 % correct classification of sour skin infected onions. The customized low-cost gas sensor array could be a useful tool to detect onion postharvest diseases in storage...|$|R
40|$|The figure shows {{components}} of a distillation column intended for use {{as part of a}} system that produces high-purity liquid oxygen (LOX) from air by distillation. (The column could be easily modified to produce high-purity liquid nitrogen.) Whereas typical industrial distillation columns for producing high-purity liquid oxygen and/or nitrogen are hundreds of feet tall, this distillation column is less than 3 ft (less than about 0. 9 m) tall. This column was developed to <b>trickle-charge</b> a LOX-based emergency oxygen system (EOS) for a large commercial aircraft. A description of the industrial production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen by distillation is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the present miniaturized distillation column. Typically, such industrial production takes place in a chemical processing plant in which large quantities of high-pressure air are expanded in a turboexpander to (1) recover a portion of the electrical power required to compress the air and (2) partially liquefy the air. The resulting two-phase flow of air is sent to the middle of a distillation column. The liquid phase is oxygen-rich, and its oxygen purity increases as it flows down the column. The vapor phase is nitrogen-rich and its nitrogen purity increases as it flows up the column. A heater or heat exchanger, commonly denoted a reboiler, is {{at the bottom of the}} column. The reboiler is so named because its role is to reboil some of the liquid oxygen collected at the bottom of the column to provide a flow of oxygen-rich vapor. As the oxygen-rich vapor flows up the column, it absorbs the nitrogen in the down-flowing liquid by mass transfer. Once the vapor leaves the lower portion of the column, it interacts with down-flowing nitrogen liquid that has been condensed in a heat exchanger, commonly denoted a condenser, at the top of the column. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen products are obtained by draining some of the purified product at the bottom and top of the column, respectively. Because distillation is a mass-transfer process, the purity of the product(s) can be increased by increasing the effectiveness of the mass-transfer process (increasing the mass-transfer coefficient) and/or by increasing the available surface area for mass transfer through increased column height. The diameter of a distillation column is fixed by pressure-drop and mass-flow requirements. The approach taken in designing the present distillation column to be short yet capable of yielding a product of acceptably high purity was to pay careful attention to design details that affect mass-transfer processes...|$|R
