40|$|This paper defines an {{approach}} to simulation of natural systems, inspired by complex systems theory. A complex natural system is modeled as a multi-agent simulation system, agents representing living organisms, physical entities or environmental processes. Agents and their interactions can be aggregated to higher-level group agents. <b>The</b> <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> behavior of these group agents are determined by, or emerge from, <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> behavior of <b>the</b> individual agents composing the group. Group agents discover macro-level natural laws implied by <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> behavior of individual agents modeling micro-level natural entities. Such a system can be implemented in a distributed programming environment, exploiting emergence, hierarchy, and concurrency to perform large-scale simulations...|$|R
5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E

5|$|Built in {{a modernist}} style, the {{building}} {{has been the subject}} of vigorous public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider the building to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, when the State Government refused to heritage list <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower and keep it as its headquarters. Following this, the building was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, these {{religious}} {{houses were}} regarded by City traders as interlopers — occupying what had previously been public open space nearby one of the City gates. On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship.|$|E
5|$|Castle House in {{the outer}} bailey was leased to the diplomat Sir Alexander Stephen in 1901, who carried out {{extensive}} work on the property in 1904, extending and modernising {{the north end of}} the house, including constructing a billiard room and a library; he estimated the cost of the work to be around £800. Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War. One such lessee, Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around £4,000 maintaining and upgrading <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> the rentable value of the property rose from £76 to £150 over the period.|$|E

When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England's longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, {{at one point in}} the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate's farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.|$|E

5|$|German {{archaeologist}} Karl von den Steinen was {{the first}} European visitor to observe evidence of ancient dogs in the Marquesas in 1897–98. In his excavation of meʻae Iʻipona, a temple complex {{near the village of}} Puamaʻu on the northeastern coast of the island of Hiva Oa, he uncovered several stone tiki including two with zoomorphic (animal shaped) quadruped figures carved on them. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> temple site was owned by Reverend James Kekela, a Hawaiian Protestant missionary, who von den Steinen befriended. He also relied on an elderly Marquesan named Pihua, who was the only living person who knew the names of the tiki at the site.|$|E
5|$|Gilpin Gorst {{bought the}} estate in 1815 at public auction, {{and his son}} sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was {{replaced}} in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, {{as it was then}} known.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred.
