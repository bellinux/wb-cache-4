40|$|The 1960 s {{represent}} an important chapter in U. S. business history, {{partly because they}} ushered in a new tactic of corporate combination-the predatory takeover Predatory takeovers not only facilitate the restructuring of corporate enterprises, they also alter the internal structure of the business elite. We explore the factors that led large corporations to be acquired through friendly and predatory means in the 1960 s. Consistent with the "embeddedness" perspective, our {{results indicate that the}} likelihood of acquisition during this period was influenced by a firm's position in the resource-dependence network of the economy as well as the positions of its managers and directors in the firm's ownership structure and in the social network of the business elite. Specifically, firms run by central managers and directors were less susceptible to predatory takeover-ownership relationships dominated over ties among the business elite. However, consistent with <b>traditional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>accounts,</b> our results suggest that in the 1960 s undervaluation of a firm's assets, the ratio of its stock price to earnings, its performance, and its size also influenced the likelihood of acquisition. C:orporate acquisitions have important economic and political consequences. When one corporation acquires another, it often replaces the acquired firm's top managers with its own, thereby redistributing economic resources among business elites in society. It also sometimes transfers the administrative or productive assets of the acquired firm to its own headquarters or plants in different cities, thereby redistributing eco-Direct correspondence to Donald Palmer...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{differences}} in decision-making {{are important in}} both normal populations and psychiatric conditions. Variability in decision-making could be mediated by different subjective utilities or by other processes. For example, while <b>traditional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>accounts</b> attribute risk aversion to a concave subjective utility curve, in practice other factors could affect risk behavior. This distinction may {{have important implications for}} understanding the biological basis of variability in decision-making and for developing interventions to improve decision-making. Another aspect of decision-making that may vary between individuals is the sensitivity of subjective utility to counterfactual outcomes (outcomes that could have occurred, but did not). We investigated decision-making in relation to hedonic capacity and trait anxiety, two traits that relate to psychiatric conditions but also vary in the general population. Subjects performed a decision-making task, in which they chose between low- and high-risk gambles to win 0, 20, or 40 points on each trial. Subjects then rated satisfaction after each outcome on a visual analog scale, indicating subjective utility. Hedonic capacity was positively associated with the subjective utility of winning 20 points but was not associated with the concavity of the subjective utility curve (constructed using the mean subjective utility of winning 0, 20, or 40 points). Consistent with economic theory, concavity of the subjective utility curve was associated with risk aversion. Hedonic capacity was independently associated with risk seeking (i. e., not mediated by the shape of the subjective utility curve), while trait anxiety was unrelated to risk preferences. Contrary to our expectations, counterfactual sensitivity was unrelated to hedonic capacity and trait anxiety. Nevertheless, trait anxiety was associated with a self-report measure of regret-proneness, suggesting that counterfactual influences may occur via a pathway that is separate from immediate counterfactual processing biases. Taken together, our results show that hedonic capacity but not trait anxiety affects risk-taking through a mechanism that appears independent of the shape of the subjective utility curve, while hedonic capacity and trait anxiety do not affect the influence of counterfactual outcomes on subjective utility. The results have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of variable decision-making and for developing interventions to improve decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization has {{traditionally}} been understood as a byproduct of economic development, but this explanatory framework fails {{to account for the}} phenomenon of "urbanization without growth" observed in sub-Saharan Africa throughout the 1980 s and 1990 s. In light of this apparent anomaly, I argue that urbanization is better understood as a global historical process driven by population dynamics associated with technological and institutional innovations that have substantially improved disease control and food security in urban settlements across the globe. These innovations first emerged in Europe in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} and were subsequently diffused through colonialism, trade, and international development assistance. A range of qualitative and quantitative evidence is presented to demonstrate that this historically grounded theory of urbanization offers a more convincing explanation for the stylized facts of Africa's urban transition-and hence the process of world urbanization more broadly-than the <b>traditional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>account...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{comparative}} study of European time transfers reveals {{the full extent of}} transfers in the form of unpaid work and highlights the existence of important gender differences in household time production. A large quantity of goods and services are produced by household members for their own consumption, without involving market transactions. Despite the economic and social importance of unpaid work, these productive activities are largely invisible to <b>traditional</b> national <b>economic</b> <b>accounts.</b> As a consequence, standard measures of intergenerational transfers typically ignore household production, and thus underestimate the overall value of goods and services produced over the life cycle; in particular, the economic contribution of females. The book uses a life course approach to offer policy-relevant insights into the effect of demographic and social change on intergenerational ties and gender inequality in household production...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays the {{strategies}} of the agricultural and environmental policies (the Lisbon strategy "EU 2020 ") -in particular the Sixth Environment Action Programme 2010 : Our Future, Our Choice- highlight the {{need to create a}} market more environmentally friendly and "responsible". The recent debate shows that the "green" variable in financial management is put {{at the center of the}} reflections of employers in both the discretionary dimensional (culture, ethics and responsibility) and in the normative-prescriptive dimension. Some positive experiences bring out the following topics: 1) the approaches of multifunctional agriculture in synergy with the themes of the European debate about the Corporate Social Responsibility, 2) the definition of a new business framework, 3) the management model oriented to the stakeholders and to the ethical management. The vision of the entrepreneur green in managing the company is an innovative point of view with respect to the obligations of law and falls within the sphere "responsible" for environmental management. The literature, in fact, focuses on: 1) a responsible model of business management through "stakeholder" model, as opposed to the "shareholder model", where the creation of value is not confined to equity holders of risk, but companies assume the management objectives that bring mutual benefit to the community; 2) the development of specific items in the analysis of financial statements that takes into account aspects of environmental responsability. According to this, the paper aims to analyze the application of principles of the "responsible" management process to an Italian case study: the scenario of enhancement of historical farmhouses system in Volpiano (Canavese in metropolitan area of Turin, Italy). This territory is paradigmatic, as it is characterized by the coexistence the historical rural settlement patterns (partially altered by the construction of roads infrastructure) with new housing and productive settlement systems: it is an issue of great importance not only local. As a first step, the paper aims reviewing the large literature (Carroll, 1991; Freeman et al, 2007) on the subject of Corporate Social Responsibility. It follows a reflection of the strengths and weaknesses of similar operations: the development of structural frameworks of knowledge of rural landscapes and its settlements, the operational aspects of evaluation and feasibility tests with the introduction of environmental items in the <b>traditional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>accounting</b> approach (the green value in the International Standards). The concept of multifunctional agriculture, conceived as agriculture that produces primary goods, on the other as agriculture that produces secondary services. The second step is to elaborate the specific Financial Management Analysis Model for the enhancement of the historical farmhouses, where particular attention was paid to two technical steps: 1) mapping of the stakeholders in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility approach; 2) the identification of specific items in the financial statements (in these phase of testing only at the categorial and descriptive level). In fact, the final project scenario was checked with traditional instruments for operational feasibility analysis, foreseeing: the functional recovery and the restoration of the farms, the traditional culture with fodder crops and "new" (hazel) and the creation of spaces for the use of agriculture and animal husbandry as a source of therapy, education and ennobling. Some specific reflections were drawn on the estimate of the investment costs for the restoration and re-functioning, on the timing of site preparation and the management data, and on the identification of financing channels (PSR and the European CAP). Finally, the feasibility conditions are linked to the economic social responsibility and presents elements of originality in the feasibility test performance and the new assumptions on the risk/return ratio...|$|R

40|$|Increases in {{national}} income are usually treated as economic growth. If {{large enough to}} produce increases in per capita income, they are generally considered as welfare enhancing. Yet, at the same time, these increases {{in national}} income might be accompanied by severe destructions of the most fundamentally scarce resource at man's disposal, the environment.

Conventional methods of national accounting are no exception, in that only market transactions are recorded.
