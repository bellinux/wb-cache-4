2500|$|The Voitenko {{compressor}} initially separates a <b>test</b> <b>gas</b> from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of {{its energy}} {{is focused on the}} steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the <b>test</b> <b>gas</b> ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A [...] shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal [...] The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.|$|E
