40|$|The {{potential}} for vertical tax competition is strongest when {{different levels of}} government share the same base. Because there is greater sharing of common tax bases in Canada than in the United States, we expect vertical tax competition to be weaker in the United States than in Canada. Econometric analysis of US data supports this hypothesis. Taking account of the deductibility-related endogeneity of federal <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> by state, federal income <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> {{have no effect on}} average state income <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> Introducing distributional considerations into the vertical tax competition model, we do find a significant displacement effect for higher income taxpayers, with higher federal burdens associated with lower state income <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> in the highest income quintile.

40|$|I {{study the}} effects of CEOs' unrealized capital gains <b>tax</b> {{liabilities}} (<b>tax</b> <b>burdens)</b> on corporate risk-taking. Recent work suggests that high <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> discourage CEOs from selling stock. I hypothesize that this causes the executives to become overexposed to firm-specific risk thereby reducing their willingness to make risky corporate decisions. In a series of tests, I find that corporate risk-taking decreases as CEOs' personal <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> increase. Further, firms with CEOs who are more locked-in to their stock positions (i. e., CEOs with higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens)</b> experience larger increases in risk-taking following federal and state tax cuts. When I investigate the mechanism behind this relation, I find that tax cuts trigger stock sales by the locked-in executives, allowing for improved diversification. Overall, my findings indicate that the personal <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> of CEOs affect the firm by reducing executives' preferences for risk at the corporate level. by Benjamin Peter Yost.

In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the <b>tax</b> <b>burden.</b>|$|E

5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system.

5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} model (3) of Table  5 {{suggest that the}} overall {{relationship}} between tax progressivity and revenue volatility is weak and even counterintuitive. Higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> {{at the very top}} of the income distribution do increase the potential fiscal risk from recession in those states where income at the top is very volatile. However, empirically the actual effect is small on average, because most states with high exposure at the top do not impose high <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> on that group. The three states with the highest burdens on the top 5 percent -- California, New York, and New Jersey -- also had very large negative income shocks, due to the concentration of income and -- in California and New York -- large shares of capital gains at the top; but they are exceptional cases. Most states with large income shocks to the top 5 percent have below-average <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> on this group, which reduces the impact on tax revenues. Moreover, in the next 15 percent of the distribution, higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> are associated with reduced revenue volatility at the mean income shock. Thus higher burdens in the top 20 percent of the income distribution, which are associated with a less regressive tax structure, did not increase overall tax volatility during the Great Recession.|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{can alter}} the {{structure}} of tax systems and lead to higher real <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> The ‘automatic stabiliser’ argument assumes that increasing <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> reduce consumption and thereby aggregate demand, acting as an automatic stabiliser which helps to ‘cool down’ the economy in times of inflation. This argument, however, only looks at the demand side, ignoring any effects that higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> may have {{on the cost of}} production. If employees bear less then the full <b>burden</b> of higher <b>taxes</b> then real labour costs will also go up, generating a cost-push upwards pressure on prices and opening up the possibility of a wage-price spiral. I compute distributions of inflation induced changes of marginal and average effective tax rates for four European countries using a preliminary version of EUROMOD, a European tax-benefit model. Possible wage effects of these changes are then discussed in an imperfect labour market framework. ...|$|R
5|$|The Khurasani {{tax system}} had been {{established}} {{at the time of}} the Muslim conquest and remained unchanged since. It relied on the collection of a fixed tribute by the local non-Muslim (mostly Zoroastrian) gentry, the dihqans, who often discriminated against the Muslim settlers and the native converts. This contributed to the latter's increasing resentment of Umayyad rule, and the demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of Ibn Surayj. Consequently, Nasr streamlined the tax system in 739, implementing a blanket imposition (the kharaj) on all owners of agricultural land and forcing the non-Muslims to pay an additional poll tax (the jizyah). In this way, the chroniclers report, 30,000 Muslims were absolved of the jizyah, and 80,000 non-Muslims were forced to pay it instead. Attention was also paid to the accurate collection of the kharaj in accordance with treaties with the local rulers, as a result of which the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> was generally eased. This reform is traditionally held to have assisted in regaining the loyalty of the local populations and their princes, who returned quickly to the Arab fold; other modern scholars however consider the effect of this belated reform on the prevailing anti-Umayyad climate as minimal. Upon his appointment, Nasr also moved the provincial capital back to Merv from Balkh, where Asad had established it. Additionally, for the first time in the province's history he appointed sub-governors. They were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward them and to improve his own control of the province.|$|E
