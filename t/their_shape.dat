It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E

5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles.

Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum.

5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E

5|$|If two {{cells of}} the same type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The {{conditions}} which trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba.

5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> to generate a propulsive force.|$|E

5|$|Two large tomb stelae made {{of granite}} {{were found at}} his burial site. <b>Their</b> <b>shape</b> is unusual and they appear {{unfinished}} and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru ("beloved of the gods"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists {{to the conclusion that}} the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity ("king of Lower- and Upper Egypt") instead.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably subglacial volcanoes, take <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type they produced. The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically active area in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to the}} direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E

5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> – a curtain wall was constructed around {{the outside of the}} castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on <b>their</b> <b>shape</b> and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E
