40|$|The hotel {{industry}} is {{deeply embedded in}} local regional conditions, though the influence of regional factors is seldom investigated. Three key {{hotel industry}} metrics, Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Room Rate (ARR), and rooms rented, were examined for their determinants using ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression models on key endogenous and exogenous (regional) factors, including Destination Attractiveness and Capacity, Business and Commercial Environment, Image and Openness, and <b>Tourism</b> <b>Professional</b> Specialization. Using China as a case study, and at different hotel star designations (2 - to 5 -star hotels), {{the results show that}} RevPAR is determined mainly by labor quality and <b>Tourism</b> <b>Professional</b> Specialization. Particularly, regional factors significantly affect ARR and rooms rented. The influence and sophistication of regional factors increases with higher star designations. This paper highlights links between the hospitality industry and regional economic development, which should be considered by both the hotel industry and tourism policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Agriculture is a {{critical}} part of Nebraska’s economy, and changes in the fortunes of agriculture {{play an important role in}} the success of the state’s non-metropolitan regions. Trends toward consolidation and rising productivity in agriculture, however, have raised concerns about the future of non-metropolitan Nebraska. Some citizens and policymakers have begun to wonder if the economy can create sufficient job opportunities for non-metropolitan residents. The answer to this question depends not only upon the relative strength of the agricultural sector, but also upon the presence of other industries that can join agriculture as pillars for employment growth in non-metropolitan Nebraska. This study, sponsored by the University of Nebraska Rural Initiative, brings together researchers from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and Creighton University to examine multiple dimensions of Nebraska’s non-metropolitan economy. In addition to agriculture, we will examine the fortunes of five other key industries: 1) manufacturing, 2) tourism, 3) trucking, 4) professional and technical services, and 5) information. This list contains industries that are traditional areas of rural economic development such as manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism, but also includes rapidly expanding industries in our state (trucking) or industries within a rapidly changing national economy (professional and technical services and information). National economic forecasts suggest that industries such as trucking, <b>tourism,</b> <b>professional</b> and technical services, and information will continue to add employment at a moderate to rapid pace over the next decade...|$|E
40|$|Natural disasters, {{wars and}} conflicts, epidemics, {{and other major}} crises can devastate a tourism service or destination. Though there is {{extensive}} literature and research on preparation and coping with tourism crises, there is a gap in {{information on how to}} best market to recover from the destruction of business. This book fills this gap by comprehensively examining how to rebuild the market for a tourism service or destination after a catastrophe. This important book presents leading experts from around the world providing useful instruction on effective ways to plan for future crisis response and strategies for recovering business. A crisis can come from several types of destructive occurrences, from natural physical destruction of important infrastructure to acts of terrorism. Because of the broad range of potential problems, there is no single strategy for which to deal with crises. The book explores a wide range of catastrophes, from Hurricane Katrina to tsunamis to war, taking a detailed look at management and administrative strategies which can help stimulate tourism recovery. This book explores stealth and catastrophic risks, risk perceptions, mediating the effects of natural disasters on travel intention, and various marketing strategies designed to bring customers back. This volume may {{become one of the most}} crucial resources in a <b>tourism</b> <b>professional</b> 2 ̆ 7 s library. The book is extensively referenced and includes several tables and figures to clearly explain data. This book is essential reading for tourism researchers, tourism educators, tourism industry managers, and tourism industry administrators.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{understand}} how residents perceive tourism impacts. Based on the review of the literature in the area of tourism, in particular with regard to its development and to the residents’ perceptions and attitudes towards this phenomenon, we studied the case of the municipality of Loulé, a privileged area of the tourist destination Algarve. The study adopts the residents’ point of view, a perspective still with much to explore when it comes to tourism. It analyses the relationship between variables such as the perception of social, economic, cultural and environmental impacts in people’s personal lives and in the area of residence, type and frequency of contact with <b>tourism,</b> <b>professional</b> and economic dependence on tourism and demographic characteristics. The results show that although residents identify, as the literature suggests, negative impacts of tourism, in general, they also acknowledge the importance of the tourism development in their area of residence and in their personal lives. It is noted that residents perceive tourism impacts differently according to professional and economic dependence on tourism activity, the proximity of the place of residence to the main tourist area and the frequency and type of contact with tourism. Demographic factors are not the most significant in explaining the perception of tourism impacts. The results of the study reinforce the importance of considering the residents’ perceptions vis-à-vis the tourism as a decisive factor in the sustainable development of tourism destinations, being thus residents one of the key stakeholders in the context of a holistic and integrated approach to tourism planning and development...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) As {{the demand}} for {{adventure}} tourism in national parks increases, the number of adventure tour operators also increases, and the debate regarding their presence in national parks ensues. Conservation then competes with adventure tourism supply and as such is of growing concern to national parks management, particularly in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This thesis focuses on the operators’ subjective interpretation of adventure tourism supply in NSW national parks, and explores why the operators have particular foci in and perspectives on the supply of adventure tourism in national parks. This thesis draws on role theory and selected motivational theories {{as a foundation for}} exploring values and behaviours. A qualitative case study design was employed and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 adventure tour operators based in four NSW national parks. Research results indicated that the interviewed operators were motivated by multiple factors, with lifestyle being the overarching and most important motivator driving them to engage in the supply of adventure tourism in national parks. This thesis found the operators played a variety of roles in the supply of adventure tourism in national parks. These roles were played out in relation to their concerns for clients, the natural environment and their businesses. The role of being an adventure <b>tourism</b> <b>professional</b> was the most salient identity for most operators in this thesis. This thesis also found participants ultimately placed their businesses at the centre of their value systems. Therefore, operators’ endeavours with regard to conservation were not initiated from a concern for the natural environment, but, rather a concern for their businesses. Despite this central focus the operators expressed strong biocentric values and a strong desire to contribute to conservation of national parks. The findings of this thesis were examined in light of this juxtaposition between business values and conservation values and how these impacted operators’ decisions and behaviours. This thesis concludes by examining how the findings challenge current approaches to the management of tourism in national parks and makes recommendations for further research...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{tourism and}} rural {{development}} are much examined research areas. Within these, {{the importance of}} community-centric approaches {{is becoming more and}} more recognised; however, specific research upon which community-centric development strategies could be built seems to be lacking. This thesis addresses this research gap with the aim to explore the nature of co-operative tourism and its potential towards sustainable rural tourism development in India from a stakeholder perspective. A literature review demonstrated the benefits of co-operatives as a sustainable business model, particularly for poor communities of developing countries; however, a clear gap emerged with regard to investigating tourism and co-operatives in the same context. This research contributes to filling this gap in knowledge and outlines the clear theoretical benefits of adopting a co-operative business model as a community-centric approach to tourism in the context of rural India, while also pointing out considerable challenges in its practical implementation, such as possible limitations to the ability for self-help. Fifty qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with stakeholders of a co-operative tourism project in two states of India: Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Twenty-six of these were conducted with farmers who are members of the tourism co-operatives presented in this study, ten with members of the wider community in which the project took place and fourteen with <b>tourism</b> <b>professional</b> and academics local to the areas. Focus was put on in-depth exploration of participants’ experiences, implying qualitative methods and a phenomenological research approach. The findings revealed a clear theoretical advantage of a co-operative approach to tourism development, which has potential to address and alleviate many of the challenges associated with tourism and host communities, and which is intensified in poor peripheral areas. However, there are significant practical challenges, which need to be addressed in order for this comparative advantage to translate into practice. These challenges are manifested in a sense of dormancy in the participants, a lack of skills and significant language difficulties. A limit to the principle of self-help, which is inherent to co-operative activities, was identified as creating effective marketing links and hence, requiring ongoing external support. This research study makes an interdisciplinary contribution to the literature on sustainable tourism, rural development and co-operative studies. In addition, it provides a starting point for further empirical research on the co-operative business model as an approach, which has not yet been sufficiently conceptualised for tourism. Furthermore, it contributes to the wider debate on sustainable rural development through tourism. Future research could usefully investigate how the challenges identified in this study, such as limitations to the principle of self-help, lack of initiative in participants and creating marketing linkages could be addressed...|$|E
