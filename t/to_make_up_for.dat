5|$|Arizona {{was the one}} {{approved}} battleship for {{the fiscal}} year 1914. Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer had requested three battleships for that fiscal year, citing the former policy of building two per year, plus an additional ship <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> authorizing only Pennsylvania in the previous year, but congressional compromises once again approved only one new battleship. Arizona was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly, on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly.

5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment.

The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|Chicago's defense {{allowed the}} 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100yards per {{game on the}} ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team. The line was {{anchored}} by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, {{two of the three}} Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminology}} in {{the literature}} surrounding this subject is somewhat confusedâ€”the term aerospike was originally used for a truncated plug nozzle with a very rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an [...] "air spike" [...] <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> {{the absence of the}} plug tail. However, frequently, a full-length plug nozzle is now called an aerospike.|$|R
50|$|Alltag is {{important}} because it depicted the realistic interaction between punk, alternative subcultures and the Gastarbeiter (guest workers invited to Germany in 1960s and 70s <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> post war labor shortage) in Germany. The film shows that these subcultures create identities that mix Turkish, German and African-American culture and sets an environment for the growth of Hip-hop in Germany.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} of 22 May, United had a bye week from league play, which allowed the club to {{schedule}} a home friendly against the defending Dutch champions, AFC Ajax of Amsterdam. The previous week, Ajax had tallied a 3â€“1 win over Twente to secure the Dutch title for an unprecedented 30th time, their first since 2004. The Amsterdamers notched an early strike in the 10th minute thanks to forward, and Serbian international, Miralem Sulejmani. The Black-and-Red managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the early setback thanks to a 58th-minute cross from Ngwenya to newly drafted Blake Brettschneider, leveling the match at one apiece. However, the match ended in Ajax's favor over United as the Amsterdammers tallied a final goal in the 87th minute courtesy of midfielder Vurnon Anita.|$|E
5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, and scores of machine guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E
