50|$|The {{reduction}} of taxes meant keeping {{a larger share}} of the local surplus crop production. In consequence, regardless of the theoretical framework that governed the land ownership and political regime of the Ottoman Empire, the lands of Metsovo were gradually falling under the absolute possession, ownership, and management of its residents, which corresponded to political self-governance. This development had a cost. Every year, the corresponding <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>contributions</b> had to be pre-paid to the Ottoman landlord of the area, otherwise the Chora or Mukataa of Metsovo could lose its status and be combined with neighboring Ottoman regions.|$|E
40|$|Governmental {{public debt}} is {{determined}} by the State’s financial needs that display a permanent character. The State’s financial needs are covered by cashed incomes coming from <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>contributions.</b> The State’s incomes and the opportunity of obtaining them are almost never enough large in order to cover all the expenditures of a period (as a rule, one year). Such a lack of resources determines the turning up of certain budget deficits whose covering is done owing to internal or external loans. All the sums loaned and not refunded at a certain moment determines the appearance of the public debt of a country. Public debt consists in the total sums borrowed by the central public authorities, by the administrative and territory units, and contracted or guaranteed by the other public entities, from natural or juridical persons on the internal market or from abroad and not refunded at a certain moment. Governmental public debt represents the State’s total financial obligations at a certain moment coming from refunding financings directly contracted or guaranteed by the Government on financial markets. During a period when most of the countries have to face the challenges determined by the lack of sustaining internal and external public debt, we consider that the problems generated by administrating public debt mainly focus upon the impact of the present financial crisis upon the level of the public debt and upon the manner of administrating it...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to such topical issue of Criminal Law as Object and Subject of Evasion of <b>Taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> Compulsory Payments. There are {{analyzed}} researched crime determination problems, which are connected with subject <b>and</b> object of <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> compulsory payments evasion. In {{the course of the}} research, the author has made the conclusions that the object of the evasion of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> compulsory payments group is the national economic interests. The direct object is the national economic interests in the sphere of state revenues or the national fiscal interests. While analyzing the law and regulations it is concluded that the subject of the evasion of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> compulsory payments is the tax base (income, property, expenses <b>and</b> consumption), <b>taxes,</b> state <b>and</b> local government fees, as well as other payments determined by the State. The author has also concluded that the subject of the evasion of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> compulsory payments does not include increase in the tax principal debt, fine and late charge, which are covered by the financial responsibility. The subject of the evasion of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> compulsory payments may not include also income from illegal activity or proceeds resulting from criminal offences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to those held in the Database at Leicester in the directory /obrien/*. *. These data on English revenues, 1485 - 1815, have been prepared by Professor P. K. O'Brien, Director of the Institute for Historical Research and by Dr P. A. Hunt. Discussion of the English fiscal data in this period can most conveniently be found in Professor O'Brien's chapter in Bonney, The rise of the fiscal state in Europe, forthcoming, 1994.
