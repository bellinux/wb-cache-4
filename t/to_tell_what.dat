Because Natsuki barely talks at all, and is usually emotionless, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> she is thinking. The most important person to her is Kanade, her only friend.

25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly it is very hard for audiences <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 17 years, Gandalf {{travelled}} extensively, searching for answers on the Ring. He found some answers in Isildur's scroll, {{in the archives}} of Minas Tirith. But he also wanted to interview Gollum, who had borne the Ring for many years. Gandalf searched long and widely for Gollum, and often had the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeded, and Gandalf questioned Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proved unwilling to speak. Gandalf learned finally that Sauron had forced Gollum under torture in Barad-dûr <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> he knew of the Ring. This reinforced Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring.|$|E

25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See Phaistos Disc decipherment claims).|$|E
25|$|Dolomedes are nocturnal hunters, feeding when birds, {{their main}} predators, are sleeping. The method {{they use to}} fish for insects is {{to hold on to}} the shore with their back legs while the rest of their body lies on the water, with legs {{stretched}} out. Dolomedes species tend to be robust with thickset legs that allow them to tackle prey larger than themselves. They stretch out their front legs and wait, as if listening. Their front legs feel the vibrations carried on the water, just as other spiders feel the vibrations in a web. They are able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> is causing the vibrations that the water is carrying - to distinguish the drawn-out, erratic vibrations of a struggling insect from the one-off vibrations caused by falling leaves or the background noise of the wind or the flow of the water around rocks and other obstacles. As well as identifying the source of the vibrations, the spiders are also able to discern the distance to and direction of the source. To this end they have a range of vibration-detecting organs, including very sensitive hairs (trichobothria) on their legs and feet. Their eyes play a secondary role - experiments on related species show that touch is the main sense these spiders use to catch their prey. Their eyes are of little use for nocturnal hunting. These vibration detectors also serve to warn the spider of predators such as trout.|$|E

Dumbfounded, Luan Da attempted to continue his lies; however, the emperor called for the spy to come forth and expose the lies. [...] Lost for words, Luan Da was arrested on Emperor Wu's order, and executed by having his body chopped into two at the waist. [...] The emperor extended his fury to the Marquess of Lecheng for introducing Luan Da, having him beheaded and his body then defiled.|$|E
500|$|Partial {{recording}} of the album took place during September 2010, at Conway Studios with Dr. Luke again as the executive producer. Kesha recorded the abundance of Cannibal over a two-week span {{with a variety of}} producers; the short recording period was due to her only being available for a limited amount of time due to prior commitments. During an interview with Billboard conducted by Chris Willman, one of the potential songs for the album was used {{as an example of how}} Luke and Kesha collaborated to create a song for this record: [...] "There's an unfinished chorus on this new track, in which Gottwald is singing through such distorted Auto-Tune, it's impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> he's saying-which is deliberate, so he won't unduly influence Ke$ha when she comes up with her own lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{interpreted}} the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted {{to be about}} freedom. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{said that in the}} song, Lee is [...] "trying to convince a romantic partner to stop 'spiraling down, down, down' and help her find a new beginning." [...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "West Coast" [...] {{was directed by}} Vincent Haycock, and shot at Marina del Rey, California and in Venice, Los Angeles, in early April 2014. Aside from Del Rey, the clip also features Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney who plays the singer's love interest in the clip's chorus segment, and American model Bradley Soileau who plays the same role in another scene. Del Rey described Mahoney as her confidante, lover and procurer in the video. In an interview with Clash, the singer mentioned, [...] "Like the record, [...] atmospheric, and you catch a directional vibe, but it's not that pointed, and it's hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> is going on". She attained inspiration for the clip from the Chet Baker documentary Let's Get Lost (1988), and her love of the red dress effect. The singer also wanted the video to be mood-driven, and for its final scene, to transcend from black-and-white imagery to a [...] "HD color dream scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her {{daughter}} Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family. PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I do not know how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 years, my fatherland and not to find anyone for whom I cared." ...|$|E
