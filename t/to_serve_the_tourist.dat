25|$|The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 {{although}} the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley (now the tea rooms) and passengers were taken {{the rest of}} the way by omnibus. A station was built in the town, close to the existing one, in 1862 and was served by a branch line from Ringwood. Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883 and a new station was built. The branch line to Ringwood remained open until 1935. The arrival of the railways affected maritime trade. As the century passed, more and more imports came by rail and less by sea. By 1906 the trade had all but finished. In 1908 Christchurch Council rebuilt and refendered the Town Quay which then became the centre for the many pleasure boat companies that had grown <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> trade.

40|$|How {{informal}} sector creates innovation in gaining competition {{is very important}} in urban management. Commonly, {{informal sector}}s are embedded in their routines and lack of innovation capacities. Based on the case of becak wisata in Yogyakarta, it was found that as informal sector in tourism activity, the becak wisata drivers have created product innovation. This street level of innovation is mainly done by seeing <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> as <b>the</b> potential demand/profitable customers. They have created innovation on physical performance of the pedicab, the capacity of pedicab <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourists,</b> and <b>the</b> union as the organization of the becak wisata. Furthermore the “becak wisata” has transformed not only as a transportation mode but also as one of tourism attraction. This product innovation is also supported by process innovation through networking with formal sector such as government agencies and hotel...|$|R

5000|$|Lake Delton, Wisconsin Dells's sister {{city to the}} south, {{gradually}} became popular as the Dells attractions spread out.

Following the show's huge success in the city, its owner, Tommy Bartlett, chose to keep the performance permanently in Wisconsin Dells.

50|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to the Oulipo group, the {{imposition}} of arbitrary restrictions <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> heighten <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> experience.

The Hotel del Coronado was built in March 1887, with Babcock's visions for the hotel built around a {{courtyard}} of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers, with a dining wing to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay and city. By 1915, more hotels were built along the Los Angeles coastline <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> wealthy <b>tourists</b> and Hollywood film makers. In May of 1926, brothers E.A.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the London and North Western Railway {{was one of}} the main {{railways}} in Britain, and operated almost all services along the North Wales coast. The LNWR developed plans for two branch lines on Anglesey in 1897: one to Beaumaris (which was abandoned), and another <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> growing <b>tourist</b> trade of Benllech. This line was to connect with the main line at Llanfairpwll, but William Jones MP advocated a connection at Llangefni, on the Anglesey Central Railway (operated by then as a branch line of the LNWR). A compromise was reached with the line connecting at Holland Arms, near Pentre Berw, as authorised by Act of Parliament in 1899. The intended terminus was now to be in the nearby village of Red Wharf Bay, giving a slightly shorter route. This was changed by a further act of 1900 to a crossroads over half a mile (0.8 km) from Red wharf Bay and a mile (1.6 km) from Benllech, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> both villages. <b>The</b> terminus was called [...] "Red Wharf Bay and Benllech", often abbreviated to [...] "Red Wharf Bay".|$|R
