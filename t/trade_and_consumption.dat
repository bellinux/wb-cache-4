Economics focuses on {{measurable}} variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E

The harvest was the most intensive in the world. In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota.|$|E

In February 1942 he announced the pegging of wages and profits, the introduction of controls on production, <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> to reduce private spending, and the transfer of surplus personal income to savings and war loans. On 15 April 1942 more price controls were introduced. On 23 July a uniform income tax, giving the Commonwealth a monopoly in this vital field, was attained when the States were defeated in the High Court of Australia.|$|E

The study covers the period of 1980 - 2010. We have applied panel cointegration to examine long run relationship between the variables. The direction of causal relationship between trade openness is investigated by applying Homogenous non-causality, Homogenous causality and Heterogeneous causality tests. Our variables are integrated at I(1) confirmed by time series and panel unit root tests and cointegration is found between <b>trade</b> openness <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The relationship between <b>trade</b> openness <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is inverted U-shaped in high income countries but U-shaped in middle and low income countries. The homogenous and non-homogenous causality analysis reveals the bidirectional causality between <b>trade</b> openness <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> This paper opens up new insights for policy makers to design a comprehensive economic, <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> policies for sustainable economic growth in long run following heterogeneous causality findings. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find an explicit characterization of model parameters for the well-posedness of the problem, and show that the problem is well-posed if and only if there exists a shadow price process. Finally, we describe how the investor's optimal strategy is affected by the additional opportunity of trading the liquid risky asset, compared to the simpler model with one bond and one illiquid risky asset...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{informal}} economies of post socialism as they are practiced in two rural communities {{on either side of}} the Ukrainian-Romanian border, which are now dependent on migrant worker remittances, cross-border small <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> a wide range of non-market economic practices for not only daily but also long-term survival or social reproduction. As informal economic practices have been sustained and even proliferated in the region, the thesis responds to a need to understand how local communities produce, embed and give meaning to these everyday, routinised practices in the borderlands. The thesis therefore addresses two key questions: How are informal economies in the Ukrainian-Romanian borderlands practiced?; How do communities construct and embed meanings for these practices? The themes of language, citizenship, gender and marriage enable us to understand the processes through which the practices are discursively and performatively given meaning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Whereas {{roots of}} {{globalization}} are far reaching, {{it is primarily}} a modern age phenomenon. Modern business operation and the world economy are characterized by domination of multinational corporations, strong presence {{of the government in}} economy and the long-term tendency towards globalization in manufacturing, <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> in the world. Containing both risks and opportunities, globalization is a problem of manifold nature. For some it means regression and falling into “neocolonialism”, the others glorify it. It is logical to ask the following questions: What are the consequences of globalization for governments, nations, companies and individuals? What are the business, social and ethical issues it causes? In one word, is it possible to be ethical, to avoid and correct “bad ” and keep “good ” consequences of total phenomena as the globalization, and whether it is rewarding in the increasing market competition...|$|R

5000|$|An economy (From Greek οίκος - [...] "household" [...] and νęμoμαι - [...] "manage") {{is an area}} of the production, distribution, or <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> {{of goods}} and {{services}} by different agents in a given geographical location in various countries.

40|$|The {{opening of}} borders in eastern Europe, {{accompanied}} by partial re-regulation and institutionalization of markets, created exceptional conditions for arbitrage {{in the form}} of cross-border trading. Whilst there is evidence that this is in decline in Central Eastern Europe, because of developments in the formal retail sector <b>and</b> convergence in <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption,</b> it persists as a significant alternative economic site in many other parts of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This article explores three main aspects of cross-border trading in Trans-Carpathian Ukraine, a region at the frontier between 'colliding' economic systems. The article has three main objectives. First, it examines the roles of gatekeepers and operators, and their embeddedness in local economic and political systems. Secondly, based on a survey of 150 Ukrainian traders, it explores the socio-economic backgrounds and practices of the traders, especially gender differences, their modes of <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> capital accumulation. These are partly interpreted in terms of the uneven legacy of capital and social networks dating from the state socialist period. Thirdly, it considers the changing organizational forms of trading, especially a shift from petty cross-border trading to global sourcing of merchandise.
