5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E

5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E

Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E

5|$|Little {{more can}} be said of Padarn, though he later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed details of his life.

Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E

5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of}} the rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E
5|$|The Paperboys (sometimes billed and {{credited}} as Tom Landa and the Paperboys) are a Canadian {{folk music}} band from Vancouver that formed in 1991. The Paperboys blend Celtic folk with bluegrass, Mexican, Eastern European, African, zydeco, soul and country influences. The band {{has had a}} variety of members and line-ups since its original formation, with Landa remaining as the sole founding member, although veteran banjoist/bassist Cam Salay often returns as a guest performer.

5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae {{was first}} {{collected}} in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 {{as a full}} species of Oryzomys. It was retained as a distinct species related to O.couesi and O.palustris until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz swept it, and other outlying populations {{of the same species}} group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of O.palustris. Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition (1981) of Mammals of North America, arguing that O.peninsulae differed less from mainland Oryzomys populations (currently classified as O.couesi mexicanus) <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> forms he included in O.palustris differed from each other. After studies of the contact zone between North American O.palustris and Central American O.couesi in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) made clear that the two are distinct from each other, O.peninsulae remained as a subspecies of O.couesi. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican Oryzomys and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct Oryzomys species in the region. O.peninsulae and another isolated population, O.nelsoni from the Islas Marías, were both retained as separate species, as was O.albiventer from montane mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, O.couesi mexicanus, of Oryzomys couesi.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E

25|$|Sovereigns {{usually have}} a higher premium {{to the price of}} gold <b>than</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> bullion coins, such as the Krugerrand.
