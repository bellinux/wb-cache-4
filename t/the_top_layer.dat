5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer.</b> Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi.

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The pileipellis, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick. The stipitipellis, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis {{is made up}} of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick.

They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% of the coffee trees under three years old, and 20% of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 were blocked in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections were blocked in St. Andrew, 43 roads were blocked in St. Catherine, eight roads were blocked in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 roads were blocked in the Northeast region.|$|E

The study reveals that the energy imparted in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> of <b>the</b> liquid in the vacuum ladle is less effective in promoting mixing.
