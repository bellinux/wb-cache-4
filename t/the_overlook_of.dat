40|$|Compressive sensing (CS) is a {{promising}} technology for realizing energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality {{when dealing with}} physiological signals due to inaccurate models and <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10 x, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86 % against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15 dB over conventional model-driven approaches.

40|$|Focal {{point of}} this conference is to examine urban {{patterns}} and city structures regarding the changing needs of people in their everyday life. In order to do so, involved stakeholders such as planners and decision makers need to have precise information about citizens ’ needs and feelings concerning actual difficulties or tasks. Thus, approaches are needed to identify such topics, and to evaluate urban processes. One potential for {{this can be seen}} in new developments like Ubiquitous Computing and pervasive sensing with mobile devices which can act as small and connected sensors in the spatial environment. Due to the increasing prevalence of such mobile devices, more and more geospatial data is being produced, and some of it allows for inferring information about people’s behaviour in specific areas. The main problems in these tasks are on one side that the processing of such data is a difficult task, due to the heterogeneity of interfaces and used data formats, but also because of the absence of a target-oriented question and <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> the potential for spatial and urban planning. We consider mobile crowdsourcing approaches to gather data in combination with the potentials of ubiquitous computing via new generation smartphones with the RADAR SENSING app as a promising approach.

40|$|Abstract Background Some {{patients}} under close colonoscopic surveillance still develop colorectal cancer, thus suggesting <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> colorectal adenoma by endoscopists. AFI detects colorectal adenoma as a clear magenta, {{therefore the}} efficacy of AFI is expected to improve the detection ability of colorectal adenoma. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine {{the efficacy of}} AFI in detecting colorectal adenoma. Methods This study enrolled 88 patients who underwent colonoscopy at Asahikawa Medical University and Kushiro Medical Association Hospital. A randomly selected colonoscopist first observed the sigmoid colon and rectum with conventional high resolution endosopy (HRE). Then the colonoscopist changed the mode to AFI and handed to the scope to another colonoscopist who knew no information about the HRE. Then the second colonoscopist observed the sigmoid colon and rectum. Each colonoscopist separately recorded the findings. The detection rate, miss rate and procedural time were assessed in prospective manner. Results The detection rate of flat and depressed adenoma, but not elevated adenoma, by AFI is significantly higher than that by HRE. In less-experienced endoscopists, AFI dramatically increased the detection rate (30. 3 %) and reduced miss rate (0 %) of colorectal adenoma in comparison to those of HRE (7. 7 %, 50. 0 %), but not for experienced endoscopists. The procedural time of HRE was significantly shorter than that of AFI. Conclusions AFI increased the detection rate and reduced the miss rate of flat and depressed adenomas. These advantages of AFI were limited to less-experienced endoscopists because experienced endoscopists exhibited a substantially high detection rate for colorectal adenoma with HRE. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study focusses on the {{importance}} of etymology and comparative philology in defining conceptual units designated by Arabic terminological units. This endeavour can be achieved by comparing the constitutive roots from which the Arabic terminological units have been derived to their comparable roots in Semitic Languages. It is to be noted that Arabic is a member of these languages which share a number of characteristics at the level of phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, and these are the four levels on the basis of which the genetic relationship between the Semitic Languages is founded. The study demonstrates that etymology and comparative philology are indispensable fields of knowledge when it comes to lexicography in general and terminology in particular. They are particularly important in the process of properly defining Arabised concepts and in retaining the accurate meanings of the original terminology. This research concludes that <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> {{the importance}} of these two areas in the fields of lexicography and terminology may lead to serious problems when arabising foreign terminology. The manifestation of this issue could be inadequate formulations in the Arabic language, which may result in the alteration of meanings. Our research concentrates on the term âalmÄniyyah in the Arabic language as used by the Moroccan thinker Taha Abderhman, where the term is analysed into its major constitutive characteristics. Furthermore, its etymology in old languages such as Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and Latin is identified in an attempt to locate the original concepts and the other associated concepts that have been derived from the term almÄniyyah after it has been localised into Arabic. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract–Due to {{the high}} {{integration}} on vertical stacked layers, power/ground network design becomes one of the critical challenges in 3 D IC design. With the leakage-thermal dependency, the increasing on-chip temperature in 3 D designs has serious impact on IR drop due to the increased wire resistance and increased leakage current. Power/ground (P/G) TSVs can help to relieve the IR drop violation by vertically connecting the on-chip P/G networks on different layers. However, most previous work only fulfills a margin of the full potential of PG TSVs planning since the P/G grids are restricted in a uniform topology. Besides, <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> resistance variation and leakage current will make the results less accurate. In this paper, we present an efficient thermal-aware P/G TSVs planning algorithm based on a sensitivity model with temperature-dependent leakage current considered. The proposed method can overcome the limitation of uniform P/G grid topology and make full use of P/G TSVs planning for the optimization of P/G network by allowing short wires to connect the P/G TSVs to P/G grids in non-uniform topology. Moreover, with resistance variation and increased leakage current caused by high temperature in 3 D ICs, more accurate result can be obtained. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of our approach. Results show that neglecting thermal impacts on power delivery can underestimate IR drop by about 11 %. To relieve the severe IR drop violation, 51. 8 % more P/G TSVs are needed than the cases without thermal impacts considered. Results also show that our P/G TSV planning based on the sensitivity model can reduce max IR drop by 42. 3 % and {{reduce the number of}} violated nodes by 82. 4 %. I...|$|E
40|$|Timely {{provision}} of quality products {{at the lowest}} prices possible has become the utmost competitive edge being pursued by virtually all manufacturing firms. They endeavour to speed up their production and deliveries of goods to end customers {{in order to make}} more money and even survive in the fierce competition arena. Although much {{progress has been made in}} operations management and a series of production planning approaches have been proposed to achieve various manufacturing operations goals, optimisation results are often rendered unrealistic and even misleading, for few studies have considered the overall corporate goal of shareholder wealth maximisation and the specific economic environments where manufacturing firms operate. Some critical factors closely related to interests of corporate owners, such as working capital management and capital structure, are rarely involved in an overwhelming majority of production planning problems. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>of</b> the effects of production planning results on the environment makes them more impractical and even unavailable in real-world manufacturing environments. To this end, the dissertation proposes a stochastic production planning model for the uncertain make-to-order production environment, with the focus mainly on the lot sizing decision-making policy. The primary goal of the optimization problem is to maximise the sustainable full interests of corporate owners, namely, the shareholder wealth, rather than to optimise some traditional local or short-term objective functions, such as work flow times, accounting costs, accounting profits and the like. To improve the generality and exactness of the proposed model, all involved uncertain random events are characterized by their own inherent statistical merits without any impractical assumptions on their distributions. The improvement of production planning is not the only one single source of the wealth-based business performance. There are also some other critical factors which can impose direct influences on shareholder wealth. Among these potential shareholder wealth drivers, we choose to examine the effective management of working capital and capital structure, for they are closely pertinent to a firm’s financial position and its cash flow status. In addition, environmental protection has in recent decades aroused extensively global attention because of its far-reaching impingements on the social and economic developments of the world. The carbon emission in production, especially its main component—carbon dioxide, is generally recognized as the most important emission source. To mitigate their diverse interference with the climate and the environment, a wide range of emission reduction measures, laws, and legislations has been enacted and implemented, making production planning optimisations more complicated. To better reflect the emerging production planning environment facing manufacturing firms, the emission trading system for carbon management, which has thus far become the most popular market-based carbon reduction mechanism, is incorporated into the proposed production planning model. To theoretically and analytically validate the proposed approach, the probability and convex theories are adopted to prove the convexity or concavity of the optimisation objectives and the relevant global optimal characteristics. Numerical experiments are further conducted to demonstrate the important implications of the proposed optimisation model to production planning in industrial practices. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
