5|$|In 481BC, a {{congress}} of Greek city-states was held, during which 30 or so states agreed to ally <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> forthcoming invasion. The Spartans and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn {{enemies of the}} Persians.|$|E
5|$|While the Ottomans thus {{temporarily}} therefore {{gained the}} Christian {{regions of the}} disintegrating Safavids, Yesai was blamed for this failure {{by some of the}} leaders of the Armenian army as they were forced to fend for <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Turkish invasions.|$|E
5|$|After decisive Ottoman {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and {{especially}} after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croats continued defending <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the Ottoman attacks.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Karl {{inspected}} Budapest on 19 November at Trieste. Anxious to revenge <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Hungarians, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) planned {{an attack}} on the two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS boats. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest. The torpedoes fired at the Budapest struck the mole of the seaplane station, but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew.|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{became a}} major {{political}} force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. In 1894, the ARF {{took part in the}} Sasun Resistance, supplying arms to the local population to help the people of Sasun defend <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Hamidian purges. In June 1896, the Armenakans organized the Defense of Van in the province of Van, where Ottoman Hamidieh soldiers were to attack the city. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons. They rose to defend the civilians from the attack and subsequent massacre.|$|E

5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of}} his top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which {{included}} a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent {{the spring and}} early summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time in}} the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} superiority of Austrian numbers. From every angle, the Austrians threatened to overwhelm the French. Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared under a cloud of red coats. Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French defenses. By late morning, Charles' troops pushed the French out of Hoßkirch, and into Ostrach, which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements. The fighting remained fierce until about 1600, when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf, encouraged by Austrian cavalry. Once out of Ostrach, and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf, the French formed a new perimeter, reinforced by reserves of Soulham, and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians. Despite the punishing musket fire, Charles' strategy worked. The far right wing (Ferino's force), which had not been attacked yet, fell back to Salem Abbey, to maintain communication with the French center.|$|E

Setting up {{barricades}} and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. Brian is attacked by a zombified Susan, whom Peter shoots before the three {{make it back to}} the boat and leave the island. At sea, Brian dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in a cabin as proof of what has happened on Matul. His reanimated corpse begins banging on the door, as Peter and Anne listen to a radio report that the New York Harbor incident has escalated into an epidemic: as zombies advance on the Brooklyn Bridge, the entire city is under attack.|$|E

Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E

Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E

5|$|The sultan besieged him and {{discovered}} {{him in a}} certain mountain where the Wallachian {{was supported by the}} natural strength of the place. There Vlad had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or {{fall into the hands of}} the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, who had been caught at twilight when they were wandering about imprudently, at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped like lightning in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander (a boyar named Galeş) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain from which he had come. No one dared pursue him, since he had caused such terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And he would have continued to this way, had he not been reprimanded by his friends and brought back, almost against his will.|$|E
