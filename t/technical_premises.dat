The {{goal is to create}} a prototype unit that makes experimental testing and documentation of this principle possible. An electrical linear actuator with a piston was used to manipulate the unit s volume. Depth control was achieved using a PID controller combined with a pressure sensor, and the control parameters tuned by implementing simulations of the unit s dynamical behavior. By combining two power saving methods, it was estimated (using simulations) to reduce the power consumption to 12. 6 % of maximum power consumption. A 3 D model of the unit was made to determine the vertical stability, mass properties, and to create drawings of a prototype. A functional prototype was successfully implemented, and two physical experiments were carried out. The physical experiments were not sufficient to determine the unit s energy efficiency using buoyancy as a principle of vertical movement underwater. But the work here suggest there is a promising potential for the unit being energy efficient...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} the government educational policy document The Curriculum and Standards Framework. I examined the historical and political motivation behind the development of this document and how it introduced a pervasive new initiative of outcomes based education and accountability based on economic rationalism. In particular I examined the implications this new approach had for visual arts education and the subsequent changes to the arts curriculum. This has entailed the introduction of the aesthetic appreciation of the arts as an outcome of the CSF: The Arts. I applied Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s theory of cultural reproduction in education which draws predominantly on a Weberian view and a theory of practice. Bourdieu discusses differential educational achievement according to cultural capital stating education requires certain forms of cultural capital that are not equally distributed among the classes. This therefore impedes or enhances life chances according to social class i. e. educational qualifications become a commodity in the labour market and other social fields. I examined how aesthetic appreciation of the arts has evolved historically as a form of social distinction. This entails an abstract element of arts discourse, which demands a certain linguistic competence, and familiarisation, which Bourdieu claims, is developed in the family, as 2 ̆ 7 cultural capital 2 ̆ 7 this is further perpetuated in schools. The likely outcome is that the introduction of aesthetic appreciation in arts education i. e the demand to 2 ̆ 7 write about 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 talk about 2 ̆ 7 art, will perpetuate class inequality due to social and cultural difference. The study has been to examine the practices of arts education in four schools {{and the extent to which}} aesthetic appreciation was implemented in the visual arts. Data was collected by case study methods of observation, questionnaire and interview and was interpretive in both quantitative and qualitative methods. I analysed the data based on class differentiation by socioeconomic divisions and examined the school ethos and attitude towards the Arts along with differentiation in cultural capital between student population. I also found teacher and student habitus played a vital role in {{the implementation of the}} CSF. This is because habitus can cause resistance to change due to the division between the formulation of the curriculum in the bureaucratic order and the practice of teachers in classrooms. My thesis interprets education as a form of social reproduction, perpetuating the existing social order. However, as Bourdieu asserts and I agree education is a form of symbolic power as it conceals its social function under the guise of neutrality and the <b>technical</b> functional <b>premise.</b> Therefore, this thesis aims to make transparent how the education system serves the interests of the dominant group through curriculum policy. Consequently, it becomes clear how education has far reaching social implications where the distinctions of class are perpetuated through cultural reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Colour {{competence}} {{is often seen}} as a basic knowledge introduced in the early stage of product design education. A knowledge gap was identified that required more advanced learning outcomes for colour in curriculums of product design education at master levels. How can colour knowledge in product design contribute to corporate social responsibility? This was explored through a case study approach. The first case study was a master student’s development of various bottle-green glass lamps {{in collaboration with the}} glass industry. The second case was the development of shades of blue in a ceramic colour surface used in public art in a chapel of rest. The third case was the use of signal yellow colour to demonstrate interface areas in an offshore context in the oil industry. The implementation of all solutions concerned both technical challenges and people’s emotional experiences of what was meaningful in each context. The learning outcomes of the study were an expanded understanding of how colour can be substantial in certain contexts. The first was that knowledge about <b>technical</b> <b>premises</b> in materials was needed to design colour surfaces. The second was that ethnographic competence was needed to analyse possible emotional experiences of colour in various cultures.

This study is of importance as there are no directly related research done on the field of music for mobile phones.

Findings from the analysis of the empirical study points out that human variation of preferences will have great impact of the use of music on mobile phones. We also register a clear trend in our society of convergence between established technologies. At the same time we register the opposite effect of technological divergence, where users demand specialized and dedicated products. These trends does not imply mutual exclusion, but can rather be perceived as supplementing each other.

40|$|The risk {{analysis}} framework {{has been the}} dominant theoretical framework used to address the uncertainty of a potential hazard bypassing the system's safeguards and protection. In essence, this involves {{the evaluation of the}} probability and the magnitude of the consequences of the undesired events that can transform the hazard into actual damage. Despite the <b>technical</b> <b>premises,</b> the importance of integrating social aspects into the analysis is now recognized by an increasing number or {{risk analysis}} models. Another way to deal with potential consequences of hazards is to analyze the vulnerability of the system considered. This paradigm overcomes the shortcomings of risk analysis in situations when the knowledge about the probabilities and the outcomes is incomplete or insufficient On the one hand, studies in the literature show that socio-economic factors are often integrated in a participative way in vulnerability analysis models especially in the natural hazards research field. On the other hand, it seems that such considerations are rarely integrated in the models aiming at evaluating the vulnerability to an industrial hazard. What can we learn from the analysis of models addressing vulnerability to natural hazards in terms of the participatory integration of social factors? What could be the reasons to apply such participation tools in order to assess the vulnerability to industrial hazards? These are the questions we address in this contribution. To do so, we realized a systematic literature review from scientific journal papers on vulnerability analysis published in the last two decades. From this review, three main arguments can be found arguing for the use of participation for vulnerability analysis. Indeed, participation allows (1) context-based assessments, that may (2) foster the development of adaptative capacities (3) both for short and long-term. Based on those arguments, we identifiy possible paths to foster participation for context-based industrial vulnerability analysis. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{assessed}} {{the technical and}} economic premises for installing systems that process manure in order to recover nutrients and inherent energy. The main purpose of recovering nutrients was to extract phosphorus from the manure, {{so as to be}} able to distribute more of the manure on the farm without exceeding the phosphorus regulation. Three other scenarios were included as reference; conventional manure handling, solid-liquid separation only and solid-liquid separation including energy recovery. Since most important parameters for modeling scenarios in agriculture are site-specific (e. g. soil type, crop rotation and manure composition), the thesis results were based on a case farm. The case farm is a 675 ha dairy farm with approx. 1400 milking cows, located in Östergötland, Sweden. As for the results, it was first concluded that the central characteristics of manure were the content of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The higher the DM content, the more fuel for energy recovery, and the higher the N:P-ratio, the more on-farm N can be utilized before having to consider the P regulation. The <b>technical</b> <b>premises</b> for farm-scale nutrient recovery were limited to commercial techniques from companies operating in Sweden, and included various possible processing methods, such as; pH modification, anaerobic digestion, coagulation-flocculation, precipitation, filtration and reverse osmosis. However, most methods were either too costly or simply not realistic to install on stand-alone farms, resulting in only two feasible options; struvite precipitation and secondary solid-liquid separation with a decanter centrifuge. The comparison in economic performance for all scenarios resulted as follows: nutrient recovery by struvite precipitation was the most profitable scenario of all, if struvite was allowed to replace mineral P fertilizer (i. e. end-product on-farm utilization). If not, it was more profitable to invest in only energy recovery, as nutrient recovery by secondary solid-liquid separation or struvite precipitation with end-product sales were not as profitable. However, the absolutely largest increase in profitability lies within investing in a primary solid-liquid separation. As for the case farm, this investment reduced costs by more than 2 MSEK, while any of the latter scenarios reduce costs by 0, 1 - 0, 2 MSEK. Furthermore, the possible utilization of the waste heat from energy recovery increased profitability by a factor of ten...|$|E

The first is {{as a consequence of the}} interest in achieving a unity of concept and volume, at the same time maintaining the architectural tradition of the area. Insofar as the angular shape, this is the response to the idea of obtaining ideal conditions of light in each of the classrooms. &# 13; The building consists of three upper levels, ground floor and semi-basement. In the last of these are found: the gymnasium, the dressing rooms for students and the <b>technical</b> <b>premises</b> serving the school. The ground floor, where the main access is found, includes a small administrative area, the dining room and kitchen, one classroom for girls, three for pre-school children, four for boys and one multifunctional room. The rest of the floors, with the same arrangement, house eight classrooms for girls and five for boys, along with a series of auxiliary premises, such as teachers' rooms, libraries, classrooms for various uses, archives, rooms for crafts, etc.. &# 13; The construction is completed with an ample sports area and recreation zone. Las características formales de este grupo escolar —proyectado en 1969 — vienen determinadas por las grandes cubiertas y la forma dentada de las plantas. La primera de ellas es consecuencia del interés por lograr una unidad de concepto y de volumen, manteniendo, al mismo tiempo, la tradición arquitectónica de la zona. En cuanto a la forma dentada, es la respuesta a la idea de obtener unas óptimas condiciones de iluminación en cada una de las aulas. &# 13; El edificio se compone de tres niveles superiores, planta baja y semisótano.

40|$|Masteroppgave i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologi 1999 - Høgskolen i Agder, GrimstadPurpose and Methods. The {{paper is}} a {{presentation}} of my post graduate thesis at HiA. The focus of this study is Akademiet, a distributed learning system developed by Telenor Kompetanse in Grimstad, Norway. Akademiet is a web application developed for use by Telenor employees and clients who wish to take courses facilitated by the Internet. The increasing dissemination of networked computers, especially via the Internet, enables and accelerates changes in our educational system. Many reforms sought in education are exemplified and realized through this new distributed learning situation. We have gained some insights into what new conditions distributed learning systems impose on the participants. Examples are users ability to work asynchronously, to communicate via the web, participate in collaborative efforts via multi media applications, simulate complex problems by use of computers and networks and the increased flexibility in deciding what, where and when to study. Other aspects of our knowledge are limited. One of the key aims of this effort is to develop an understanding of possibilities and constraints of distributed learning systems in the following domains: • Educational changes with respect to distributed learning situations, especially with regard to technical, organizational and pedagogical issues. • How these changes mediate and effect social interactions and knowledge construction in a complex manner. It is difficult to design good learning environments for use in distributed learning systems. Most current design and course development in this area proceeds primarily on <b>technical</b> <b>premises,</b> with other relevant aspects, such as pedagogical approach and social situation, given only secondary consideration. The main goal of my study is to improve the quality and to increase the efficiency of learning in distributed learning systems, with the focus on Akademiet. My basic argument is that a broader view of design, development, and deployment which takes into account organizational and pedagogical issues as well as technical conditions, with attention to context, is more likely to produce improved learning. In order to make recommendations for improving Akademiet, including how courses should be designed, which applications are appropriate, and how they should be implemented, {{it is important to have}} solid background material to support my views. This background consists of both a sound theoretical perspective derived from a review of educational research literature, and empirical data collected specifically with regard to Akademiet. Primary data was gathered by investigating Akademiet and its surroundings. Secondary data was collected by examining other distributed learning systems, both domestic and foreign, by reviewing other research findings, and by general information gathered through the Internet and literature. Questionnaires were developed and distributed to students at HiA and employees of Telenor; not all of those answering questionnaires had experience with Internet courses. The employees in Telenor who were surveyed did have access to and experience with Akademiet, so results from that research are directly related to Akademiet, whereas other survey data provided a general framework for background considerations. I had several conversations with highly qualified researchers in this area. Various persons in the research staff at Telenor Kompetanse and at Telenor FoU gave me relevant feedback and information for use in this study. I believe that the results from Akademiet, my own research, and these discussions provide a solid background to support my findings and recommendations. Summary of Findings and Recommendations Course development is too often driven by technical constraints and considerations, with pedagogical and organization considerations getting only secondary treatment. The result of inadequate attention to organizational, social and pedagogical issues in the design and development of distributed learning systems is reduced learning effectiveness and marginal benefits to individuals and organizations. Fortunately, this situation can be improved using the available technologies involved in the learning environments. To understand educational changes associated with distributed learning situations, we need to take into account the entire learning situation, including technical aspects as well as organizational and pedagogical aspects, with particular attention to the way that all of these mediate and effect social interaction and knowledge construction. Activity theory, distributed cognition, and other related theoretical perspectives suggest fundamentally new ways to design and form distributed learning environments. The results which are presented in this task are examples of conditions, and not necessarily generally features in educational establishments and organizations. Through the research these conclusions are made: • Through use of ICT the teaching gets more individualized and fluctuating. • Use of visualization increases. • The focus is on student roles. New opportunities to make connections between the students and their interests are possible. • Motivation can increase among students with a positive attitude, where age, education and living situation influences the motivation by the technology. There is not any indication that the gender influences the motivation. • Positive sides with classroom education can be described with; good social settings, and the negative sides with; bad individual needs. In distributed learning environments the respective headwords are; personal needs / adjustments, and; isolation. New technologies introduce new problems with regard to planning and implementing support for learning.

The focus of this study is Akademiet, a distributed learning system developed by Telenor Kompetanse in Grimstad, Norway. Akademiet is a web application developed for use by Telenor employees and clients who wish to take courses facilitated by the Internet. The increasing dissemination of networked computers, especially via the Internet, enables and accelerates changes in our educational system. Many reforms sought in education are exemplified and realized through this new distributed learning situation. We have gained some insights into what new conditions distributed learning systems impose on the participants. Examples are users ability to work asynchronously, to communicate via the web, participate in collaborative efforts via multi media applications, simulate complex problems by use of computers and networks and the increased flexibility in deciding what, where and when to study. Other aspects of our knowledge are limited. One of the key aims of this effort is to develop an understanding of possibilities and constraints of distributed learning systems in the following domains: • Educational changes with respect to distributed learning situations, especially with regard to technical, organizational and pedagogical issues. • How these changes mediate and effect social interactions and knowledge construction in a complex manner. It is difficult to design good learning environments for use in distributed learning systems. Most current design and course development in this area proceeds primarily on <b>technical</b> <b>premises,</b> with other relevant aspects, such as pedagogical approach and social situation, given only secondary consideration. The main goal of my study is to improve the quality and to increase the efficiency of learning in distributed learning systems, with the focus on Akademiet. My basic argument is that a broader view of design, development, and deployment which takes into account organizational and pedagogical issues as well as technical conditions, with attention to context, is more likely to produce improved learning. In order to make recommendations for improving Akademiet, including how courses should be designed, which applications are appropriate, and how they should be implemented, {{it is important to have}} solid background material to support my views. This background consists of both a sound theoretical perspective derived from a review of educational research literature, and empirical data collected specifically with regard to Akademiet. Primary data was gathered by investigating Akademiet and its surroundings. Secondary data was collected by examining other distributed learning systems, both domestic and foreign, by reviewing other research findings, and by general information gathered through the Internet and literature. Questionnaires were developed and distributed to students at HiA and employees of Telenor; not all of those answering questionnaires had experience with Internet courses. The employees in Telenor who were surveyed did have access to and experience with Akademiet, so results from that research are directly related to Akademiet, whereas other survey data provided a general framework for background considerations. I had several conversations with highly qualified researchers in this area. Various persons in the research staff at Telenor Kompetanse and at Telenor FoU gave me relevant feedback and information for use in this study. I believe that the results from Akademiet, my own research, and these discussions provide a solid background to support my findings and recommendations. Summary of Findings and Recommendations Course development is too often driven by technical constraints and considerations, with pedagogical and organization considerations getting only secondary treatment. The result of inadequate attention to organizational, social and pedagogical issues in the design and development of distributed learning systems is reduced learning effectiveness and marginal benefits to individuals and organizations. Fortunately, this situation can be improved using the available technologies involved in the learning environments. To understand educational changes associated with distributed learning situations, we need to take into account the entire learning situation, including technical aspects as well as organizational and pedagogical aspects, with particular attention to the way that all of these mediate and effect social interaction and knowledge construction. Activity theory, distributed cognition, and other related theoretical perspectives suggest fundamentally new ways to design and form distributed learning environments. The results which are presented in this task are examples of conditions, and not necessarily generally features in educational establishments and organizations. Through the research these conclusions are made: • Through use of ICT the teaching gets more individualized and fluctuating. • Use of visualization increases. • The focus is on student roles. New opportunities to make connections between the students and their interests are possible. • Motivation can increase among students with a positive attitude, where age, education and living situation influences the motivation by the technology. There is not any indication that the gender influences the motivation. • Positive sides with classroom education can be described with; good social settings, and the negative sides with; bad individual needs. In distributed learning environments the respective headwords are; personal needs / adjustments, and; isolation. New technologies introduce new problems with regard to planning and implementing support for learning. As has been historically the case, it is not the new media that dictate how and what can be efficiently learned. Rather, it has been the understanding of the possibilities introduced by new media and then the effective integration of those possibilities into sound pedagogical frameworks, which has proven effective in improving learning. All too often, we have failed to effectively integrate new technologies into learning, and much of this failure is a result of continuing to do what was appropriate for older methods and settings...|$|E
40|$|For the {{majority}} of large ungulates living in temperate regions winter is the limiting season, because of the combined effects of lack of resource availability and severity of climatic conditions. Those species that did not develop any particular morphological and physiological adaptation to cope with winter severity may adopt movement and space use tactics instead (like e. g. migration). Specifically, these space use patterns may emerge at different spatiotemporal scales to allow individuals to accede the resources they need and escape unfavourable conditions, thus determining both individual fate and population dynamics. A detailed {{understanding of the relationship}} between limiting factors in wintertime, and individual movement response, is remarkable to preserve and manage wildlife successfully, especially in the context of fast-occurring climate change that induces important alterations in landscape and resource distribution (e. g. changes of snow cover patterns). The comparison of movement tactics under different environmental scenarios, e. g. by means of large -scale analysis at the species distribution range, represents a valuable approach to work in that direction and to assess the effects of landscape alteration on individual movement. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is an excellent model species to investigate these issues, because its distribution range covers most of Europe, thanks to its high ecological plasticity. For those populations that live in northern and mountain environments, winter is the limiting season because roe deer lack any morphological and physiological adaptations to cope with winter severity. In spite of the adoption of specific movement tactics such as partial migration from summer to winter ranges, roe deer may still face limiting conditions in some areas of the distribution range exposed to winter severity. Wildlife managers therefore have developed supplemental feeding programs to sustain roe deer (and other ungulate) populations. Regardless of the pervasiveness of this practice and the potential negative ecological consequences (such as for example the enhanced probability of disease transmission), if and how the interplay between distribution of supplemental feeding sites and winter severity may shape roe deer spatial ecology remains mostly unknown. During my PhD, I provided a contribution to investigate in this direction. First, I relied on the data stored and managed in the EURODEER database (www. eurodeer. org) to evaluate across a wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradient how individuals responded to the presence of these patchily distributed resources under different environmental conditions and supplemental feeding management. The comprehensiveness of large scale datasets such as EURODEER is counterbalanced by some limitations in terms of data resolution of some potentially meaningful environmental variables, such as snow cover. To overcome these limitations, I empirically collected accurate data on snow cover and snow sinking-depth to assess the combined effect of snow and of the distribution of feeding stations on winter resource selection in an Alpine population of roe deer. The investigation of the effect of feeding stations on individual space use tactics should go hand in hand with a proper assessment of the inter-individual relationships occurring at feeding stations, which in turn correspond to contacts btween animals. Measurements of contact rates is a relatively new ecological interest, and could be performed either by visual recording of observers, or by means of proximity loggers or, as alternative, using tr acking data that permit to infer spatial relationships from individual trajectories. The latter two approaches are more practical in terms of application, but both need to be carefully calibrated to avoid biased ecological inference derived from the obtained contact measurements. In this context, I performed a detailed analysis and modelling of the factors influencing the connectivity of recently introduced proximity loggers (WSN, Wireless Sensor Network). In parallel, I explored the potential applicability of SECONDO spatiotemporal database for the investigation of spatial relationships among individuals through the more widespread GPS tracking data. The large-scale comparative analyses I conducted along a wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradient showed that the use of feeding sites by roe deer is highly seasonal, and specifically associated to low temperatures and activation of the feeding stations, but not to snow cover. Moreover, I found some indications that winter use of feeding stations was negatively affected by the presence of competitors. Finally, I found a strong signal of the reduction of individual home range size in relation to feeding site use. Local assessment of roe deer winter resource selection partially supported these results: the main drivers of roe deer resource selection included the proximity to feeding stations (although to a lesser extent than expected) and, a more strong inverse relationship with snow sinkng depth. The main driver of roe deer habitat use was presence of forest canopy. The absence of any statistically significant effect of the index used for measuring snow at a large scale (MODIS) supported the importance of local measurements of snow to complement remotely-sensed data. The finding that the use of feeding stations leads individuals to concentrate their movements around these sites supports the hypothesis of high contact rate between individuals at feeding sites. i. e. as they would work as attractive points. The assessment of encounters is preliminary to the evaluation of such hypothesis. I have demonstrated Wireless Sensor Network proximity loggers as tools with high potentiality for assessment of encounters. At the same time, my work has strongly indicated the need to carefully calibrate these tools before applying them for any biological investigation, and provided practical guidelines on how to proceed, including how to model the error probability. Alternatively, I laid the first <b>technical</b> <b>premises</b> to assess encounters from the more widespread GPS tracking data, by means of high-performance queries within an appropriate spatiotemporal database. I conclude that roe deer use feeding stations, but only when winter conditions are particularly harsh (i. e. low temperature, abundant snow cover). In a context of climate change with an alteration of snow pattern distribution due to a general increase of temperatures, it would be essential to understand whether supplemental feeding management will still be a reasonable and effective tool to manage roe deer. More generally, it would be necessary to assess whether roe deer indeed need feeding stations for overwinter survival. This work clearly provides evidence that the distribution of feeding stations modifies roe deer spatial behaviour. A full understanding of the patterns of animal aggregation, derived from the correct measurement of contact rates, is thus fundamental to understand the consequences of supplemental feeding practices on animal welfare, and ecosystem consequences (e. g., disease transmission). Research in these directions would ultimately permit to understand the tradeoff between benefits and costs, both for wildlife, and as a human action, of supplemental feeding practices, thus helping wildlife managers to take the right decisions...|$|E
