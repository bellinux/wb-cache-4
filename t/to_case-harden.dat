25|$|Carburizing is {{a process}} used <b>to</b> <b>case-harden</b> steel with a carbon content between 0.1 and 0.3 wt% C. In this process steel is {{introduced}} to a carbon rich environment and elevated temperatures for {{a certain amount of}} time, and then quenched so that the carbon is locked in the structure; one of the simpler procedures is repeatedly to heat a part with an acetylene torch set with a fuel-rich flame and quench it in a carbon-rich fluid such as oil.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{compound}} verbs in English poses numerous problems, among which even their recognition as compounds {{on grounds of}} their derivation. Resulting from at least three different word-formation patterns, compound verbs constitute a heterogeneous class of complex lexemes. Their status as actual compound lexemes invites the differentiation between compounding as a word-formation process and compounds as a special class of lexemes. Even within the latter, compound verbs display marked properties at least {{in relation to the}} inability of standard classifications of compounds to capture and compromise their lexical uniformity and their heterogeneous origin. The adoption of a position in which it is argued that compound verbs in English constitute a constructional idiom and the application of scalar analytical notions which combine word-formationist and lexical-semantic accounts cast in the general framework of the cognitive linguistic enterprise yield informative generalizations concerning the linguistic and conceptual properties of compound verbs in English. In view of Radden and Dirven's (2007 : 41 - 46) claim that we do not need "more than two basic types of conceptual units things and relations" in order to establish linguistically relevant conceptual distinctions, compound verbs pose a problem for neat dichotomous treatment as they very often both conceptually and in terms of form include a "thing" (e. g. to flat-hunt, to house-sit, to fellow-feel, <b>to</b> <b>case-harden,</b> etc.) and thus come closer to a "situation" than to a "relation". Exactly {{because of the fact that}} compound verbs profile/perspectivize "situations" as "relations", they function as special construal mechanisms and as such do not fit the subordinate/coordinate distinction, because they name situations. In view of the above the paper treats compound verbs as a constructional idiom whose analysis necessitates the recognition of the role of conceptual conversion mechanisms, scalar classificatory and interpretative criteria and uniform lexico-semantic treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{case-hardened}} crust {{developed on}} the Aztec Sandstone in the Valley of Fire, Nevada, {{has been characterized}} {{by a variety of}} techniques, including electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The case-hardened crust consists mainly of host rock, with a fine-grained cement and wind-deposited kaolinite. The cement is usually calcite, but in some cases the hydrated calcium borate, colemanite, was found <b>to</b> be the <b>case-hardening</b> cement...|$|R
40|$|Micromagnetic nd-techniques like Barkhausen-noise-, {{incremental}} permeability - {{and dynamic}} magnetostriction-inspection {{are well known}} with their capability to characterize microstructures and to measure stress in ferromagnetic materials. Different measuring quantities can be derive during a dynamic magnetization performed by an electromagnet as a yoke-tranducer and controlled by a Hall-element-measurement of the magnetic field strength parallel to the surface under inspection i. e. the tangential field component. Though the driving voltage to excite the field coil of the yoke is sinusoidal the current in the coil and therefore the magnetic field reacts with higher harmonics i. e. a distortion factor can be derived. The contribution describes the technique to analyze these higher harmonics in the tangential field. A complex Fast Fourie Transform {{is used to calculate}} the amplitudes resp. the phases of the higher harmonics, at which only the 3., 5. and 7. are needed. Technical rules can be derived to estimate directly the field strength in theses signals. Together with the distortion factor two indepent inspection quantities are achieved. The contribution represents results where the technique was applied to separate different microstructures of different steels and <b>to</b> measure the <b>case-hardening</b> depth at the surfaces of a martensitic steel...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} between smoking parameters and {{the characteristics of}} salmon raw material were investigated with respect to yield, colour, flesh content of phenol and salt, and sensory properties. The fish studied were ocean ranched salmon harvested in Iceland in July 1998 and farmed salmon from Norway slaughtered in October 1998 and April 1999. Seven treatments were applied on fresh or frozen raw material combining dry or brine salting with cold smoking at 20 or 30 C. Electrostatic smoking was tested on dry-salted salmon fillets. The results show a lower yield after filleting and trimming with ocean ranched fish. Although freezing {{had little effect on}} yield, total loss was slightly greater, especially for fish with low fat content. Sensory differences were also apparent. The brine salting technique resulted in lower losses. Fish with higher fat content gave a better yield after processing, although careful control of the smoking procedure was required (especially at 30 C) <b>to</b> avoid a <b>case-hardening</b> effect. With brine salting, salt uptake was higher for smaller, leaner fish. The phenol content of flesh depended on the technique and/or smoking temperature used, regardless of the fish studied. However, for a smoking temperature of 30 C, the flesh of smaller, leaner fish showed a higher phenol level. Smoking conditions and preliminary treatment such as freezing produced similar differences in sensory characteristics, regardless o...|$|R
