5|$|In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed {{along the}} coastlines of Africa, <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula, and in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, {{giving it the}} second largest nesting {{population}} of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula is a {{peninsula}} {{between the}} Red Sea, <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea, and the Persian Gulf. There are 57known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most {{of the tropical}} cyclones originated in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea, {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57storms have caused at least US$5.7billion in damage and 1,662deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4billion in damage and 50fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. <b>The</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea, which borders <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula.|$|E

50|$|Munnudi {{deals with}} this kind of gender {{discrimination}} - a crime perpetrated by man against woman in the guise of ‘marriage’. The story goes like this. Mutthuchera, a tiny seaside village, has a special attraction to Arabian traders who have been regularly coming to this village. They come in a particular ‘season’ and stay on for about three months during which they settle contracts for buying wood, spices, etc. Local traders vie with each other to woo <b>the</b> <b>Arabians</b> to their side by providing them all comforts including ‘temporary wives’. For this, they have evolved an ingenious method. They induce poor local women to agree to a ‘system’ in which they marry <b>the</b> <b>Arabians</b> and live with them as their wives in nearby posh hotels. After about three months, it is time for <b>the</b> <b>Arabians</b> to go back. They give divorce (Talaaq) before leaving. These women return to their huts and wait in silence for the next ‘season’ to become ‘new wife’ for some ‘new’ Arabian husband.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arabian</b> {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. <b>The</b> <b>Arabian</b> also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} theories {{about where the}} ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> originally lived. Most evidence suggests the proto-Arabian came from the area along {{the northern edge of}} the Fertile Crescent. Another hypothesis suggests the southwestern corner of <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> peninsula, in modern-day Yemen, where three now-dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago, perhaps {{as far back as the}} Ice Age. This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between 6590 and 7250 BCE in Al-Magar, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, that appeared to portray horses.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression the next day. The system developed further into a cyclonic storm on May 29 as it moved to the north. The storm reached its peak with 95km/h (60mph) soon after this as it turned to the west, but soon degenerated into a deep depression over the northern Arabian Sea on May 31. The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia the next day.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> horse, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe cyclonic storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic storm on record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E

But, during the Joseon Dynasty, Confucianism was adopted {{as the national}} philosophy, and, in process of eliminating certain Buddhist beliefs, Goryeo Cheongja porcelains were replaced by white Baekja, which lost favour of the Chinese and <b>the</b> <b>Arabians.</b> Also, commerce became more restricted during this {{time in order to}} promote agriculture.
