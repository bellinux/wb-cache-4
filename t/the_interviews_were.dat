A separate section of the report rejected allegations by Hoboken's Mayor Dawn Zimmer that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had linked release of Hurricane Sandy relief funds to approval of a project represented by David Samson's law firm.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, Dalton {{was hired}} at Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas as a string {{instructor}} and {{conductor of the}} college orchestra. After a year at Southwestern {{he was invited to}} join the faculty at Brigham Young University in the fall of 1963. He spent three years at Brigham Young University teaching viola and violin and was also instrumental in developing the university’s chamber music program. In 1967 Dalton took a three-year leave of absence from BYU to complete a doctoral degree in viola performance at Indiana University (IU). Dalton attended IU for three years, studying under his former mentor from Eastman—William Primrose. He wrote his dissertation on viola repertoire in 1970, including an interview with William Primrose and Tibor Serly, and the latter's involvement in preparing Bartók's manuscript for his viola concerto. <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> published in Music and Letters in 1976. After he received his doctorate in 1970, he returned to Brigham Young University. While teaching there, he helped form a faculty quartet called the Deseret String Quartet.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 4 Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki grappled and berthed the Multi-purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM was berthed to {{the station}} at 04:24 UTC (00:24 EDT). The hatches were opened by station flight {{engineer}} Soichi Noguchi and shuttle mission specialist Clayton Anderson at 11:58 UTC (07:58 EDT). The joint STS-131/Expedition 23 crews began transferring cargo from the MPLM, with the first item being a Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) which will be replaced on the first spacewalk of the mission. During flight day 4 commander Alan Poindexter did several in-flight interviews. Commander Poindexter was joined by mission specialists Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson. <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> with the Tom Joyner Radio Show, WVIT-TV and Fox News Radio. At {{the end of the}} day Mastracchio and Anderson entered the Quest airlock and begin breathing pure oxygen for an hour, while the atmospheric pressure inside the airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi. This procedure is known as the pre-breathe protocol and is done before every spacewalk, to purge nitrogen from the blood stream and prevent decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|On Flight Day 4, Stott and Barratt grappled the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) {{using the}} Canadarm2 and removed {{it from the}} {{starboard}} sill of Discovery's payload bay. Once it was grappled {{and out of the}} payload bay, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System grappled the end of the OBSS and took a hand off from the Canadarm2. The OBSS was grappled by the space station arm, because the SRMS could not reach it due to clearance issues, and it needed to be moved out of the way so that the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) could be removed from the payload bay. After the OBSS hand off, the entire STS-133 crew was joined by ISS Expedition 26 commander Scott Kelly and flight engineer Paolo Nespoli for a series of in-flight media interviews. <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted with the Weather Channel, WBZ radio in Boston, Massachusetts, WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, and WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. The crew also completed more cargo transfers to and from the ISS. Throughout the day, Drew and Bowen prepared tools that they would use on their spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Later in the day, they were joined by the shuttle crew and ISS commander Kelly and Flight Engineer Nespoli, for a review of the spacewalk procedures. After the review, Bowen and Drew donned oxygen masks and entered the crew lock of the Quest airlock for the standard pre-spacewalk campout. The airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi for the night. This was done to help the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from their blood and help prevent decompression sickness, also known as the bends.|$|E

Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon.

Fox spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, [...] "I'd have to catch him like a salmon." [...] <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted seated at a table, but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a lapel microphone.
