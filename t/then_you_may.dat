Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (<b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E
