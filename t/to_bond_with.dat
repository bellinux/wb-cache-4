5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E

In benzene, where the delocalized molecular orbitals contain 6 pi electrons over six carbons essentially yielding half a pi <b>bond</b> together <b>with</b> the sigma <b>bond</b> for each pair of carbon atoms, giving a calculated bond order of 1.5. Furthermore, bond orders of 1.1, for example, can arise under complex scenarios and essentially refer <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> strength relative <b>to</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> order 1.|$|R
5|$|The {{element is}} {{normally}} found {{in association with}} other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), {{former head}} of Project Alice {{and the head of}} the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.|$|E

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>bonding</b> {{the surface}} is covered with {{hydrogen}} and fluorine atoms. The bonding at room temperature is mostly based on van-der-Waals forces between those hydrogen and fluorine atoms. Compared <b>to</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> hydrophilic surfaces, the interface energy is lower directly after contacting. This fact builds up {{the need for a}} higher surface quality and cleanliness to prevent unbonded areas and thereby to achieve a full-surface contact between the wafers (compare infrared photograph of a <b>bond</b> wave). Similar <b>to</b> <b>bonding</b> of hydrophilic surfaces, the pre-bond is followed by an annealing process.|$|R
5|$|Though {{at first}} Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his {{attempts}} to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is {{not the cause of}} his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> Iblis, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat Solaris.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E

5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} Linden begin a relationship. Faye {{discovers that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joseph's baby, but Linden promises to support her and they become briefly engaged. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|Glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) sets up his widower father Burt (Mike O'Malley) with Finn Hudson's (Cory Monteith) widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont). He {{believes}} that it will help him become closer to Finn, for whom he has feelings. Finn is upset when Carole sells their old furniture, and stops his late father's recliner from being sold. He is initially hostile to her dating someone new, but begins <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> Burt over sports at a group dinner. Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but relents after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. They watch a basketball game together and Finn allows Burt to sit in his father's recliner, while Kurt watches on sadly through the window.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{had been}} uninvolved in the {{upbringing}} {{of all his}} children. This provided producers with scope to introduce estranged family members. In 2006, writers devised a long-running storyline in-which Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) plans a revenge campaign against his father. Robert's motives for his vendetta stem from Paul not being around while he grew up. Paul was happy that he had triplet children Elle, Robert and Cameron Robinson (also played by Hunter) back in his life. He tries to make amends with Robert and attempts <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> him unaware that he is being plotted against. Writers decided to mark the show's 5000th episode with the story and Robert takes Paul hostage down a mineshaft. Dennis filmed the scenes in a filthy studio set surrounded by cameras, lighting and crew. He told Herbison (Inside Soap) that he {{found it difficult to}} pretend he was trapped underground.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|Ste becomes {{friends with}} Natty, Daniel and Abi and begins a {{short-lived}} relationship with Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), which he ends {{to focus on}} getting Amy back. Amy gives birth to her and Ste's son Lucas Hay, helped by Ste, Daniel and Abi. Amy, however, suffers from post-natal depression, and leaves {{to live with her}} grandmother, leaving Lucas and Leah with Mike, who later leaves them in Ste's care. Abi and Daniel begin to help Ste with looking after Lucas, with plans of taking Lucas to replace their own son who died. Abi starts drugging Ste as Daniel turns him against Natty, who grows suspicious of Daniel and Abi's interests. Mike finds Ste asleep whilst looking after Lucas, so takes him. However, Ste takes Lucas back and stops Mike from seeing him. Ste almost shakes Lucas, so Daniel convinces him to give his son up. The truth is revealed, Daniel is arrested and later released, he and Abi leave the village. Amy returns and slowly begins <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> her children again. They move into their old flat together.|$|E

Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> Walter by teaching him to play the flute.

5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing {{conditions of the}} early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.|$|E
