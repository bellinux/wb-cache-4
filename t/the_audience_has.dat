5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> yet to see them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> noticed nothing unusual ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{films of}} Yasujirō Ozu {{are well known}} for their unusual {{approach}} to film narrative. Scenes that most filmmakers would consider obligatory (e.g., the wedding of Noriko) are often not shown at all, while apparently extraneous incidents (e.g., the concert attended by Hattori but not Noriko) are given seemingly inordinate prominence. Sometimes important narrative information is withheld not only from a major character, but from the viewer, such as the news of Hattori’s engagement, about which neither Noriko’s father nor <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> any knowledge until Noriko, laughing, informs him. And at times, the filmmaker proceeds, within a scene, to jump from one time frame to another without transition, as when two establishing shots of some travelers waiting for a train on a platform lead to a third shot of the same train already {{on its way to}} Tokyo.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Avatar {{began in}} [...] in Los Angeles and Wellington, New Zealand.

[...] "Ideally {{at the end of}} the day <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> no idea which they're looking at," [...] Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film. The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace. In , Fox had announced that 3-D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable. According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.|$|E

500|$|Bird {{combined}} {{his knowledge}} from {{his years in}} television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons {{as an example of}} working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. [...] "There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> the remote and they're going to change channels," [...] he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton {{played an important role in}} shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the [...] "hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening." [...] Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the [...] "Duck and Cover sequence" [...] came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film. Nicknamed [...] "The X-Factor" [...] by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{reported}} in July 2009 that Lionsgate greenlit Saw VII and announced David Hackl {{would return to}} direct, his last film being Saw V. Producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules, and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan also returned. Brian Gedge replaced series' cinematographer David Armstrong. [...] Pre-production began on September 14, 2009. According to Melton, there were plans to title the film Saw: Endgame. Originally two sequels were planned after the sixth, but in December 2009 Melton stated in a podcast interview with the UK radio station Demon FM that Saw VII was the final installment and would address unanswered questions from previous Saw films, such as {{the fate of the}} first film's protagonist Dr. Lawrence Gordon and other Jigsaw survivors from previous films, while bringing a final resolution to the series. The storyline for a Saw VIII was combined into Saw VII; this decision was primarily due to Saw VI below average box office performance. [...] On July22, 2010 in an interview with USA Today the producers confirmed that Saw VII will officially end the film series. Burg told Reuters that, [...] "In every Saw movie, we left questions open and in Saw VII we answer every question <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> ever had". He added that, [...] "even new viewers will be able to follow and get caught up to speed".|$|E

500|$|The film's {{tone and}} {{narrative}} style received mixed {{response from the}} critics. Ronnie Scheib at Variety {{found it to be}} filled with excessive pathos, [...] "shuttling between the trite and the sublime", while Odile Tremblay (Le Monde) said in contrary that the film avoided excessive pathos, rendering it funny and tragic at the same time, an observation that was supported by Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir, who wrote that the film mixes humour, sensitivity and drama. Hammer to Nails review by Michael Nordine asserted that the film is [...] "neither a pity party nor an emotionally manipulative attempt", but a straightforward portrayal of things as they were, citing Gatlif's portrayal of the Romani as [...] "certainly sympathetic, but at no point does it seem overly so." [...] The film provided insufficient analysis on the [...] "anti-roaming laws" [...] and their targeting of the Romani, observed [...] the reviewer, to whom the Nazi and all other anti-Romani characters in the film came across as [...] "one dimensional bigots". Bob Hill (Moving Pictures Network) criticised that the film failed to strike an emotional chord, unlike other movies and books with a similar theme. He conceded it to be an [...] "important, but not a great movie—or even a particularly good one, for that matter." [...] For a casual movie goer, he stated, [...] "Korkoro feels like a slow burn, lagging on long after most of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> long since called it quits". In defence of the film's incoherent narrative style, Jr Glenn Heath at Slant Magazine explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory, imbibing the stream of consciousness techniques. Commenting on its tone, he wrote that [...] "Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror". At L'Express, Sophie Benamon declared that with the film's controlled pace, it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche stated that the film transcends the stereotypes while the reviewer at Arizona Reporter noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romani.|$|E
500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E

50|$|De Roche later {{expressed}} some {{dissatisfaction with}} the film:Unfortunately, the bush {{comes across as a}} threat too early; it should have emerged as a threat only after <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>had</b> sympathized with <b>the</b> animals. And I don’t think that sympathy is there. Long Weekend would have been much better if <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>had</b> been told at the beginning that Peter and Marcia were going to die. This way, it wouldn’t have had to sympathize with them, and could have concerned itself solely with when this was going to happen. Such is the essence of suspense.|$|R

2500|$|The Stephanie Miller Show premiered on September 7, 2004. In {{launching}} the show, Miller said, [...] "As talk radio has {{more and more}} become a sea of right-wing wackos, I think <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> finally {{recognized the need to}} balance that with some good left-wing wackos, and I'm thrilled to be able to fill that need." [...] When the show began in 2004, the on-air personalities were Stephanie Miller as host, “Voice Deity” Jim Ward as co-host, and “Boy Toy” Chris Lavoie as Executive Producer, the same team that worked with Miller on her previous radio show from 1997-2000. The show was originally dubbed Operation Take Back America, and primarily consisted of Miller and Ward, with Lavoie interjecting periodically. Lavoie’s on-air presence expanded over the years. Associate Producer Rebekah Taylor (nee Baker), who screened phone callers, would also occasionally be heard on air.|$|E
2500|$|The {{course of}} act 2 is {{determined}} {{in part by}} the audience, who vote to decide things such as whether Henri should take Greta or Maggy to the fair, and whether Henri should escape the Theatre Director by taking a cruise or else stay to work on his opera. In the central fairground scene (more extended than the one in the first act), there is a puppet show with four different versions of the Faust story, each with its own particular musical colouration. Throughout this scene, the audience is repeatedly called upon to decide whether to continue with the current version, or change to one of the other. In three of the four possible endings, Henri never even begins to compose his own Faust opera [...] The work closes with a general finale which presents a critical interpretation of the events that took place during whichever version <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>has</b> witnessed, and in which it has participated [...]|$|E
