This study was performed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS women in Ahvaz. Subjects and Methods: In an epidemiologic descriptive study, a total number of 53 women who attended the endocrinology clinic in Ahvaz from 2007 through 2008, and were diagnosed as PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, {{were enrolled in the}} study. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was studied {{on the basis of the}} criteria explained by American National Cholesterol Panel (ATP-III criteria) Result: Fifty three women with the mean age of 24 ± 6. 8 years were studied in this research. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women of Ahvaz was estimated to be as 13. 5 %, and the prevalence for individual components comprising the metabolic syndrome were: fasting glucose blood concentrations greater <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 110 mg/dl in 4 patient (7. 7 %), hypertension in 4 patients (7. 7 %), waist circumference greater <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 88 cm in 14 patients (34. 1 %), HDL less than 40 mg/dl in 12 patients (24 %), triglyceride greater <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 150 mg/dl in 5 patients (9. 4 %), IFG in 17 patients (32. 7 %), diabetes in 3 patients (5. 8 %) and dislipidemia in 31 patients (60 %).

40|$|A theory {{explaining}} the high aspect ratios for cloud level convection in the Venusian atmosphere is presented.

For vertical diffusivity greater <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 100, 000 sq cm/s, radiative transfer contributes to the flattening.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} hedging a stock portfolio with stock index futures. Instead of defining the hedge ratio as the minimum variance hedge ratio, we consider several measures of downside risk: the semivariance according to Markowitz [19591 {{and the various}} lower partial moments according to Fishburn's [1977] alpha-t model (alpha>O). Analytically we show that for normal returns and biased futures markets there is an extra cost associated with hedging lower partial moments if the minimum variance hedge ratio instead of the optimal hedge ratio is used. We prove that the extra cost is different from zero if a is bigger <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> 1. Furthermore, in case futures markets are positively biased minimum lower partial moment hedge ratios are smaller than the minimum variance hedge ratio (strictly smaller in case a is bigger <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> 1). We used the Dutch FTI contract to hedge three Dutch stock market indexes. The in-sample analysis shows that (i) minimum semivariance and minimum variance hedge ratios are almost the same in size, (ii) minimum lower partial moment hedge ratios are smaller than minimum variance hedge ratios (only slightly smaller for a is bigger <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> 1) and (iii) except for the lower partial moment with a= 0. 5, hedging downside risk using the minimum variance hedge ratio instead of the optimal hedge ratio is appropriate. For both strategies risk can be reduced in the same proportion whereas the extra cost of using the minimum variance hedge strategy is negligible. In contrast to (iii), out-of-sample {{results show that the}} extra cost of hedging lower partial moments with the minimum variance hedge strategy can be significant (statistically as well as indownside risk; hedging; futures...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} boron/beryllium {{ratio in}} extreme Population II stars {{has been interpreted}} as evidence of Be and B synthesis by early Galactic cosmic rays. However, a recent reanalysis of the boron abundance in the Population II halo star HD 140823 suggests that B/H may be larger than previously reported, {{by as much as}} a factor of 4. This would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range 14 less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to B/Be less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 50. The possibilty of a high Population II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the upper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic-ray production. It is found that the limit to cosmic-ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. For any Population II cosmic-ray spectrum that is a single power law in either total energy per nucleon or in momentum, the B/Be ratio constrained to lie in the range 7. 6 less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to B/Be less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 14. Thus, if the new B/Be ratio is correct, it requires either a bimodal cosmic-ray flux with a large low-energy component, or, for another B source, possibly the proposed nu-process in supernovae, either of which may be helpful in explaining the observed B- 11 /B- 10 ratio. Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights the uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional data on Be and B abundances...|$|R
