5|$|On 8–9 July 1960, the {{soldiers}} were invited to appoint black officers, and 'command of the army passed securely {{into the hands of}} former sergeants,' as <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked Congolese army soldiers as their new officers. Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new Congolese hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at Leopoldville and Thysville. The Force Publique was renamed the Armée nationale congolaise (ANC), or Congolese National Armed Forces. However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.|$|E

5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion.

Gunfire was directed at all of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park.

5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E

Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program {{for less than a}} year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} briefly {{saved by the}} war against the Seminoles in Florida which {{provided}} the first sale of Colt's revolvers and his new revolving rifles. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns. Consequently, many curious soldiers took the locks apart. This resulted in breakage of parts, stripped screw heads and inoperable guns. Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued. In late 1843, after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company's most liquid assets.|$|E
5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since {{it was always the}} last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{returning}} Chinook, {{carrying the}} remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> Matthews' helicopter exited and joined {{the first half of the}} company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.|$|E

5|$|The {{trials for}} the Columbia County {{residents}} held at Fort Mifflin {{were held in}} October and November 1864. At least three of those tried admitted to having been at a secret meeting on August 14, that many people were armed at the meeting, and that {{the people at the}} meeting intended to resist <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> Bloomsburg. However, most of the prisoners were released on or before January 1865, although a few were held until May 1865. No one was charged for the murder of Lieutenant Robinson until 1891, when Elias Young was arrested and charged. Although Young admitted to firing a gun, he stated that two people in the party searching for deserters had fired first. The court ruled that Young was acting in self-defense, and he was declared not guilty.|$|E
5|$|While many {{soldiers}} were still arriving, {{the citizens of}} Benton held a meeting on August 14 {{to decide whether or}} not they would resist the soldiers. Many argued against it, but approximately 75 men declared they were prepared to resist any military occupation of their part of Columbia County. These men were led by Jacob Schultz, Samuel Kline, and one person from Orangeville. Kline went south to the town to learn more about <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> Bloomsburg. According to an account by Edward McHenry, the other members of the resistance were told to remain at home until news arrived from Bloomsburg. When the draft evaders discovered that the army coming from Bloomsburg was too strong to defeat, McHenry and 20 other draft evaders in the county escaped to North Mountain.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Kumusi, the 16th Brigade {{was ordered to}} move towards Sanananda Point to support the joint Australian–US effort to attack the Japanese beachheads around the Buna–Gona area. The ration situation had grown worse by this time, and progress was slow as the march proved too difficult for many of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> their weakened physical states. Nevertheless, by 18 November, the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion had led the brigade into Popondetta, after which the 2/3rd moved into the vanguard. For {{the next two days}} they experienced almost no opposition until 21 November when Japanese artillery began to target the 2/1st. Launching a quick attack with three companies, the 2/1st outflanked the Japanese gun pit with two companies while the third provided support-by-fire. In the rout that followed over 80 Japanese were killed. By nightfall, the 2/1st, which had dug-in and subsequently fought off a number of Japanese counterattacks, was relieved from the forward position just a few kilometres from the coast. The brigade had been severely depleted in reaching the position and at that point had only 1,040 fit men, so they were ordered to hold their position along the front to provide cover to troops of the US 126th Infantry Regiment, which was slowly moving towards the Soputa–Sanananda–Cape Killerton track junction. On 23 November, the 16th Brigade finally received artillery support, after a battery from the 2/1st Field Regiment was flown into the hastily established airfield at Popondetta and began firing upon Sananada. The inexperienced American regiment made very slow progress and as a result, the 16th Brigade held their position until 6 December, when they were progressively relieved by troops from the 30th Brigade, having suffered over 85 per cent casualties. The 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was the last out, being withdrawn on the night of 19/20 December.|$|E
