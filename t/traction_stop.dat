2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball, or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved <b>traction.</b> <b>Stopping</b> power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less unsprung weight. Power assist was available with both brake packages. Evolutionary engineering changes included positive crankcase ventilation, a smaller flywheel, and an aluminum clutch housing. A more efficient alternator replaced the old-fashioned generator.|$|R
50|$|The paw is characterised by thin, pigmented, keratinised, hairless {{epidermis}} covering subcutaneous collagenous and adipose tissue, {{which make}} up the pads. These pads act as a cushion for the load-bearing limbs of the animal. The paw consists of the large, heart-shaped metacarpal or palmar pad (forelimb) or metatarsal or plantar pad (rear limb), and generally four load-bearing digital pads, although there can be five or six toes {{in the case of}} domestic cats and bears (including giant panda). A carpal pad is also found on the forelimb which is used for additional <b>traction</b> when <b>stopping</b> or descending a slope in digitigrade species. Additional dewclaws can also be present.|$|R
50|$|Five bids were considered, but the {{contract}} was awarded to the Manufacture d'Orgues Thomas of Sert-Francorchamps. The Thomas organ is faithful to the North German baroque tradition in its mechanical <b>traction,</b> in what <b>stops</b> it has and in the materials of its pipes. But it {{has a number of}} modern features. The most noticeable of these is the decidedly contemporary look of its organ case, asymmetrical and decorated with horizontal resin strips whose LEDs can emit light of different colors. Of greater importance for the organist is that the range of its three manuals (C-G) and its pedal (C-F') is wider than the organ’s models, that its tuning is modern (A = 440 Hz) so that the organ can easily be used in ensembles, and that its stops and their combinations are selected electronically.|$|R
50|$|The device {{consists}} of a flexible plastic tube containing several internal channels and two inflatable balloons. Apart from the balloons, the tube has an opening at the bottom (gastric tip) of the device. More modern models also have an opening near the upper esophagus; such devices are properly termed Minnesota tubes. The tube is passed down into the esophagus and the gastric balloon is inflated inside the stomach. A traction of 1 kg {{is applied to the}} tube so that the gastric balloon will compress the gastroesophageal junction and reduce the blood flow to esophageal varices. If the use of <b>traction</b> alone cannot <b>stop</b> the bleeding, the esophageal balloon is also inflated to help stop the bleeding. The esophageal balloon should not remain inflated for more than six hours, to avoid necrosis. The gastric lumen is used to aspirate stomach contents.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the most utilized rotation and traction related movements among international futsal players when they are in a ball possession situation. A total of 4 matches from The AFF Futsal Championship 2014 were analyzed. The analyzed matches consist of two semifinal matches, 3 rd- 4 th placing match and the final match. There are four indicators for rotation movement (half-trunk rotation, half-body rotation, quick-half trunk rotation, and quick-body rotation) and four indicators for traction movement (front traction, back traction, side <b>traction,</b> and sudden <b>stop)</b> that are selected to be observed in this study. Each indicator was divided into two categories, which are attacking and defensive mode. All matches were recorded using a full high definition video camera and analyzed using SportCode Elite (v. 10) and Dartfish EasyTag (v. 1. 0. 8) software. Two trained and experienced analysts were assigned to analyze all 4 matches. Inter- and Intra- analyst reliability studies were also performed in order to examine the content validity of the data obtained. Overall results indicated that the front traction during the defensive mode is the most utilized movement, among others, while back traction during the attacking mode is the least utilized movement. Front traction during attacking mode was found to be the highest number of usage during attacking mode while sudden <b>stop</b> <b>traction</b> during defensive mode is the least utilized movement among other defensive movements. Regardless of attacking or defensive mode, results show that front traction is the most utilized movement, followed by half-trunk rotation and side traction. This study also show that the rotation (47 %) and traction movements (53 %) utilized during competitive games are quite balanced. A similar result was also obtained when comparing between attacking (46 %) and defensive mode distribution (54 %) from overall data. Further study on futsal games should focus on the most utilized movement during competitive matches to understand more about the nature of the games...|$|R
40|$|Methods. 17 physicians, {{experienced}} in transvenous lead removal, performed a lead extraction manoeuvre of an ICD lead on a torso phantom. They were advised to <b>stop</b> <b>traction</b> only when further traction {{would be considered}} as harmful to the patient or when—based on their experience—a change in the extraction strategy was indicated. Traction forces were recorded with a digital precision gauge. Results. Median traction forces on the endocardium were 10. 9 [*]N (range from 3. 0 [*]N to 24. 7 [*]N and interquartile range from 7. 9 to 15. 3). Forces applied to the proximal end were estimated to be 10 % higher than those measured {{at the tip of}} the lead due to a friction loss. Conclusion. A traction force of around 11 [*]N is typically exerted during standard transvenous extraction of ICD leads. A traction threshold for a safe procedure derived from a pool of experienced extractionists may be helpful for the development of required adequate simulator trainings...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hyperechoic microfoci are {{sometimes}} visualized in normal joints. We hypothesized that these microfoci may correspond to gas microbubbles {{produced by a}} vacuum phenomenon. The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the possibility of generating intraarticular hyperechoic microbubbles by creating a vacuum phenomenon through traction on a metacarpophalangeal joint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied manual traction to the second metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of 22 volunteer subjects to separate articular surfaces {{with the aim of}} producing a vacuum. For one subject, the production of a vacuum was verified on a radiograph performed during the traction maneuver. For all subjects, ultrasonographic examination of the MCP joints was performed before, during, and after traction maneuvers. Two radiologists evaluated the presence of intraarticular hyperechoic microfoci and measured the widening of the joint space during traction. RESULTS: In the first subject, the widening of the joint space and the production of an intraarticular gas-like cavity by traction was confirmed on the radiograph. In 10 out of the 22 volunteers, the widening of the joint space was immediately followed by the appearance of a large intraarticular hyperechoic band, which disappeared when the <b>traction</b> was <b>stopped,</b> followed by the appearance of hyperechoic microfoci that persisted several minutes. The widening of the joint during the traction maneuver was greater in the group where hyperechoic foci were produced than in the group with no hyperechoic foci (mean 2. 5 vs. 1. 2 mm and 2. 2 vs. 0. 8 mm, respectively, for observers 1 and 2; P[*]<[*] 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: Intraarticular hyperechoic microfoci may be produced and persist in normal joints after a traction maneuver. They are presumed to correspond to microbubbles created by a transient vacuum phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|With current {{automotive}} {{trends in}} both vehicle electrification and intelligent {{features such as}} Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), {{there is a significant}} need for a modern vehicle development process which makes use of big data. In the following report, a scalable, phone-based, driving data collection system is developed and applied to powertrain design through a motivating example. Initial project efforts are directed towards the development of both a data collection platform and a system which is capable of interpreting and storing the collected drive data. The developed UWAFT Innovation Platform (UIP) and Monocular Vision Pipeline (MVP) are a functional system which attempt to precipitate crowdsourcing of data collection through a low system cost and open software approach. In an application of this platform data is collected by a test driver for a month {{in the form of a}} pilot project, with results evaluated in terms of geographical coverage and with the development of a statistical event profile detailing events of simulation value. The data collected contains over 6 million data points, and over 7. 45 hrs of driving. In evaluating MVP performance, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) multi-object detector and Markov Decision Process (MDP) multi-object tracker are implemented, with results demonstrating robustness to occlusions and the capability to detect far-away pedestrians and vehicles. With this data collection system functional, and the data from the pilot project experiment, a powertrain simulation environment for University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team (UWAFT) is developed. Given the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) process, it is crucial to continue to explore and design novel powertrain configurations in an environment which is conducive to flexible configuration and with acceptable ease-of-use. Of the environments available, Simscape is selected and a novel Metal-Air Extended Range Electric Vehicle (MA-EREV) powertrain model is developed as a validation of the simulation tool. Upon validating simulated VTS against existing work, results are consistent excluding a 15 % reduction in estimated range and a 41 % decrease in 50 - 70 mph acceleration time. To provide an example of the data-driven approach, a winter-driving scenario where the pilot project driver demonstrated slipping is imported as a drive cycle in the MA-EREV model and simulated in an experiment. In analyzing results traction performance of the MA-EREV is evaluated. The MA-EREV weighs 677 kg more than the pilot project vehicle, and has increased starting torque due to electrification. In analyzing the results of this scenario replication, the longitudinal slip on the tires reached a maximum of 41 % slip (94 % of available <b>traction)</b> during <b>stopping</b> and 84 % slip (55 % of available traction) during acceleration from stop, with more slipping overall during acceleration than stopping. This result indicates that the MA-EREV may need additional traction considerations for safe performance in winter conditions...|$|R
