5|$|A {{transport}} fleet {{protected by}} warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all. Equipment, victuals, munitions and 1,300 horses had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> over, {{as well as}} arms, munitions and money for the Greek provisional government of John Capodistria. France wished to support free Greece as it came into being by helping it activate its army, {{with the aim of}} gaining influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{supply was}} entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court.

5|$|With the {{weakening}} of Byzantium, Venice began to see Ragusa as a rival who needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed.

5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E

5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|Back {{home she}} resumes {{her job as}} a {{physiotherapist}} in Soweto. Then in June 1976 Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in Afrikaans. They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and African National Congress (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Cornfoot's {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by members of}} the aristocracy appointed by the Privy Council two weeks after the killing. Subsequently four men were held in custody and charges were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> against the burgh bailie. The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick Cowper, the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the Privy Council that another committee should look into the events, no suspects were ever prosecuted for the murder.|$|E

A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
