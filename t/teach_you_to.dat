The action {{was supposed to be}} concerned with the prisoners in the Bolotnaya Square case, corrupt Olympic officials, the plight of the arrested environmentalist [...] and suppressed freedoms in Russia. On February 18, 2014, they were detained in Sochi together with a group of 12-15 people including Yevgeny Feldman, a Novaya Gazeta journalist. The authorities explained that the arrest was in connection with a theft at a hotel in Sochi. In a few hours they were released from an Adler police station. According to BBC correspondent Rafael Saakov the five women left the police station in balaclavas singing their song [...] "Putin Will <b>Teach</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Love the Motherland" [...] on the streets of Adler.|$|E

An attorney for the band members stated they were treated at a hospital for injuries received during the attack.|$|E

2500|$|In another article, Fitzpatrick told of {{his work}} with a student who had been [...] "horribly crippled" [...] from birth. [...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I will <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day I taught him. [...] I showed him how to step and helped him with my hands to take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E
