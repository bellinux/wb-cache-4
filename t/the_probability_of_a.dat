5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. <b>The</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. <b>The</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E

This species {{is now one of the}} most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E

For the first time since its inception, subordination of the counter-air role to the ground support mission ended, and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|Gray and {{his team}} at CSU issued their initial season outlook on December4, 1998, {{predicting}} fourteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The three main factors for this above average season forecast cited included a continuation of abnormally warm sea surface temperatures, the probability that La Niña conditions would remain, and that the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) winds {{would be in a}} westerly phase. Early in 1999, WRC issued its forecast for the season, projecting ten named storms and six hurricanes, but no prediction on the number of major hurricanes. In subsequent outlooks from Gray and his associates in April, June, and August, the predictions were unchanged. On April7, CSU noted that <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane landfall in the United States was 72%, including a 54% chance on the East Coast and a 40% likelihood on the Gulf Coast. In their outlook on May27, experts at NOAA noted that an above average season was a strong possibility. An addition to a La Niña, vertical wind shear would be decreased across much of the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic Ocean, and a favorable jet pattern for tropical waves to develop into tropical cyclones. On June1, TSR predicted that there would be 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 2major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest {{at a distance of}} about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

30|$|Cornwell et al. (2008), {{using data}} from the University of Georgia, find that HOPE led to <b>an</b> {{increase}} in <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> initial education major.

To explore this a bit further, we redid our analysis using just data for the University of Georgia and find that HOPE had no effect on <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earned major in education. When we consider the initial education major for University of Georgia students, we obtain a positive, but statistically insignificant, coefficient on HOPE that is similar in magnitude to that found by Cornwell et al.

Thus, {{there may have been a}} slight positive effect of HOPE on initial education majors for students at the University of Georgia, but there appears to be no effect of HOPE on education degrees conferred.|$|R
5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts {{tend to be}} bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting {{in the mid to}} late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting <b>the</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E
