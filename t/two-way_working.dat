5000|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the main}} streets of Shoreditch (Old Street, Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road, Great Eastern Street) were formed into a mile-long one-way system, which became {{associated}} with traffic congestion, poor conditions for walking and cycling, high speeds, high collision rates, and delays for bus services. The gyratory system {{came to be}} seen as [...] "the main factor holding back the cultural regeneration of South Shoreditch" [...] and [...] "a block to economic recovery". Following a lengthy campaign, the then newly formed Transport for London agreed to revert most of the streets to <b>two-way</b> <b>working,</b> a project which was completed in late 2002.|$|E

For a brief period in summer 2006, the line terminated at Hatton Cross and shuttle buses also ran to Terminals 2 & 3 while the track configuration and tunnels were altered for the Terminal 5 link from that station.

50|$|On 6 January 1969 the Waverley Route {{closed to}} through traffic, {{together}} with the connecting spur from Port Carlisle Branch Junction to Canal Junction, and the line to the reversing siding at Stainton Junction for trains from Kingmoor Yard; the last named was only six years old. The portion of the Waverley route as far as Longtown was retained until 31 August 1970, when the line was shortened to serve only RAF Brunthill, {{just north of the}} bridge where the Waverley Route had crossing the Caledonian, main line. The line between Mossband Junction and Bush-on-Esk, on the old Longtown to Gretna line, was retained for the time being to serve an ordnance depot, reverting to <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> for the purpose.|$|E
50|$|It {{was clear}} that the {{signalling}} technology was the responsibility of the individual Reichsbahn divisions. While the Ludwigsfelde-Dennewitz section, which was controlled by the Berlin Reichsbahn division, was equipped until 1978 with track plan interlockings (including the first interlocking of the GsIIISp68 class in Jüterbog station) and automatic block signalling, the Niedergörsdorf-Leipzig section, which was controlled by the Halle Reichsbahn division, continued to be signalled with conventional systems. As part of its resignalling with the Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung train protection system the remaining semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals. During the upgrade to 200 km/h, the whole line was equipped with electronic interlockings between 1992 and 1999. Since then continuous <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> has been possible, using only Kombinationsignale(combination signals). During the remodelling of Muldenstein station, moveable point frogs were inserted into the continuous track at the northern end of the station. In addition, all level crossings were eliminated and new bridges were built. These included the northern Mulde flood bridge near Muldenstein, the Mulde bridge and the Leine bridge. These three new prestressed concrete girder bridges replaced arch bridges built in 1857.|$|E

The two-way {{communication}} mode used for sending messages to processors of interconnection networks via vertex-disjoint paths in one communication step is investigated. The complexity of communication algorithms {{is measured by}} the number of communication steps (rounds). This paper establishes a direct relationship between the gossip complexity and the vertex bisection width. More precisely, the main results are the following: 1. The lower bound 2 log 2 n Γ log 2 k Γ log 2 log 2 k Γ 2 is proved on the number of rounds of every <b>two-way</b> gossip algorithm <b>working</b> on any graph Gn;k of n nodes and vertex bisection k. 2. A graph Gn;k of n nodes and vertex bisection k, and a two-way gossip algorithm for Gn;k is constructed working in 2 log 2 n Γ log 2 k Γ log 2 log 2 k + 2 rounds.

The complexity of communication algorithms is measured by the number of communication steps (rounds). Here, the complexity of gossiping in grids and in planar graphs is investigated. The main results are the following: 1. Effective one-way and two-way gossip algorithms for d-dimensional grids, d ≥ 2, are designed. 2.

This proves that the designed two-way gossip algorithms on d-dimensional grids, d ≥ 3, are almost optimal, and it also shows that the 2 -dimensional grid belongs to the best gossip graphs among all planar graphs. 3. Another lower bound proof is developed to get some tight lower bounds on one-way "well-structured" gossip algorithms on planar graphs (to the best of the authors′ knowledge, to date all gossip algorithms designed in vertex-disjoint paths mode have been "well-structured") ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} researched, {{reasoned}} and evidenced on a statement which argues that although FA'ASAMOA {{is not fully}} recognised, it has a role in social work in New Zealand, because the rapid increase of Samoan client-population demands the implementation of FA'ASAMOA by Samoan social workers as it is ethnically empowering, therapeutic, practicable, significant, effective, natural and experiential as a living system in facilitating a <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Samoans {{within the context of}} social work in Aotearoa New Zealand. Samoan social workers in Aotearoa prefer the less formal implementation of FA'ASAMOA because of the scope it provides for flexibility and the development of closer interaction between Samoan social workers and Samoan clients. This indicates that Samoan social workers in New Zealand are more likely to adapt FA'ASAMOA {{to take advantage of the}} new opportunities, the environment in which they practice, and the nature of Samoan clients with whom they work. This study is supported by data and information gained from implementing qualitative research techniques, including the use of unstructured as well as semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions with the participants. This thesis is distinctive in that it is a study of FA'ASAMOA as a comprehensive culture in social work in Aotearoa New Zealand...|$|E
