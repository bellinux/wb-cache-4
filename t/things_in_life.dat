5|$|The next day, an {{argument}} erupts between Santosh and Subramaniam {{during which the}} former becomes emotional and shouts that he has lost so many small <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> because of Subramaniam. But he preferred to stay calm as {{he does not want}} to hurt his father. Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but had never thought that they are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

25|$|Avery's first {{motion picture}} role (other than {{a bit in}} the film version of Winged Victory) was as Marjorie in the 1951 film Queen for a Day based on the popular radio and {{television}} show hosted by Jack Bailey. In 1952, she played Tracy McAuliffe, the wife of the Charlton Heston character in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Ruby Gentry. She also was in The Best <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Are Free (1956).|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was largely}} {{accepted}} into white society, both {{on stage and}} off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone. As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was {{very careful not to}} flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

25|$|A man {{of great}} energy and drive, Newsam's {{tendency}} to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant {{that he was not}} automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{association}} of Venus to Metal appears at first {{fundamentally different from}} Western notions of love and romance. In Babylonian mythology, her equivalent was Ishtar, goddess of both love and war. The Chinese metal representative is unyielding and forceful, set in their ways and taciturn; yet Venus' Western element is air, which is logical and sanguine. Metal is also sophisticated, and enjoys the good <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> In Western astrology, Venus rules both Libra, which is sophisticated, logical, and romantic, and Taurus, which is reserved, sensual, and unyielding. Some Western astrologers believe that metal is better associated with the qualities of the planet Saturn, arguing that metal equates to air in the western system, and that Saturn is linked to air in Vedic astrology.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made {{for children of}} the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and {{based on what they}} see in media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations {{of what used to be}} common.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Jemima's tale still retains {{elements}} of Wollstonecraft's bourgeois ethos; Jemima {{and the other}} working-class women are only presented as Maria's equal in suffering; [...] "women are linked across class, then, but less in solidarity than in hopelessness." [...] As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor comments, [...] "Maria's relationship with Jemima displays something of the class fissures and prejudices that have marked organised feminist politics from their inception." [...] Jemima is taught to appreciate the finer <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> when she is a kept mistress and Maria later promises to care for her. Importantly, though, in one version of the ending, it is Jemima who rescues Maria and finds her child.|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Luis Leal, in {{the genre}} of magic realism, [...] "the writer confronts reality and tries to untangle it, to {{discover}} what is mysterious in <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> in human acts." [...] Magic realist writing does not create imaginary creatures or places; instead, the writer tries to display [...] "the mysterious relationship between man and his circumstances". Leal further {{points out that in}} magic realism, [...] "key events have no logical or psychological explanation. The magical realist does not try to copy the surrounding reality or to wound it but to seize the mystery that breathes behind things." [...] He also clarifies that [...] "magical realism is not magic literature either. Its aim, unlike that of magic, is to express emotions, not to evoke them".|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{explained}} that her fifth studio album The Definition Of... (2016) expanded on the [...] "rock soul" [...] sound that she introduced on her previous release Side Effects of You (2013). She defined [...] "rock soul" [...] as encompassing multiple genres, explaining {{it as an}} attempt to combine her soulful childhood singing in church with [...] "a certain side of [...] that wants to tap into that whole rock world". She explained on Instagram that the title and lyrics for [...] "No Time for It" [...] were influenced by her beliefs: [...] "There are some <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> that I simply have 'No Time for It. In an interview with Essence, she followed this up by saying: [...] "No time for family drama. If you’re gonna be my friend, come in and be strong. I can’t cater to you, I can’t always let you borrow, borrow, borrow if you can’t give me nothing !" ...|$|E

500|$|Songz {{said that}} {{compared}} to his previous albums, [...] "this album is very adult, very easygoing and very sexy [...] My first album was very adult-like, {{but in a}} different, more soulful, sample-driven kind of way, and my second one was more contemporary and trendy." [...] To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids. Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and [...] "tasteful" [...] shoes. On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, {{and the head of}} Songbook Entertainment, Troy Taylor said, [...] "Trey's from the streets, he's a hood kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his street-ism, [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' and then he got the ladies' opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{nine months}} on the sidelines, Jesé returned from injury for the second leg of Real Madrid's tie against UE Cornellà in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on 2 December 2014, replacing Sami Khedira after 57 minutes and scoring the last goal of a 9–1 aggregate victory. On his injury, Jesé stated: [...] "I had a very tough time, but I think that <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> happen for a reason. Maybe I had the injury because I needed to learn and become a more mature footballer." [...] Later that month he {{was included in the}} club's squad which won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, making a substitute appearance in a 4–0 win over Cruz Azul in the semi-finals. He scored the first of his three La Liga goals for the season on 4 February 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. Jesé struggled to break back into the first team following his injury though, starting only 3 of his 23 appearances for the season, {{and by the end of}} the campaign it was reported that he had grown frustrated at the club and was looking to leave in the summer.|$|E
