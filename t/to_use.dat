5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own the right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player <b>to</b> <b>use</b> talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. <b>To</b> <b>use</b> the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player <b>to</b> <b>use</b> four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

5|$|While filming Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die {{was chosen}} as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring <b>to</b> <b>use</b> black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial {{movements}} were active at this time. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and since he was a jazz fan, Mankiewicz suggested he film in New Orleans. Hamilton did not want <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Mardi Gras since Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festivity, so after more discussions with the writer and location scouting with helicopters, he decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals.|$|E
