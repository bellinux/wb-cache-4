While the book's {{storytelling}} virtues are enormous, you don't {{have to be}} a bluestocking of political correctness to find some of this fantasy anti-Arab, or anti-Eastern, or anti-Ottoman.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> in The Mask which capture this {{landscape}} {{just as it}} was changing from that of the horse to that of the motor car. The farmer Wilks still has a horse and cart. However the taxi driver was a ploughman fifteen years before, and the local smithy is now a garage and petrol station. The bus, the train and walking are still preferred methods of travel for the majority, though, and even the car-owning gentry at the Georgian House are familiar with public transport timetables.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Penderecki was {{commissioned}} by Solidarity to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the Gdańsk shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with Lacrimosa, which he later expanded {{into one of the}} best known works of his later period, the Polish Requiem (1980–84, 1993, 2005). Again the harmonies are rich, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> which recall his work in the 1960s. In recent years, he has tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the Credo. He conducted Credo {{on the occasion of the}} 70th birthday of Helmuth Rilling, 29 May 2003.|$|E

25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{praised the}} music: [...] "Brayson's catchy score, which moves deftly through swing, blues, jazz and early rock'n'roll can rise to good old showbiz brassiness when needed". Henry Hitchings of the Evening Standard gave a mixed {{view of the}} music, [...] "There are seductive melodies {{and a couple of}} {{genuinely}} catchy songs. But it never settles into a single confident idiom, and between the big numbers there are lulls, especially in the overlong first half." [...] Letts praised Campbell for his vocal talents, stating that he [...] "does some worthy old-fashioned crooning – in a pleasant song called 'Marking Time' <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when he actually sounds like Nat King Cole." ...|$|E
500|$|The ad was {{conceived}} {{by the agency}} Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: [...] "Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag." [...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene.

500|$|Rasheed is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun, a shoemaker, and the {{antagonist}} of the novel. He marries Mariam through an arrangement with Jalil, and later marries Laila as well. After suffering years of domestic abuse at his hands, Mariam bludgeons Rasheed {{to death with}} a shovel during a violent struggle. Hosseini stated that he hoped to create a multi-layered character in Rasheed, saying, [...] "Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to write him as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> of humanity, such as his love for his son." [...] He identified an encounter with an Afghan man four years earlier as the foundation for this character; the man [...] "had a very sweet, subservient wife" [...] and had not yet informed her that he was planning to marry again.|$|E
500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E

500|$|At the Paley Festival Glee {{panel in}} March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana {{would be seen}} to make out during the show's first season. Morris and Rivera only became aware of this after reading a Paley Festival report online. When they asked Murphy about the development, {{he claimed to have}} made the {{statement}} [...] "to get a kick" [...] out of the [...] "dirty guy" [...] asking about them. Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were [...] "organic and natural." [...] While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: [...] "that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and being really close. It's always her and I just messing around and they end up using it." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|In late September 2014, Guggenheim {{revealed}} that the Arrow episode would be titled [...] "The Brave and The Bold", {{a reference to a}} title shared by many comic book series published by DC Comics which feature super-hero team-ups, including the Flash and Green Arrow. Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow".

500|$|Jordan Sowunmi of Exclaim! {{stated that}} the album excels when Hopsin [...] "focuses on {{external}} obsessions: ode to amateur skating 'Nollie Tre Flip' has the most enticingly offbeat rapping on the album, {{as well as a}} dizzying internal rhyme scheme, while 'Turn on the Lights' analogue 'Dream Forever' is heartfelt and raw." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album's consistency for providing [...] "shocking lyrics and infectious hooks", highlighting 'Rip Your Heart Out' featuring Tech N9ne as a standout track. Dominick Grillo of DJBooth noted that Hopsin's [...] "technical passionate wordplays offer constant comparisons to Eminem", concluding that the album is [...] "a dark, often violent creative response to the pressure now resting on Hopsin's shoulders", conceding that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when Hopsin [...] "weighs himself (and the audience) down with layers upon layers of negativity", though admitting that the album [...] "works best when Hopsin is either angrily fighting or humorously poking fun at some sort of ludicrosity." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{consumer}} {{magazines and}} newspapers generally gave Gone with the Wind excellent reviews. However, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while {{it was the most}} ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an [...] "interesting story beautifully told". Franz Hoellering of The Nation was of the same opinion: [...] "The result is a film which is a major event {{in the history of the}} industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
60|$|Janet's own {{feelings}} were a medley. It was not, of course, contentment she knew continually, nor even peace, although <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>moments</b> when these stole over her. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>moments,</b> despite her incredible good fortune, of apprehension when she shrank from the future, when fear assailed her; moments of intense sadness {{at the thought}} of leaving her friends, of leaving this enchanted place now that miraculously she had found it; moments of stimulation, of exaltation, when she forgot. Her prevailing sense, as she found herself again, was of thankfulness and gratitude, of determination to take advantage of, to drink in all of this wonderful experience, lest any precious memory be lost.|$|R

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the song}} was generally positive. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC felt the song's lyrics were generic, but complimented Cyrus vocals: [...] "Miley acquits herself well vocally — <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> where her voice sounds a tad strained, but it's good to hear her on a track that's a little more subdued and with less frantic production than the uptempo, sassy pop songs we're used to." [...] Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine called the song [...] "one of the year's strongest ballads". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe praised [...] "The Climb" [...] for being a [...] "pretty liberation anthem". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "On tunes like [...] 'The Climb', the 16-year-old Tennessee native turns up her homegrown inflections, but a few elongated r's won't exactly shut out her huge pop audience." [...] Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times believed that [...] "The Climb" [...] was [...] "buried in cheese" [...] and described it as [...] "pre-Valentine's Day gooeyness". However, Martens said, [...] "'The Climb' is the rare Miley ballad that's on par with some of her more spunky teen pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Paton of musicOMH {{said that}} [...] "Life Is People may not quite be the {{masterpiece}} {{so many people}} dearly want it to be...that being said, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> here so sublime and moving that could only have come from Fay." [...] Pitchfork reviewer Grayson Currin remarked that [...] "Life Is People and the tale that accompany it are strong enough...to at last make [...] reputation among many match his legacy among few", saying that [...] "at the risk of overstating the case, Life Is People—the work of a 69-year-old family man, {{and the work of}} a lifetime—confirms its maker's own thesis." [...] Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that [...] "one half of Fay's Life Is People proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life Is People touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year." [...] Prefix magazine's Matthew Fiander stated that while it [...] "does have its missteps...Life is People {{may not be the best}} Bill Fay, but hearing this there is no doubt about one thing: it's great to have him back.

500|$|The game's {{story has}} {{received}} {{a considerable amount of}} acclaim from reviewers. GamePro notes that [...] "the intense single-player campaign offers up an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> in the game that will send chills down your spine." [...] GameSpot mentioned that the fact the [...] "single-player campaign is over in a flash" [...] as the only major flaw. While IGN described the campaign as [...] "still very linear" [...] like that of its predecessors, [...] "eschewing the concept of sandbox gameplay," [...] it noted that this resulted in [...] "a much richer, more focused experience" [...] with [...] "beautifully scripted set pieces." [...] IGN's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it [...] "virtually plays on a rail, but that's part of its charm." [...] In contrast to later entries in the Call of Duty franchise, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw of Zero Punctuation gave the game a positive review, praising how it [...] "never sacrifices gameplay for story, or vice versa" [...] and that it featured [...] "less of the smarmy, black-and-white, 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee' jingoism that turns me off most war games".|$|E
