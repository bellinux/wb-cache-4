5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
25|$|In Ibn Fadlan's {{eyewitness}} {{account of a}} Viking funeral, there is {{a description of a}} slave girl who was to be sacrificed and who had to undergo several sexual rites. When the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders. Every man told her that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did for their love to the dead chieftain. Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed. The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attracted}} near universal acclaim. The Spooks producers regard [...] "Nuclear Strike" [...] as one {{of their}} favourites in the series. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian reacted positively to the episode, stating [...] "it's nice to see MI5 locking horns with the Russians again. Maybe the Spooks people just got bored with Islamic terrorism, so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had to do: they restarted the cold war. A bold move, but an admirable one." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph placed the episode as a [...] "critic's choice," [...] calling it a [...] "superb season closer," [...] and [...] "all terrifically exciting." [...] O'Donovan also said of the episode's settings; [...] "the streets and Underground tunnels of London have rarely been used to such climactic effect – with great performances from everyone involved." [...] He also complimented it for setting up a [...] "great cliffhanger ending that will leave fans absolutely gagging for the next series." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{apparent}} that women would eventually be allowed {{to serve in the}} Navy: the question was, in what form? [...] The quandary for the Navy was how to administer a woman's program, yet fashion it to its own liking. [...] Then <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had often done before, turn to academia for help. This time the Navy asked women educators for assistance, first contacting Dr. Virginia C. Gildersleeve, [...] dean of Barnard College. [...] She suggested that Professor Elizabeth Reynard, also of Barnard, become a special assistant to Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, Chief of Naval Personnel. [...] Reynard was well known for the academic work she had done on women in the work place. But her first-rate performance as Jacob's assistant silenced any fears the Navy may have had about women educators. Reynard quickly formed the Women's Advisory Council to meet with Navy officials. [...] Gildersleeve became the chairperson. Because of her efforts eight prominent women agreed to serve on the council. They included: ...|$|E
500|$|Buffalo {{finished}} the following season with another 9–5 record {{and made the}} playoffs as the AFC's wildcard team. The Bills, however, lost their first playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers and were eliminated from the tournament. Saban said after the game that the Steelers' offensive domination was the deciding factor. [...] "I'm not sure how <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did against us, but they blew us out", he said. Buffalo went on to an 8–6 season in 1975, failing to make the playoffs. After the Bills got out to a 2–3 start in 1976, Saban resigned. He was reportedly angry about how Bills owner Ralph Wilson handled the re-signing of Simpson, who had demanded a trade {{at the beginning of}} the season. Saban was replaced by Jim Ringo, who he had hired as an assistant in 1972. Wilson held a grudge against Saban for the rest of his life after his second resignation, refusing to put Saban on the Bills' Wall of Fame because, in Wilson's words, [...] "he quit on me twice!" [...] Walt Patulski, the Bills' first overall draft pick in 1972, also held ill will toward Saban after Buffalo, believing that Saban tried to force his personality onto Patulski and that the effort effectively ruined his career; Patulski would never speak to Saban again after their respective times in Buffalo, despite multiple opportunities to do so.|$|E

2500|$|... "Antislavery men", such as John Quincy Adams, did {{not call}} slavery a sin. They called it an evil feature of society as a whole. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but {{were not part of}} any {{abolitionist}} group. For example, in 1841, John Quincy Adams represented the Amistad African slaves in the Supreme Court of the United States and argued that they should be set free. In the last years before the war, [...] "antislavery" [...] could refer to the Northern majority, such as Abraham Lincoln, who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas–Nebraska Act or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians.|$|E
2500|$|On March 14, finalist Jermaine Jones was disqualified for concealing {{arrests and}} {{outstanding}} warrants. Jones, however, {{denied that he}} had concealed his previous arrests, as he admitted his arrests when he signed up for Idol. A police official in a New Jersey town {{where he was the}} target of two arrest warrants said that [...] "the case wasn't big enough to merit going after him in California", and a New Jersey legislator commented that for the show [...] "to expose, embarrass and interrogate a young man without an attorney in front of 40 million viewers was an outrage". Critics suggested that the show may have staged the disqualification to boost ratings. When asked about speculations that producers had prior knowledge of his criminal past and that the producers were simply out to exploit him on-air, Jones replied that [...] "I haven’t even taken my mind into that and why <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did, because then I’ll drive myself crazy".|$|E
2500|$|Under Pennsylvania {{law of the}} time, {{any state}} {{employee}} who learned about suspected child abuse was required to report the incident to his immediate supervisor. In {{the case of the}} 2002 incident, McQueary reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Paterno. [...] In turn, Paterno reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Curley, and also reported it to Gary Schultz, who oversaw the campus police at the time. For these reasons, Paterno and McQueary were not implicated in any criminal wrongdoing, since <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were legally required to do. [...] However, once the incident came to light, Paterno was criticized for not reporting the incident to police, or, at least, seeing to it that it was reported. [...] Several advocates for victims of sexual abuse argued that Paterno should have faced charges for not going to the police himself when it was apparent Penn State officials were unwilling to act.|$|E
