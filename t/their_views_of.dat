5|$|In 2006, Dhondup Wangchen {{and friend}} Jigme Gyatso, a senior Tibetan monk, {{conceived}} of a documentary interviewing ordinary Tibetan people on <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the Dalai Lama and the Chinese {{government in the}} year {{leading up to the}} 2008 Beijing Olympics. The documentary was to be called Leaving Fear Behind. The pair coordinated their efforts with a Dhondup Wangchen's cousin Gyaljong Tsetrin, who remained in Switzerland. In preparation for likely reprisals by the Chinese government, Dhondup Wangchen moved his wife, Llamo Tso, and their four children to Dharamsala, India.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} differ in <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> {{the ethics of}} birth control. The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning, {{although}} large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control. Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

During the summer, the view includes the seasonal semi-weekly fireworks displays over the lake from Navy Pier. The restaurant holds a five-star rating, according to the Forbes Travel Guide (formerly Mobil Travel Guide), {{making it one of}} only 3 restaurants in the city to attain such a rating in 2015, and a two-star rating by the Michelin Guide. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, it was one of only 5 restaurants in the city to achieve at least a two-star Michelin rating.|$|E
5|$|Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused {{with the}} 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, {{on the morning}} of 31 May, he {{organised}} {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at the head of the line of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the King George Vs were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people in}} Muslim-majority {{countries}} also see Islam manifested politically as Islamism. Political Islam is powerful in some Muslim-majority countries.

40|$|Even {{though there}} is much {{research}} related to {{the teaching and learning}} of K- 12 mathematics, there are few studies in the literature related to university professors’ teaching. In this research report, I investigated how three professors of mathematics education structure their graduate level curriculum courses. The results show that three factors influence the ways that the professors design this course: (a) <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> mathematics curriculum, (b) <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> graduate students’ contributions to classroom atmosphere, and (c) their learning goals for the graduate students...|$|R

25|$|A few {{critics have}} found what they {{consider}} to be racial elements in the story, generally based upon <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> how Tolkien's imagery depicts good and evil, characters' race (e.g. Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, Númenórean, Orc); and that the character's race is seen as determining their behaviour. Counter-arguments note that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence to the contrary, cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself; ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life, and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said that the nuances of the term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E

500|$|Although reviewers were {{polarized}} in <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> {{the episode}} as a whole, the special within the episode received mostly favorable comments, though {{the rest of}} the episode was deemed light on plot.

Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.13million American viewers and garnered a 3.0/8Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.
