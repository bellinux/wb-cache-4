The wind <b>turbine</b> <b>machine</b> requires a regular maintenance to guarantee an acceptable lifetime and to minimize production loss. In order to implement a fast, proactive condition monitoring, ESPRIT-TLS method seems the correct choice due to its robustness in improving the frequency and amplitude detection. Nevertheless, it has a very complex computation to implement in real time. To avoid this problem, a Fast-ESPRIT algorithm that combined the IIR band-pass filtering technique, the decimation technique and the original ESPRIT-TLS method were employed to enhance extracting accurately frequencies and their magnitudes from the wind stator current. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated by computer simulations with many fault scenarios.

The target of present investigation was to test the optical technique during combustion tests campaign, in order to couple it to an acoustic one in a future activity to be developed on the same experimental setup.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{interactions}} between the leading edge of a blade and incoming vortical structures produce a sharp rise in pressure, contributing significantly to the noise production in fans, <b>turbine</b> <b>machines,</b> etc. Active control of interactions between an airfoil and incoming cylinder-generated vortices has been presently investigated. The essence of the control is to create a local perturbation, using piezo-ceramic actuators, on the surface near {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil, thus modifying the airfoil-vortex interactions. Both open- and closed-loop controls are used, where the surface perturbation was controlled by an external sinusoidal wave and a feedback pressure signal from a pressure transducer installed at the leading edge, respectively. Experiments were carried out in a wind tunnel. It was observed that the closed-loop control was superior to the open-loop one; the closed- and open-loop controls achieve a maximum reduction in the pressure fluctuation at the dominant vortex frequency by 73 % and 44 %, respectively...|$|R
