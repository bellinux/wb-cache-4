According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by Twitty, the video cameras at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished. Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straaten —the initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement— said that Holloway did not have to go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> to return to her room.|$|E
25|$|The void which {{cuts through}} the entire height of the building, and this was {{intentionally}} done by the architect to visually connect {{the upper and lower}} spaces. This longitudinal void opens to a rooftop skylight, bringing in natural daylight into the atrium below. The typical dependence of artificial lighting for a building of this size would typically account for more than 13% of its electricity use. However, with the installation of this void, a great portion of that cost is reduced. This spatial device was intended as a sustainable element of the design, as seen in many of Foster’s projects, it is an effective solution to reducing electricity consumption which is vital to a structure of this scale. The most important aspect that this vertical void contributes to the building is that is creates a distinctive social space for its users. Norman Foster has been experimenting and studying with the reconfiguration of spaces and the natural lighting conditions to redefine institutions. This void creates a vast, open, daylight space for the students to gather and relax in between classes. Also, the 23 research laboratories and teaching laboratories are intentionally planned and organized in such a manner where they are fully integrated into other programs- service spaces for faculty members, students and administrators. These programs are connected by bridges which cross the void at the upper floors. As for the pods which are suspended {{in the middle of the}} atrium, these mysterious pods were intentionally designed to give the illusion of defying gravity due to their size and weight. One architectural detail that most be noted, the bottom of the glass-clad cube of the larger volume was specifically designed to line up with the cornices of its adjacent historic buildings. Furthermore, the bottom of the new building will be transparent so that the older buildings will be visible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> says David Nelson of Foster and Partners.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything {{that goes on in}} this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Tides 5–6ft (1.5–2m) {{above normal}} and storm surge in St. Petersburg damaged or {{destroyed}} all four fishing piers. Many ships and boats of all sizes capsized or were beached, including the trawler Hypnotist, which ejected the crew of seven into the water, {{all of whom were}} rescued. The St. Petersburg Beach Hotel was destroyed, after employees swam <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> for safety. At the office of the St. Petersburg Times, then located at Fifth Street and First Avenue South, the loss of electricity resulted in staff working overnight with lanterns.

500|$|In 1982, Alonzo Mann, who {{had been}} Frank's office boy {{at the time of}} Phagan's murder, told The Tennessean that he had seen Jim Conley alone shortly after noon {{carrying}} Phagan's body <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> toward the ladder descending into the basement. Though Mann's testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue, it was the basis of an attempt by Charles Wittenstein, southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, and Dale Schwartz, an Atlanta lawyer, to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The board also reviewed the files from Slaton's commutation decision. It denied the pardon in 1983, hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records. It concluded that, [...] "After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation, it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank. For the board to grant a pardon, the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively." [...] At the time, the lead editorial in The Atlanta Constitution began, [...] "Leo Frank has been lynched a second time." ...|$|E

The dining room was two stories high, with floor to ceiling windows, white marble floor, white painted walls, and a fresco on the ceiling. The dining room was {{in the rear of}} the hotel, on the site of what used to be Farnham House (which in {{photographs}} from the period shows as the last three windows on 14th Street).

6000|$|One day I {{walked past}} Miss Bates's little sanctum Remingtorium, and {{saw in her}} place a black-haired unit--unmistakably a person--pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys.

Returning, I strolled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the Acropolis, and saw, with a little warm glow of auld lang syne, Miss Bates, as Grecian and kind and flawless as ever, just putting the cover on her machine.

60|$|In fact, no one {{answered}} Barbara's knock, and discovering that the door yielded, she walked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> past the clerk's den, converted to a kitchen, into the sitting-room. It was empty. She {{had never been to}} Miltoun's rooms before, and she stared about her curiously. Since he did not practise, much of the proper gear was absent. The room indeed had a worn carpet, a few old chairs, and was lined from floor to ceiling with books. But the wall space between the windows was occupied by an enormous map of England, scored all over with figures and crosses; and before this map stood an immense desk, on which were piles of double foolscap covered with Miltoun's neat and rather pointed writing. Barbara examined them, puckering up her forehead; she knew that he was working at a book on the land question; but she had never realized that the making of a book requited so much writing. Papers, too, and Blue Books littered a large bureau on which stood bronze busts of AEschylus and Dante.|$|E
60|$|Within doors, matters {{were even}} yet more threatening. Lord George--preceded {{by a man}} who carried the immense {{petition}} on a porter's knot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> {{to the door of the}} House of Commons, where it was received by two officers of the house who rolled it up to the table ready for presentation--had taken his seat at an early hour, before the Speaker went to prayers. His followers pouring in at the same time, the lobby and all the avenues were immediately filled, as we have seen. Thus the members were not only attacked in their passage through the streets, but were set upon within the very walls of Parliament; while the tumult, both within and without, was so great, that those who attempted to speak could scarcely hear their own voices: far less, consult upon the course it would be wise to take in such extremity, or animate each other to dignified and firm resistance. So sure as any member, just arrived, with dress disordered and dishevelled hair, came struggling through the crowd in the lobby, it yelled and screamed in triumph; and when the door of the House, partially and cautiously opened by those within for his admission, gave them a momentary glimpse of the interior, they grew more wild and savage, like beasts at the sight of prey, and made a rush against the portal which strained its locks and bolts in their staples, and shook the very beams.|$|E

6000|$|We remember, in one {{of those}} ancient Gilray portfolios, a print which used to cause a sort of terror in us {{youthful}} spectators, and in which the Prince of Wales (his Royal Highness was a Foxite then) was represented as sitting alone in a magnificent hall after a voluptuous meal, and using a great steel fork {{in the guise of a}} toothpick. Fancy the first young gentleman living employing such a weapon in such a way! The most elegant Prince of Europe engaged with a two-pronged iron fork--the heir of Britannia with a BIDENT! The man of genius who drew that picture saw little of the society which he satirized and amused. Gilray watched public characters as they walked by the shop in St. James's Street, or passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the House of Commons. His studio was a garret, or little better; his place of amusement a tavern-parlor, where his club held its nightly sittings over their pipes and sanded floor. You could not have society represented by men to whom it was not familiar. When Gavarni came to England a few years since--one of the wittiest of men, one of the most brilliant and dexterous of draughtsmen--he published a book of [...] "Les Anglais," [...] and his Anglais were all Frenchmen. The eye, so keen and so long practised to observe Parisian life, could not perceive English character. A social painter must be of the world which he depicts, and native to the manners which he portrays.|$|E
60|$|I {{arrived at}} last at the clear {{realisation}} that my political associates, and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, priggish, and unreal, that the Socialists {{with whom we}} were attempting co-operation were preposterously irrelevant to their own theories, that my political life didn't in some way comprehend more than itself, that rather perplexingly I was missing the thing I was seeking. Britten's footnotes to Altiora's self-assertions, her fits of energetic planning, her quarrels and rallies and vanities, his illuminating attacks on Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited triviality of such Liberalism as the Children's Charter, served to point my way to my present conclusions. I {{had been trying to}} deal all along with human progress as something immediate in life, something to be immediately attacked by political parties and groups pointing primarily to that end. I now began to see that just as in my own being there was the rather shallow, rather vulgar, self-seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and bustled self-consciously <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> and a much greater and indefinitely growing unpublished personality behind him--my hinterland, I have called it--so in human affairs generally the permanent reality is also a hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws continually upon human experience and influences human action more and more, but which is itself never the actual player upon the stage. It is the unseen dramatist who never takes a call. Now it was just through the fact that our group about the Baileys didn't understand this, that with a sort of frantic energy they were trying to develop that sham expert officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate, and direct the affairs of humanity, that the perplexing note of silliness and shallowness that I had always felt and felt now most acutely under Britten's gibes, came in. They were neglecting human life altogether in social organisation.|$|E
