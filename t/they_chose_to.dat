5|$|Disney {{was unsure}} whether {{to release the}} film in theaters or direct-to-video. The studio was {{interested}} in Matthew McConaughey as Sparrow because of his resemblance to Burt Lancaster, who had inspired that script's interpretation of the character.

5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> sail alone.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> remain in the city. The number of men that remained was {{a significant factor in}} the creation of a homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess {{was shipped}} to Britain. The Irish Mercantile Marine ensured that Irish agricultural, and other, exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Some {{foods such as}} wheat, citric fruits and tea were imported. Ireland {{depended}} on, mainly, British tankers for petroleum. Initially Irish ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic.|$|E

Charles John Brandling of Gosforth House, the Member of Parliament for Newcastle between 1798 and 1812 and for Northumberland from 1820 until 1826, married Henrietta Armitage of Middleton. The Brandlings {{appointed}} John Blenkinsop to manage their collieries in Middleton and he was the hall's occupant in 1809. The hall was destroyed in a fire in 1962.|$|E

The father took up teaching at the Dissenter's Academy in Warrington and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of Lomonosov's history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.|$|E

5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Fernández as the Marlins' best {{prospect}} and {{the fifth}} best prospect in all of baseball. The Marlins invited Fernández to spring training but sent him to minor league camp before the season began. However, <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> add Fernández to their 25-man Opening Day roster, {{due in part to}} injuries to Nathan Eovaldi and Henderson Álvarez. Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would buy him goodwill with the fans, following a fire sale the previous offseason. He was planned to be limited to approximately 150 to 170 innings during the 2013 season in order to protect his development. He was the second youngest National League player that season, older only than the Nationals' Bryce Harper.|$|E
5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E

5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{started in}} Britain, {{with the use}} of plateways, canals and steam power. This led to {{dramatic}} increases in the productive capabilities of Britain, and created a need for new markets to sell its products. The Napoleonic Wars with France made this a difficult task, after Napoleon imposed the Continental System, which forbade his allies and conquests to trade with Britain. Thus Britain needed to be able to trade with the Spanish colonies, but could not do so because the colonies were restricted to trade only with their parent state. To achieve their economic objectives, Britain initially tried to invade Rio de la Plata and conquer key cities in Spanish America. When that failed, <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> promote the Spanish-American aspirations of emancipation from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which opened in 1827, directly affected the River Tone Navigation, as it provided a more direct route between Taunton and Bridgwater. The Conservators attempted to limit the supply {{of water from the}} river to the canal, while the canal company breached the river bank near Firepool lock, {{in order to ensure that}} boats could reach Taunton Bridge wharf from the canal. In order to compete with the canal, <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> reduce the tolls, although they were unsure of the legality of this action while they had outstanding debts. The canal company challenged their right to reduce the tolls in court, but the action was defeated, and the tolls remained at the lower level.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. <b>They</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attempts}} to regulate competitive ice hockey matches {{came in the}} late 1880s. Before then, teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal (the Montreals, the Crystals, the Victorias, and McGill University) and the Ottawa HC formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip Dansken Ross as its trustees; <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> award it to {{the best team in}} the AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. Since the Cup carried an air of nobility, its prestige greatly benefited the AHAC.|$|E
5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert. The film was {{directed by}} a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, titled Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
