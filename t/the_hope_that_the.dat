5|$|Despite the scuffle, Eliza {{was part}} of the royal party who {{accompanied}} Lunalilo when he sailed to Kailua-Kona, in November 1873, the following month, in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dry weather would improve his tuberculosis. However, the trip had no lasting effect on Lunalilo's health. After returning to Honolulu, Lunalilo succumbed to the disease and died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
5|$|During the autopsy, the {{pathologist}} of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein's brain for preservation {{without the}} permission of his family, in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neuroscience of the future {{would be able to}} discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army could {{withdraw to}} Japan {{by the end}} of the year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E

50|$|Constantly pausing {{the game}} or {{lowering}} game speed {{down to the}} slowest one, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> winning player will simply give up in frustration and quit, instead of finishing the game and defeating them.|$|R
50|$|The Arequipa Sanatorium, {{directed}} by Brown, was opened to serve {{women in the}} first stages of tuberculosis. At the time, the only known treatment was rest and good nutrition, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lungs could recover and heal.|$|R
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government would fall before {{he was forced to}} retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned {{in some way that}} 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and that he may have been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{toy store}} chains and online {{retailers}} sell diapers or nappies as a loss leader {{in order to}} entice parents into <b>the</b> store in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> children will spot toys, bottles or other items <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family [...] "needs".|$|R
50|$|An {{eligible}} receiver runs {{a predetermined}} {{number of steps}} or yards upfield before stopping and turning back in slightly to face <b>the</b> Quarterback, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defender cannot react and disrupt the pass before positive yardage is made.|$|R
50|$|To {{help bring}} about the {{fulfillment}} of the prophecy, the fugitive Anomalkan impregnated the earth female Prospera in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blending of their species would create {{a new breed of}} Anomalkan: strong and reliant enough to survive in Earth's environment.|$|R
5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the rebellious}} forces held out, however, and their stronghold was the {{virtually}} impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In {{the summer of}} 1266, a siege of the castle was initiated, but the effort proved futile. There were rumours that Montfort's son Simon was planning an invasion of England from Normandy, and this was <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rebels hung on to. It was in this situation that the papal legate Ottobuono Fieschi exerted his influence, to make the king pursue a more conciliatory policy. In August, the king summoned a parliament at Kenilworth, where the siege was ongoing. He commissioned a number of earls, barons and bishops to draft a treaty of reconciliation.|$|E
5000|$|Short {{term for}} long term goals: Women may use short term sexual {{relationships}} {{in order to}} assess a mate's value as a long term partner, or in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> short term arrangement will result in one that is long term.|$|R
5000|$|The {{capacity}} of a state is often {{measured in terms of}} its fiscal and legal capacity. Fiscal capacity meaning the state's ability to recover taxation to provide public goods, and legal capacity meaning the state's supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of coercion, the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence. In early and developing states, this role was often played by the [...] "stationary bandit" [...] who defended villagers from roving bandits, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, with <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth.|$|R
25|$|Many {{companies}} {{manufacture and}} distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat {{are some of}} the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist. The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company name will become more well known by the public.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery {{arranged}} the accommodations in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E
50|$|Tange disappears and {{everyone}} is wondering about his fate. He later appears after healing as a street performer, challenging anyone <b>that</b> would face <b>the</b> one armed swordsman, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men he sought would participate. His scheme is successful {{as one of the}} five kidnappers see him performing.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} methods involves having the would-be-mole “dangled” - <b>that</b> is luring <b>the</b> adversary intelligence service (or terrorist group) to recruit the opposition’s clandestine intelligence officer who is posing as a “walk-in” (someone who voluntarily offers information) - in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> adversary will unknowingly take the bait.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of the London Missionary Society missionaries, whose primary activity was teaching Christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the Bible as the principal Malagasy-language text, departed the island. James Cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize. The last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> restrictions might loosen, but one year later, after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure, they shuttered the LMS mission and left Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hosts {{would not have a}} lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
50|$|As {{the game}} {{took place on}} a hot, humid day, the Texans left the roof of Reliant Stadium open in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Steelers' {{performance}} would be hampered by their black jerseys. However, the tactic failed and Houston fans were angered by having to sit in sweltering conditions and watch their team lose.|$|R

25|$|In August 2006, Lagasse contributed several {{recipes to}} the meal {{selection}} aboard the International Space Station, {{as part of}} a general NASA effort {{to improve the quality of}} the food supply for astronauts. Lagasse's cuisine in particular was selected in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spicier fare would offset the reported tendency of microgravity to deaden flavors.|$|R
5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By {{the end of the first}} day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti {{believe that}} king Nynetjer, the third {{ruler of the}} Second dynasty and {{predecessor}} to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.|$|E
25|$|Following his retirement, Rundle and {{his family}} moved to {{southern}} California in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> climate would be beneficial to his wife's health. He and his wife, Hettie, lived in an old soldiers' home; Rundle died there in 1924, at age 81, and Hettie in 1931. They were buried side-by-side at the Los Angeles National Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The Ewings {{moved to}} Trull, Somerset, {{on his return}} in 1883, and in 1885, to Bath, in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> change of air would do her good. However, her health {{continued}} to deteriorate, and after two operations, she died there on 13 May 1885. She was given a military funeral at Trull three days later.|$|R
