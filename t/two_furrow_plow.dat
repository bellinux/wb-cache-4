50|$|Bukovo is a {{scattered}} village {{along the}} southwest slope of Mount Kojca (1303 m) on the saddle between the valleys of the Bača and Idrijca rivers. It also includes several hamlets {{southeast of the}} village center: Krtečne, Kojca, Selc, Žabže (or Žabče), and Laharn (from north to south). The soil is sandy and marly. The tilled fields lie on steep slopes, which traditionally necessitated carrying the last <b>furrow</b> <b>plowed</b> {{to the top of}} the slope by hand, or using oxen or a block-and-tackle system.|$|R
5000|$|Visitors can see {{competitors}} plow in the field. There {{are several}} different classes of plowing, {{taking place in}} different fields. The two main classes are horse plowing, and tractor plowing. Some different plowing classes for tractors include depend on how many <b>furrows</b> the <b>plow</b> has. Other tractor plowing classes include antique plowing, and 4H (youth) plowing. Plowing is [...] "judged for straightness, firmness, evenness, depth, shape and uniformity. A good <b>plowed</b> <b>furrow</b> must be straight with a smooth trough and clean, even sides." ...|$|R

The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{a second}} redoubt preceded the town of Schoeman's day. It was {{constructed}} of raw and burnt clay bricks, with cannons stationed on two bastions and loopholes in the walls. The subsequent market square, parsonage and church were in its immediate vicinity. Das Neves estimated that there were never more than 70 houses, though excavations at the site suggest a higher number. The town had a rectangular layout and all erven were of the same size. Fountain and stream water was channeled to town in <b>two</b> <b>furrows,</b> one of them 8 km long.|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of composting {{may influence the}} characteristics of the produced compounds. The experiment used three frequencies of plowing, combined with the conditions: with and without coverage of the composting patio, with and without the use of commercial inoculant, resulting in 12 furrows, installed on the Experimental Center of Agricultural Engineering (NEEA), of the STATE UNIVERSITY OF WEST PARANÁ (UNIOESTE), Campus of Cascavel city - state of Paraná (PR), in Brazil. The waste and quantities used in kg were: corn cob (7. 5); hatchery residue (5); floater sludge (31); ash (1); wheat cleaning residue (120); wheat pre-cleaning residue (120); corn peel (7. 5); solid fraction of wash trucks used to transport chickens (2); solid fraction of pig manure (1) and coal (5), totaling 300 kg of natural matter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of plowings, patio coverage and inoculation in losses of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe. The <b>furrows</b> <b>plowed</b> three times a week in the first month showed significant higher losses of N (p< 0. 05). The coverage of the composting patio influenced significantly the losses of N, K, Mg and Na (p< 0. 05). The produced compounds had a high agronomic value in relation to macro and micronutrients. It is recommended the use of patio coverage and plowing twice a week in the first month and once a week in the subsequent months for a compound with higher concentrations of nutrients...|$|R
30|$|Each plot {{contained}} four rows, spaced 150  cm {{apart and}} 4  m in length. Each tomato plant was placed 50  cm apart within each row and each plot had <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> for irrigation. All {{the samples were}} taken from the two middle rows of each plot. Tomato seeds of Early Urbana Y variety provided by Yekan Bazr Co. were used. Eight-week-old transplants were transplanted to the field by hand on the first week of June 2014 in the first year, and on the third week of May 2015 in the second year based on the weather condition.|$|R

5000|$|Smaller {{mesh sizes}} (between 10 and 18 cm) are usually used for {{horizontal}} tutoring of flowers, especially carnations, mums and snaps, because in floriculture growers prefer an opening that will support vertically the flower without letting it tilt or bend {{because it would}} lose its commercial value. Larger sized meshes are preferred for vegetable support. especially cucurbits, solanaceae and legumes. The reason horticulturalists prefer a larger mesh size (which simulates the hand weaved raffia systems) is so one can work the <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> {{on both sides of}} the walking isle, without damaging the crop or the plant during harvesting or trimming work.|$|R

50|$|This type of Dacian {{bracelet}} {{originated in}} the Bronze Age. The hoard found in 1980 at Hinova includes two such bracelets. Multi-spiral types can be dated to the early Hallstatt periodand comprises also open and closed-end bracelets. One of the spiral bracelets from Hinova weighed 261.55 grams and the other 497.13 grams. The former, made of a thinner and narrower gold leaf, had a decoration consisting of <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> cut along the edges and separated by a median crest. A similar decoration, of a furrow along the median line, decorates a metal bracelet from the deposit found at Sânnicolau Român, dated to the second period of the Bronze Age.|$|R
5000|$|Gluteus minimus {{appears as}} {{lenticular}} (lens-shaped), bilobed fossils, {{with a size}} up to 11 x 8 mm. In a sample of 400 specimens, the median diameter was 7.4 mm, {{with a range of}} 4.5 - 10.0 mm. Each fossil has two dissimilar surfaces - one smooth with one or rarely <b>two</b> <b>furrows,</b> and one with conspicuous [...] "growth lines", parallel with {{the outer edge of the}} fossil. The overall shape is broadly symmetrical, but the furrow is almost always on the same side of the [...] "re-entrant" [...] (the cleft between the two halves). Opposite the re-entrant is a [...] "salient", which separates two indentations in the margin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subterranean}} traps are white, lacking chlorophyll or {{any other}} pigmentation. They consist of a cylindrical stalk, widening at some distance below the surface into a hollow bulb-like utricle, and continuing as a hollow cylinder some further distance. At this point the stalk [...] into <b>two</b> <b>furrowed</b> spirals, between which the cylinder opening acts as the trap entrance. The furrows of the spiraled trap arms are lined with hairs pointing inward and toward the bifurcation. The hollow cylinder section leading from the bifurcation to the utricle is likewise lined with upward-pointing curved hairs. Some species produce two trap forms, one shorter and one longer, which probably target different prey groups.|$|R

50|$|Bharattherium molariforms are high, curved teeth, with {{a height}} of 6 to 8.5 mm. In a number of teeth {{tentatively}} identified as fourth lower molariforms (mf4), {{there is a large}} furrow {{on one side and a}} deep cavity (infundibulum) in the middle of the tooth. Another tooth, perhaps a third lower molariform, has <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> on one side and three infundibula on the other. The tooth enamel has traits that have been interpreted as protecting against cracks in the teeth. The hypsodont (high-crowned) teeth of sudamericids like Bharattherium are reminiscent of later grazing mammals, and the discovery of grass in Indian fossil sites contemporaneous with those yielding Bharattherium suggest that sudamericids were indeed grazers.|$|R
5000|$|In the Phacopidae {{a merger}} of the {{anterior}} {{and the two}} pairs of neighbouring lobes of the glabella forms a frontal lobe that expands forward and can be inflated and overhanging the frontal border. To {{the back of the}} glabella <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> (or sometimes one) cross the glabella forming two rings ("intercalating ring" [...] and [...] "occipital ring"). The cephalon does not end in genal spines. The side lobes of the thorax (or pleurae, singular pleura) have rounded ends. The pygidium is well rounded, semicircular or shorter, with an entire margin, and without lateral and posterior projections. In many Phacopidae, where the facial sutures are apparently continuous and well developed, they were evidently nonfunctional in ecdysis, since no separate free cheeks can be found.|$|R
30|$|This is {{the result}} of the cell {{cleavage}} from the earlier paired four-cell blastomeres. The cleavage, fourth mitotic division, was similar to the second mitotic cleavage. <b>Two</b> new <b>furrows</b> were established parallel to the earlier second mitotic division thereby resulting to 4 [*]×[*] 4 array blastomeres (Figure  2 G).|$|R
2500|$|The {{legs were}} {{proportionally}} short, the feet probably webbed and the hallux was vestigial or entirely absent; the tarsometatarsi (anklebones) resembled those of albatrosses while {{the arrangement of}} the front toes was more like in fulmars. Typical for pseudotooth birds was a second toe that attached a bit kneewards from the others and was noticeably angled outwards. The [...] "teeth" [...] were probably covered by the rhamphotheca in life, and there are <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> running along the underside of the upper bill just inside the ridges which bore the [...] "teeth". Thus, when the bill was closed only the upper jaw's [...] "teeth" [...] were visible, with the lower ones hidden behind them. Inside the eye sockets of at least some pseudotooth birds – perhaps only in the younger species – were well-developed salt glands.|$|R
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between Tijolos (Bricks) and Plantio (Plantation). In Tijolos, teams had to make 24 bricks of adobe, using a mold and their feet to mix the {{different}} materials (adobe, straw and water). Once the judge was satisfied with the bricks, teams would receive their next clue. In Plantio, teams first had {{to participate in a}} ritual for the earth's fertility and then, they had to <b>plow</b> <b>two</b> <b>furrows</b> to plant Oca. Once completed, teams would receive their next clue. In this Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to search through the labyrinth for different letters written in rocks, which would form the name of this Leg's Pit Stop: Piedra Sagrada. If teams figured out the correct location and received the judge's confirmation, they could proceed to the Pit Stop.|$|R
