The {{purpose of this}} dissertation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> characterize compliance and drop out rates using the cardiovascular disease IQ quiz and the life priorities questionnaire. It <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> examine both compliance and dropouts in this context because both diabetes and cardiovascular disease are emerging as {{a major focus of}} public health efforts in the United States and abroad. These diseases <b>are</b> accelerating due <b>to</b> the current trends in obesity, which is a preventable, modifiable risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the number seven and number one leading causes of death, respectively. We explore these concepts in a largely Hispanic border community in the Southwest, {{in the small town of}} Douglas, Arizona. The Hispanic population is increasing in the United States and is now the most populous minority group. Additionally, among this group are some of the highest rates of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and uncontrolled diabetes, all cardiovascular disease risk factors. We found that the cardiovascular disease IQ quiz was a much stronger predictor for compliance and drop out rates in this sample population than the life priorities questionnaire. Compliance did not seem to differ among the study participants who remained in the study. Interestingly, among the participants who were compliant, especially those who kept their eye check-up, were also those more likely to have health insurance and be employed. Though males only represented about 10 % of the population sample, they tended to drop out more frequently than females. Dropouts tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> younger, <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed,</b> and more educated.

In comparison to subjects still employed, retirees had a 51 % increase in all-cause mortality (95 % confidence interval: 16, 98). Among retirees, a 5 -year increase in age at retirement was associated with a 10 % decrease in mortality (95 % confidence interval: 4, 15).

40|$|The first Chair of Occupational Health in the United Kingdom was {{established}} by Manchester University in 1945 and held by Ronald Lane, a consultant physician and experienced factor doctor. In his department, occupational medicine was taught as a clinical discipline to both undergraduates and postgraduates.

Although work has become less hazardous, with major risks like pneumoconiosis and lead poisoning brought under control by better occupational hygiene and more effective epidemiology, {{there is still much}} work related illness and injury. Promoting occupational health in its broadest sense still depends on clinical skills to assess fitness for work and to identify responses to adverse factors in the environment. A university department, through its teaching and research, needs to ensure that occupational health is practised as a clinical discipline. Opportunities for research are extensive and include: (1) identifying the extent and severity of injury and illness due to adverse environmental agents and psychosocial factors; (2) assessing fitness among the disabled and the elderly in an aging population enabling them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gainfully</b> or otherwise <b>employed,</b> (3) improving techniques for measuring work exposures and human responses to adverse work factors, and (4) evaluating intervention procedures.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the thesis <b>were</b> <b>to</b> study effects of low maternal age on adverse pregnancy outcomes, predictors of teenage childbearing, and long-term effects of teenage motherhood on the women's social situation later in life and risk of premature death. The effects of low maternal age at first birth on risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, primarily preterm birth and infant mortality, were studied in three population-based cohort studies. We used the Swedish Medical Birth Register, the 1990 Population Census, and the population-based Education Register. The poorer pregnancy outcomes among teenagers aged 18 - 19 years are mainly an effect of a less favourable socio-economic situation. Infants of younger teenage mothers face an overall increased risk of preterm birth, neonatal and postneonatal mortality that is independent of socio-economic situation. The increased risk of neonatal mortality is entirely an effect of the increased risk of preterm birth. To study whether the increase in risk of poor pregnancy outcomes <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> low age per se, we also studied pregnancy outcomes at second birth in relation to age at first birth. When teenage childbearers had their second birth in adulthood, the risk of preterm birth has declined more than the corresponding risk decline among mother who also had their first birth in adulthood. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} young age is a risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes, independent of socio-economic conditions. To study familial and environmental effect as predictors of teenage childbearing, we linked the Swedish Twin Register to the Medical Birth Register. We used quantitative genetic analyses to evaluate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on the risk of teenage childbearing. We estimated the effect of life style factors, socio-economic situation, and personality traits on the likelihood of teenage childbearing, and if these factors could explain possible familial effects. Both familial and other environmental factors are important as predictors of teenage childbearing. We found significant effects of smoking habits, housing conditions, and educational level on the risk of teenage childbearing. However, the familial effect on teenage childbearing was not mediated by these factors. In two studies we analysed long-term socio-economic conditions and premature mortality of teenage mothers. We linked the following population-based registers: the Population Register, several Censuses, the Education Register, the Cause of Death Register, and a register of dependence on social welfare and disability pensions. Teenage childbearers face a considerably increased risk of a less favourable situation later in life. They <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed,</b> <b>to</b> have an unskilled occupation, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> single mothers, <b>to</b> have four or five infants, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on social welfare and receive disability pensions. Teenage mothers also face an increase in risk of premature death due to in particular cervical cancer, ischaemic heart disease, suicide and inflicted violence.

Contrary to much {{in print}} {{he did not}} go out proselytizing, believing that interest had to come from the people themselves: he did not want large numbers of ‘converts’ paying only lip-service to Christianity. Those who converted were expected to reside permanently at the Mission, going away ‘for a spell’ only after arranging it with him; their children had to come regularly to school where they learned to read and write in their own language, and the men had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed.</b> At Bethesda this meant working as shepherds, shearers, trackers and builders, and at Hermannsburg working as stockmen, branding, mustering, digging out the waterholes during the droughts, droving stock south to Oodnadatta, tracking, and also helping to construct Hermannsburg’s stone buildings, unlike Bethesda where mud bricks were used. Since the Mission always supplied those working with food and clothes and likewise their families, relatives not working were not allowed to share the food with them. Meals were served three times a day in the ‘Esshaus’, supervised mostly by Strehlow himself to prevent arguments. The government gave the Mission an annual grant of £300 to support the aged and infirm; all school children were fed and clothed. Frieda too became a fluent speaker of Aranda and exercised great influence on the young women and girls, opposing the widespread practice of infanticide (especially the killing of twins), [...] teaching them basic skills like sewing and mending, emphasizing the need for hygiene - daily washing, clean clothes, and so on - as well has how to raise their children using nappies. In this way she overcame the high infant mortality which had led anthropologists and others refer to aborigines as a ‘doomed race’. Religious instruction took place in the native languages and was a lengthy process of years, with people baptized only after they had proved that they were serious and not just trying to get food. Increasingly, senior members of the Christian community like Moses Tjalkabota and Nathanael Rauwiraka played a part in instructing new converts, and worked with Strehlow on his translations of religious texts.|$|E

Some of which are: the lack of skilled man- power, inadequate training facilities and equipment, lack of follow-up and continuity in government policies, poor remuneration of vocational and technical teachers, lack of entrepreneurship education in vocational technical education and training and poor emphasis on the practical aspect of vocational technical education and training. Finally, one of the major recommendations is that, both the government and the non government organizations (NGOs) should pay serious attention to entrepreneurship development in technical vocational education and training by putting its priorities right and releasing funds adequately for proper development of individuals to become self-reliant and contribute to national development...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to analyse the importance of women´s waged work with handicrafts for the household economy in the Swedish countryside {{during a period of}} rapid industrialisation and growth. The point of departure for the analysis has been a theoretical and methodological frame of interpretation on three levels. The levels that have been studied are the national institutional level of society, the level of the local society and the household level. This thesis has shown that women’s ways of providing for themselves cannot be explained with reference to any one factor. The explanation for the gender division of labour must be seen {{as the result of the}} interplay of several different factors on different levels. By investigating how the conditions for making a living looked like on the three different levels, the thesis has shown that, together, factors on the national institutional and the local societal levels, as well as on the individual household level, affected women’s work and how it can be understood.
