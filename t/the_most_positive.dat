5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 2005, the IOC {{released}} the inspection team's evaluation {{reports of the}} five candidate cities. Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings, the report for Paris was considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive,</b> followed closely by London, which had narrowed most of the gap observed {{at the time of}} the first-phase evaluation in 2004. New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid. On the same day, New York City's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the State of New York refused to fund West Side Stadium, a New York 2012 centrepiece. The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week, but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city's chances.|$|E

Wade {{quickly found}} {{success as a}} wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year.

Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record. It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional. During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season. Wade has stated that his high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.|$|E

25|$|It is unclear, however, how {{nicotine}} {{interacts with}} positive symptoms, {{as it would}} follow from this theory that nicotine would exacerbate excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway and thus positive symptoms as well. One theory argues that the beneficial effects of nicotine on negative symptoms outweigh possible exacerbation of positive symptoms. Another theory is based on animal models showing that chronic nicotine use eventually results in a reduction in dopamine, thus alleviating positive symptoms. However, human studies show conflicting results, including some studies that show that smokers with schizophrenia have <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> symptoms {{and a reduction in}} negative symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his time}} in Sarajevo, Prazina collaborated with Republika Srpska {{officials}} {{in a variety of}} criminal activities.

In his dealings with the VRS, Prazina even had written permission from the president of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadžić. During the siege, Prazina was also in contact with Radovan's son, Saša. Post-war revelations of these activities have served to sour Prazina's legacy among the Bosniak citizens of Sarajevo, who once considered him among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>positive</b> figures of the Bosnian war.|$|E
