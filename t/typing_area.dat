5000|$|The VideoWRITER {{became the}} {{principal}} {{product of the}} Philips/Magnavox division, [...] "Philips Home Interactive Systems" [...] (PHIS), after management decided to discontinue all development of video game consoles and home PCs (even though in 1984, the Magnavox Odyssey held 55% of worldwide console market share). This system was intended to bring $10,000 professional word processors to consumers, targeting {{high school and college}} students in particular. While in design, it was nicknamed the PWP, or the [...] "Little Orange" [...] (as the local University of Tennessee sports nickname was [...] "Big Orange"), but this was dropped when Coleco started using the name PWP.

5000|$|CNET {{praised the}} design of Surface, noting that it [...] "looked {{practical}} without being cold, and just feels like a high-quality device that Microsoft cut few corners to make." [...] The kickstand was also praised for its feel and quality, while both the kickstand and the keyboard cover accessories were also noted for having a [...] "satisfying" [...] clicking sound when engaged or attached. The covers were deemed [...] "essential to getting the complete Surface experience", with the touch cover praised for having a more [...] "spacious" [...] <b>typing</b> <b>area</b> than other tablet keyboard attachments, and for being usable after getting used to its soft feel. The Type Cover was recommended over the Touch Cover due to its higher quality and more conventional key design. Surface's display was praised for its larger size and widescreen aspect ratio over the iPad line, but panned for having [...] "muted" [...] color reproduction. While the touchscreen-oriented aspects of the Windows 8 interface were praised for being [...] "elegant", albeit harder to learn than Android or iOS, the Windows RT operating system was panned for still requiring use of the mouse-oriented desktop interface to access some applications and settings not accessible from within the [...] "Metro" [...] shell, and for its poor application ecosystem, with Windows Store's state on-launch compared to [...] "a ghost town after the apocalypse." [...] Surface was also panned for its poor performance, especially in comparison to other Tegra 3-based tablets. In conclusion, {{it was felt that}} [...] "paired with a keyboard cover, the Surface is an excellent Office productivity tool (the best in tablet form) and if your entertainment needs don't go far beyond movies, TV shows, music, and the occasional simple game, you're covered there as well", but that assuming Windows Store would eventually improve its application selection, [...] "both it and the Surface's wonky performance keep a useful productivity device from reaching true tablet greatness." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of ionic conduction through polymer coatings has been investigated. The presence of highly permeable {{areas in the}} coating (designated as D <b>type</b> <b>areas),</b> impose an electrochemical inhomogeneity which is identified by change in the ionic resistance as measured by DC method.
