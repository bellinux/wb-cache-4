Unfortunately, the film size and product throughput are limited by the current vacuum-based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition techniques. Solution-based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition could archive a continuous large area <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition of chalcogenides. Also by eliminating the vacuum requirement, the total process cost can be significantly reduced. Here three different routes to deposit the chalcogenide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> have been studied: from solution-based deposited metal oxide film, from electroplated metal <b>thin</b> <b>film,</b> and from bulk chalcogenide powder. By a hydrogen-assisted selenization process, an oxide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of copper, indium, and gallium has been successfully transited to CuIn₁₋ₓGaₓSe₂ chalcopyrite <b>thin</b> <b>film,</b> and the solar deviceshave been fabricated based on this p-type chalcogenide material.
