5000|$|Snyder {{wrote to}} Judge Van Sickle's {{secretary}} {{as she had}} suggested. In this letter, Snyder complained that the compensation provided under the CJA was inadequate, and protested that [...] "now, however, {{not only are we}} paid an amount of money which does not even cover our overhead, but we have to go through extreme gymnastics even to receive the puny amounts which the federal courts authorize for this work." [...] He said that he would not provide any additional paperwork to support his compensation request, and that [...] "you can take it or leave it." [...] Snyder closed his letter by stating: [...] "Further, I am extremely disgusted by the treatment of us by the Eighth Circuit in this case, and you are instructed to remove my name from the list of attorneys who will accept criminal indigent defense work. I have simply had it. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and attention." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dear Listener, Tracks 3 and 4 {{take place}} in the 40's; tracks 5 and 6 in the 20's and 30's; track 7 in the later 50's; track 8 starts in the very early 40's; track 9 goes back and forth; track 10 takes place in the early 60's; the final track takes place in the early 90's. Track 2 takes place a few years ago; track 1 took place when it was recorded. The action {{depicted}} in [...] "The Wayward Granddaughter" [...] and [...] "Slavin' Away" [...] does not include the character Olga Sarantos plays {{on the rest of the}} record. [...] "Slavin' Away" [...] imagines that character—the main character—fantasizing, a bit remotely, about the hard lot of other women. Now, I wouldn't guess that the Main Character actually thought the woman concerned was riding around in a Norton side-car and operating her own cottage industry trinket assembly/sweatshop: but it might have pleased her to picture it so. [...] "The Wayward Granddaughter" [...] is about a different Greek-American grandmother and her popular granddaughter ("Connie"). They're from Chicago's south suburbs and don't figure in the rest of the record; I wanted to have another (slightly younger) grandmother and family in there for perspective or comparison's sake, so to speak. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time,</b> Matthew Friedberger ...|$|E
