Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E

Dworsky was a four-year starter for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1948. He played linebacker, fullback, and center for the Michigan Wolverines and was a key player on the undefeated 1947 and 1948 Michigan football teams that won consecutive national championships.

Burnley won the game 10–1 with seven goals from Joe Anderson in addition to strikes from James Lindsay, Walter Weaver and Thomas Jackson. Burnley's opening game in the FA Cup was an away tie at Leicester City on 8 January 1921. Bob Kelly scored for the fourth game in succession and Joe Anderson scored four goals as Burnley won the match 7–3, {{the first time the}} team had scored seven goals in a competitive match away from home.

5|$|The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{was created}} on 15 May 1908 {{under the name}} Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LHG). In 1908, organized ice hockey was still relatively new; the first organized indoor ice hockey game took place on 3 March 1875 at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and the trustees decided to award it to either <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>team</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. The Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) was formed in 1905, which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters. The ECAHA eventually folded {{and as a result}} of the dissolution, the National Hockey Association (NHA) formed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} to regulate competitive ice hockey matches {{came in the}} late 1880s. Before then, teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal (the Montreals, the Crystals, the Victorias, and McGill University) and the Ottawa HC formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip Dansken Ross as its trustees; they chose to award it to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>team</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge.

5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>team</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
