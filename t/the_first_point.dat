5|$|<b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|These signs {{give us some}} of the {{terminology}} used today. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of Aries was named when the vernal equinox was actually in the constellation Aries; it has since moved into Pisces.|$|E
5|$|From Debian 5.0, the {{numbering}} scheme of point releases was changed, conforming to the GNU version numbering standard; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> release of Debian 5.0 was 5.0.1 instead of 5.0r1. The {{numbering scheme}} {{was once again}} changed for the first Debian 7 update, which was version 7.1. The r scheme {{is no longer in}} use, but point release announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs.|$|E

In the quarter-finals, he beat Peter Gade, thus helping to secure Malaysia's place in the semi-finals. In the semi-finals against China, Lee was defeated by Lin Dan, which ended his 18-match unbeaten record {{since the start of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Since its establishment, {{the mosque}} {{has been used}} to counsel future hajj participants. It also served as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of {{departure}} for hajj participants from Central Sumatra, who left Sumatra via Emma Haven after the port was opened in 1895. Before the end of the Padri War, in 1818 the Minang Ulamas held a meeting at Ganting to discuss the steps they would take to eliminate mysticism and superstition from Islam on the island.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island was not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs {{to a point of}} land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point,</b> that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|Pryce scored <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of {{his career}} in the 1974 German Grand Prix at the {{challenging}} Nürburgring circuit. After finishing 6th from 11th on the grid, he then qualified in 16th for the next Grand Prix in Austria, but spun off on lap 22, ending his race. He qualified in 22nd place for the Italian Grand Prix, and finished 12 places higher. His season ended miserably, with an engine failure in Canada, and the Shadow severely off the pace in Watkins Glen. At {{the end of the season}} Pryce was equal 18th in the Drivers' Championship with Graham Hill and Vittorio Brambilla.|$|E

5|$|Since no {{documents}} {{exist to}} confirm {{the content of the}} Mise of Lewes, there has been much debate among historians over its content, and the circumstances under which it was written. Noël Denholm-Young, in an article published in 1933, made a conjecture on what the main points of the agreement were. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>point,</b> according to Denholm-Young, was that Prince Edward and his cousin, Henry of Almain, should be given over to the barons as hostages. Secondly, those of the baronial party who had been taken hostage at Northampton were to be released. Thirdly, those who had taken hostages from the royalist party at the Battle of Lewes were to receive ransom. Finally, it was agreed that a committee of French clergy and nobles should arbitrate over a permanent settlement. This interpretation has been largely followed by later historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} checklist {{was started}} at 20:27:01, {{at which time}} the aircraft's altitude reached 500meters (1,500ft). <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> on the checklist were not readable, but the last three were. At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems {{which could be used}} if the landing gear did not deploy properly. At this point the aircraft started the descent from 500meters (1,500ft).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who {{were reported}} missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} PvP modes in Vainglory: Standard, {{in which the}} whole map is available, Battle Royale, in which {{progression}} is faster and the battle is limited only to the lane, and Blitz, in which players must gain the most number of points or reach the 15 point score cap in 5 minutes by taking down turrets and killing off Crystal Sentries or the Gold Miner which gives three points each, or by killing other players which gives one point. If a Blitz match were to ever be tied by the 5 minute mark, then {{the first team to}} score <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> in overtime wins. Players can play ranked Standard games to increase their in-game ranking, or casual Standard games, in which their rank is not affected. In the game client, ranked play duration is listed as 25 minutes, whereas casual play is 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, Hansen {{was called}} {{up by the}} Canucks. He became the first born-and-raised Danish player to compete and {{register}} {{a point in the}} NHL post-season — Frans Nielsen had played and scored <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> by a born-and-raised Dane in the regular season earlier that year. The point was scored in Game 3 of the first round against the Dallas Stars by assisting on a goal by Jan Bulis. The Canucks advanced past the Stars in seven games to meet the Anaheim Ducks in the second round. In Game 5 of the series, with the Canucks facing elimination in overtime, Hansen played an instrumental part on the ice when the Ducks scored. Attempting to carry the puck out of the defensive zone, he was hit to the ice by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. While Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo had his arm up {{in the direction of the}} referee, protesting the lack of penalty, the puck came loose to Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer, who scored past the distracted Luongo. Following the Canucks' elimination, Hansen was sent back to the Moose for their 2007 Calder Cup playoffs. Back in the AHL, he was pointless in six games as the Moose were defeated by the Hamilton Bulldogs in the second round.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, {{relief work}} helped keep the women's {{societies}} in Wales active, though membership numbers began to fall. After the People's act of 1918, {{many of the}} regional branches began to wither. The Llangollen WSS resolved to disband in December 1918, handing their marching banner to the National Council, believing their work was done. While others, such as the Newport branch, revised their aims to form a Women's Citizen Association taking an active interest in welfare and social issues. Other branches continued the political vision of equal suffrage, notably Bangor, while the Cardiff WSS busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts. The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of order was the bill to admit women as MPs. This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election. There was one female candidacy in Wales, Millicent Mackenzie, a former professor of education from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat. It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP, Megan Lloyd George, the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>point</b> and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be {{in front of the other}} flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.|$|E

This is one of the two points in the sky where the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic (the other being <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> of Aries, now in the constellation of Pisces.) This point will pass into the neighbouring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.|$|E
