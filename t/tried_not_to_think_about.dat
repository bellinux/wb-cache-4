5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E

[...] "Black Pussy doesn't worry me, but I must confess that if there is any one I fear, it is Yowler the Bob Cat. Just {{thinking}} about him make me nervous. The more I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him, the more I did think about him, and the more I thought about him, the more nervous I got. Then just before dark, {{on the bank of the}} Laughing Brook, I found some tracks in the mud. Those tracks were almost round, and that fact was enough to tell me who had made them. They were Yowler's footprints, and they hadn't been made very long.|$|E

I've been for easy-going all my life. But I'm that worried and afraid, with death and ruin threatened and evil all about me! I don't know what to do! My own sister's son, and me a widow woman and 'elpless against his doin's!" ...|$|R
60|$|On this, Dickory's heart fell further. He {{had been}} troubled about the Scotchman, but had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him.|$|R
60|$|Marjorie {{would have}} {{preferred}} that Mr. Magnet should not have decided with such relentless determination to make his second proposal on the church tower. His purpose was luminously clear {{to her from the}} beginning of lunch onward, and she could feel her nerves going under the strain of that long expectation. She tried to pull herself together, <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, tried to be amused by the high spirits and nonsense of Mr. Wintersloan and Syd and Rom and Theodore; but Mr. Magnet was very pervasive, and her mother didn't ever look at her, looked past her and away from her and all round her, in a profoundly observant manner. Marjorie felt chiefly anxious {{to get to the top}} of that predestinate tower and have the whole thing over, and it was with a start that she was just able to prevent one of the assiduous waiters filling her glass with champagne for the third time.|$|E
60|$|When {{the next}} day came she began to be sorely troubled in her mind; or rather the trouble which had been in it ever since her return from Kingston, and which she had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> had to be faced, and it looked {{somewhat}} formidable. For she had not yet seen Mary, {{in spite of her}} promise made at their last parting to go to her immediately on her return from Kingston. But much had happened since their parting: she had met and had become friendly with the man that Mary hated with a great hatred; and she feared that when she came to relate these things, which would have to be related, there would be a storm. But she could no longer delay to encounter it, and Fan knew, better than most perhaps, how to bow her head and escape harm; and so, putting a bold face on it-- though it was not a very bold face--she got into a cab about noon and had herself driven to Dawson Place.|$|E
50|$|Reflecting back on {{his career}} and its three knee surgeries, Sampson {{admitted}} that he had attempted to come back too quickly from them, and said that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what could have been.|$|E

5000|$|The season {{did not end}} on such a {{high note}} though. After {{receiving}} a bye to {{the quarterfinals of the}} SEC Tournament, Kentucky lost that game to Vanderbilt. Showing a great deal of emotion, Harrow blamed himself while fighting tears in post game interviews. Kentucky was later eliminated by Robert Morris in the NIT’s opening round. Two weeks later, Harrow announced that he would be transferring universities to be with his father. “I really <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it until the season was all the way over,” Harrow said. “It was a hard decision because I knew how good Kentucky was going to be this season.” Ryan's father was his only family member still living in Atlanta, and he felt like he needed to be there with him. “We have a saying in my family, ‘Family First’,” Harrow said. “We’ve all got that tattooed on us. My dad is the only one in Atlanta, and with the struggles that he's going through, I just thought that it would be best for me to come back and help him with whatever he needed.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Rindt {{was content}} to {{maintain}} his cushion over Courage and Brabham, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> all the times he had led before and not won. On lap 88, Hill spun off the track {{on a patch of}} oil and stalled. He unfastened his straps, {{got out of the car}} and push-started it, but could not refasten his belts alone. His off-track excursion had apparently punctured a rear tire, and he signaled the pit to get ready to change it. Before he made it back around, however, the tire exploded at the end of the straight and sent the Lotus cartwheeling into an embankment. Hill was thrown from the car and suffered broken bones in both legs. Later, at the hospital, he was asked by team members if he had a message to pass along to his wife. Hill replied, [...] "Just tell her that I won't be dancing for two weeks." [...] Hill's accident was witnessed by two fifteen-year-old boys from nearby Montrose, Pennsylvania, John Moore and Kevin Hibbard. Their eyewitness account stated that [...] "It looked like the crash was unsurvivable. We thought he had definitely been killed." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Epifano was a {{freshman}} at Amherst College majoring in African Art history. During her freshman year, she told NPR that she was invited to watch a movie by an acquaintance and fell asleep during the movie (she reported {{she had not been}} drinking). When she awoke, she reported that the acquaintance was sexually assaulting her; the next morning she left and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the assault. Her alleged assailant was never legally prosecuted or sanctioned by Amherst college. [...] Nine months later she went to one of Amherst College's sexual assault guidance counselors. [...] After some time and after seeing a second guidance counselor, she admitted to thinking about suicide and was forcibly admitted by Amherst College into a psychiatric ward for five days. She returned to school just {{before the end of the}} spring semester after she placed a restraining order on the person she alleged committed the assault. [...] She subsequently dropped out of Amherst College and started working on a dude ranch in Wyoming during the fall of 2012. It was during this time that she became frustrated that she had left Amherst College without attempting to improve the support system for victims of sexual assault. [...] She decided to do something about it by writing an essay on her experiences of the assault, with other students, and with sexual assault support system at Amherst College.|$|E

He had exhausted the fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had passed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every aspect, exhausted every possibility. It had become a theoretical possibility, the basis of continually less confident, continually more unsubstantial day dreams. Constantly he had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>tried</b> to assure himself of Sir Isaac's invalid immortality. And here it was! ...|$|R
