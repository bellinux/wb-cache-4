5|$|Prem and Poonam {{go through}} the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from {{different}} sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both {{realize the importance of}} the engagement rings that they have given to each other and the special right that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
25|$|Major gaps {{remain in}} the {{implementation}} of the rehabilitation measures, with villagers alleging that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> little of the rehabilitation package they were promised. The negative economic impact of the displacement to villagers from Kuno sanctuary has raised a controversy over the merits of species preservation via dislocation of human populations living inside Protected Areas. NGOs, such as the Samrakshan Trust, have been working for better rehabilitation of villagers who agreed {{to move out of the}} Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
500|$|James Tomison, {{who became}} a keeper in 1861, wrote of the bird migrations visible from the tower: [...] "Hundreds of birds are flying about in all directions, {{crossing}} and re-crossing one another's flight, but never coming into collision, all seemingly {{of the opinion that}} the only way of escape out of the confusion into which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> is through the windows of the lantern". A fog bell had been installed by then, one of only two operating in Scotland at the time.|$|E

500|$|After the Second World War Allingham {{continued}} to work for Ford until he retired in 1960. After Denis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association tracked him down in 2001, Allingham took {{a prominent role in}} telling his story so that later generations would not forget. On 16 October 2003, he helped launch [...] the 2003 Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal with model Nell McAndrew aboard the cruiser [...] He was quoted as saying [...] " [...] have given all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> for the country ...

[...] Cambridge's president David Cassidy (who would row for Goldie) was blunt in his assessment: [...] "A powerful car will beat a less powerful car." [...] Cambridge, coached by Robin Williams, suffered a setback: their number five, Toby Wallace, was ill in the run-in to the race, and {{did not participate in}} the outings just prior to the main event. [...] Despite that, The Times reported that the Light Blue boat looked [...] "ominously powerful".|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E

500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{appearance}} by Little River Band, scheduled for 12 January 2015 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, was cancelled after complaints from earlier members concerning its promotion as a 40th anniversary performance. Permission for any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused. “We’ve just {{had enough of}} it,” Original Lead singer Glenn Shorrock said. “They’ve been living off our coat-tails for years.” [...] "They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got.</b> They should do that rather than pretend they are the band that sold 30 million albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. You {{have no idea how}} difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a story that is possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E
