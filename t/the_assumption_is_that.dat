25|$|The bill tip organ is {{a region}} found near {{the tip of}} the bill in several types of birds that forage {{particularly}} by probing. The region has a high density of nerve endings known as the corpuscles of Herbst. This consists of pits in the bill surface which in the living bird is occupied by cells that sense pressure changes. <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this allows the bird to perform 'remote touch', which means that it can detect movements of animals which the bird does not directly touch. Bird species known to have a 'bill-tip organ' includes members of ibisis, shorebirds of the family Scolopacidae, and kiwis.|$|E
40|$|This article argues <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> several <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> {{guide and}} shape {{the issues of}} {{decentralisation}} and partnership in creating a responsible and citizen-focused public service in South Africa, in developed countries and in other developing countries. <b>The</b> first <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> decentralisation as a normative ideal ought to be pursued everywhere. <b>The</b> second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> public administrators simply need to make decentralisation work for the citizenry and not question it at all. <b>The</b> third <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> decentralisation can work because centralisation has not. <b>The</b> fourth <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if decentralisation <b>is</b> not working {{in the interests of}} the citizenry the fault lies elsewhere than with decentralisation itself – the corollary of this is to <b>be</b> found in <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> where two public administrators simply need to find ways of making it work {{in the interests of the}} citizenry.

25|$|In Monte Carlo, {{an initial}} {{configuration}} is refined by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected {{based on their}} induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until {{a certain number of}} steps have been tried. <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move.|$|E

It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor.

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". <b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio.
