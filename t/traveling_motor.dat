40|$|Sedentary {{behaviors}} {{are associated with}} less physical activity. Little evidence exists about this association and its relation with commuting time in Latin America. This study examined the association between time spent <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles and physical activity levels in the domains of leisure time physical activity and transportation, among Colombian adults in urban areas. A secondary data analysis of the 2010 National Nutrition Survey was conducted. Time spent <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles and physical activity were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Binary logistic regressions were conducted. Time spent <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles for 120 minutes or more was reported among 27. 6 % of the sample. The prevalence of walking and bicycling {{as a means of}} transportation for at least 150 minutes per week was 34 % and 4. 4 %, respectively. Achieving at least 150 minutes of leisure time physical activity a week was reported by 18. 4 % of the sample. This study suggests negative associations between time spent <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles and active transport, with significant trend associations in stratified analyses. No significant associations were found between time spent <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles and leisure time physical activity...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), its various applications are attracting more and more attention. Among MEMS, micro motors, electrostatic and electromagnetic, are the typical and important ones. As an alternative approach, the piezoelectric <b>traveling</b> wave micro <b>motor,</b> based on thin film material and integrated circuit technologies, circumvents many of the drawbacks of the above mentioned two types of motors and displays distinct advantages. In this paper we report on a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) piezoelectric thin film <b>traveling</b> wave <b>motor.</b> The PZT film with a thickness of 150 micrometers and a diameter of 8 mm was first deposited onto a metal substrate as the stator material. Then, eight sections were patterned to form the stator electrodes. The rotor had an 8 kHz frequency power supply. The rotation speed of the motor is 100 rpm. The relationship of the friction between the stator and the rotor {{and the structure of}} the rotor on rotation were also studied...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Ultrasonic motors {{are a good}} {{alternative}} to electromagnetic motors in medical robotics, since they are electromagnetically compatible. Estimating speed instead of using encoders reduces cost and dimension of the robot {{on the one hand}} and increases reliability on the other hand. However, no sensorless speed controller is yet industrialized. Analytical models of the <b>traveling</b> wave ultrasonic <b>motor</b> being too complex to be exploited for sensorless control purpose, we suggest speed estimation based on artificial neural networks. The artificial neural network is designed based on a sensitivity analysis using design of experiments methods. Factorial designs have been chosen to find out the effects of each input factor, but also the effect of their interactions. First results show that speed estimation using artificial neural networks is a promising approach. The artificial neural network optimized with design of experiments methods is a valid model of the <b>traveling</b> wave ultrasonic <b>motor</b> to estimate speed. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic motors {{have many}} {{excellent}} performance {{features such as}} high-holding torque, high driving torque at low speed, silent operation, compactness, and no electromagnetic interferences. Due to such characteristics these motors have a potential for many applications such as automation, and robotics. The performance estimation of the ultrasonic motor {{is a function of}} operating conditions such as stiffness, number of piezoelectric segments, motor diameter, etc. Such performance is modeled using the accurate parameters of the motor. In this paper, the derivation of a mathematical model for <b>traveling</b> wave ultrasonic <b>motors</b> and its experimental validation is presented. The different components of the motor have been modeled individually. The resulting submodels are then assembled together to give the model of the complete motor. In order to validate the model, it is simulated with properly parameters and compared with experimental results obtained from an actual <b>traveling</b> wave ultrasonic <b>motor</b> "Shinsei USR 60 ". Good agreement is obtained between simulated and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Many {{wheelchair}} users <b>traveling</b> in <b>motor</b> {{vehicles are}} required to or choose to remain seated in their wheelchairs. Studies have shown that casters are particularly prone to failure, if the vehicle {{were involved in a}} frontal impact. This study evaluates the use of incorporating energy absorption into the wheelchair casters to improve wheelchair-occupant kinematics. A parametric sensitivity analysis conducted using a previously validated computer crash model suggested that caster stiffnesses between 1750 lb/in and 750 lbs/in along with R and G factors between 0 - 0. 5 and 0. 75 - 1, respectively can improve wheelchair-occupant kinematics by dissipating the crash energy. Such an approach may present opportunities to reduce wheelchair-seated occupant injury risk in a motor vehicle crash...|$|R
