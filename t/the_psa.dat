5|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first two {{requirements}} had been satisfied, and that the guideline had not been rigidly enforced because <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> {{had been willing to}} consider representations from cruise operators like the plaintiff, and, if the circumstances required, <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had been willing to grant an exception to the 30% restriction rule. Moreover, a number of concessions had in fact been made by <b>the</b> <b>PSA.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the facts}} of Lines International, the judge held that the policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E
5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on the facts of the case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> alone.|$|E

Based on the Peugeot 104, {{it was the only}} Talbot not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot to be launched, and the last in production. Its demise in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door hatchback, it was also for some time the only small car available in a factory-ordered cabrio body style, and the most economical car in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee set up by <b>the</b> <b>PSA,</b> STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held {{that there was nothing}} unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E
40|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation (DIC) is {{the most}} common complication of solid tumours. In this study, the effectiveness of three polysaccharide anticoagulants (PSAs), at therapeutic doses, at inhibiting solid tumour growth was investigated. Mice with tumour xenografts were subcutaneously injected with either unfractionated heparin (UFH; 200 [*]units[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1), dalteparin (75 [*]units[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1) or danaparoid (50 [*]units[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1). At these concentrations, these PSAs are equieffective at inhibiting blood coagulation activated factor X. In mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumours dalteparin and, to a lesser extent, UFH inhibited both tumour growth and angiogenesis, whereas danaparoid did not. In contrast, in mice with KLN 205 tumours, all <b>the</b> <b>PSAs</b> inhibited tumour growth and angiogenesis. All <b>the</b> <b>PSAs</b> significantly inhibited proliferation, migration of endothelial cells and vessel formation in matrigel plugs containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and {{there were no significant differences}} between these effects of <b>the</b> <b>PSAs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>PSAs</b> had no effect on endothelial cell tubular formation in vitro. Although all <b>the</b> <b>PSAs</b> inhibited VEGF production in KLN 205 tumours in vivo and cells in vitro, in LLC tumours and cells only UFH and dalteparin inhibited VEGF production, whereas danaparoid did not. In both LLC and KLN 205 tumours in vivo, heparanase activity was inhibited by UFH and dalteparin, but not by danaparoid. Hence, UFH and dalteparin may be more effective than danaparoid at inhibiting cancer progression in DIC patients with solid tumours, due at least in part to their ability to suppress VEGF and heparanase in tumours...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{process was}} {{developed}} to remove metallic anions from dilute aqueous solutions using polymer-surfactant aggregates (PSAs). This process uses a cationic surfactant to form micelle-like aggregates on oppositely charged polymer chains, thus forming <b>PSAs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>PSAs</b> can bind with dilute anions and self-flocculate. Subsequently, <b>the</b> anion-loaded <b>PSA</b> flocculates can {{be separated from the}} solution by gravity settling. The concentration of chemical residue, however, is relatively high in the treated water. To improve the quality of treated water and reduce the chemical usage, two different surfactants containing a 16 -carbon chain have been investigated individually. The results show that an extended chain surfactant can decrease the concentration of chromate after treatment from 7 ppm (0. 06 mM) to 0. 5 ppm (0. 004 mM) and the concentration of residual surfactant from 1 mM to 0. 02 mM, using the same polymer. <b>The</b> <b>PSAs</b> formed with an extended chain surfactant work effectively at a salinity below 300 mM KCl and a temperature below 50 °C. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>PSAs</b> formed with a longer chain surfactant enhance the effectiveness of treating dilute metallic anions, {{and at the same time}} lead to much less surfactant residue in the treated water. Such a PSA process has potential application in the efficient removal of dilute metallic anions during process aqueous effluent treatment...|$|R
