500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch {{and a pair of}} glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E
2500|$|The print {{depicts the}} {{character}} Satake Shinjūrō {{in a dramatic}} standing pose. His appearance {{is that of a}} samurai, his hair styled in a [...] topknot, his feet bare. Her wears a short, bright red kimono decorated with thin white vertical stripes. Over this, he wears a simple grey [...] jacket whose only decoration is a flower motif [...] family crest, which may be a plum blossom variant. His arms have been removed from <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> haori which hang down at his sides, and he has a sageo string holding back the long sleeves of his kimono. Both of these are intended to increase his mobility, particularly in combat.|$|E

2500|$|On {{creating}} individuality for {{the passengers}} {{in the tail}} section, George had the designs come from random materials they would use to fashion practical clothing, [...] "The tail section clothing was pieced together from different garments and repairs were made on top of that. They had to improvise with any materials that were left on the train." [...] For the design of Curtis, Bong and George {{wanted him to be}} anonymous {{but at the same time}} recognizable. The design was difficult as George had to conceal Evans' muscular physique and muscle mass thus, [...] "We had to cut out <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> under layers to help him look leaner." ...|$|E
2500|$|William H. Rehnquist, former Chief Justice of the United States, {{was a great}} Gilbert and Sullivan fan and was {{inspired}} by the costume of the Lord Chancellor, in a production of Iolanthe, to add four golden stripes to <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> judicial robes. The next Chief Justice, John G. Roberts Jr., did not retain the ornamentation. [...] In 1980, while an Associate Justice, Rehnquist mentioned the Lord Chancellor in his dissenting opinion in the case of Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, comparing the majority opinion to the hubris of the Lord Chancellor: The Law is the true embodiment/Of everything that's excellent./It has no kind of fault or flaw/And I, My Lords, embody the Law.|$|E

60|$|O'Grady {{was sitting}} up {{with his back to}} the wall; <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket and shirt had been cut off, and a {{tourniquet}} was on his arm just above the elbow.|$|E
60|$|Bianca saw her father's fragile arms {{stretch out}} into the night through <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> white garment, as though expecting to be {{received}} at once into the Universal Brotherhood of the thin air.|$|E
60|$|The {{operations}} that followed were singularly unpleasant, and Frank felt {{a good deal}} less enthusiastic about hunting when he washed his hands and <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket in the creek after they were over.|$|E

60|$|The {{young man}} slowly rubbed the stock <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rifle with <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, and {{looked as if}} he {{understood}} and sympathised with his friend's chagrin.|$|R
60|$|Inga {{said nothing}} and {{appeared}} {{not to notice}} the King's failure. So now Rinkitink, with a serious look on his fat, red face, took off his purple robe and rolled up <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tunic and tried again.|$|E
60|$|When Charnock stopped, a {{man without}} a coat and with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine white shirt rolled up came out. He as rather an old man and his {{movements}} were slack; his face was hard, {{but on the whole}} expressionless.|$|E
60|$|Newman Noggs was {{the sole}} actor. He stood at a little {{distance}} from the door, with his face towards it; and with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat turned back at the wrists, was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous, scientific, and straightforward blows upon the empty air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take me and welcome," [...] Yuill cried, mistaking Gavin for the enemy. He {{had only}} one arm through <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, and his feet were bare.|$|R

60|$|Sometimes, of an evening, when Janet {{was helping}} Mrs. Maturin in her {{planting}} or weeding, Insall would join them, rolling up <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flannel shirt and kneeling beside {{them in the}} garden paths. Mrs. Maturin was forever asking his advice, though she did not always follow it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wow! {{but that}} snow is cold!" [...] cried Andy, {{who had gotten}} some down <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sweater. [...] "Stop! Don't bury me! I'll be good!" [...] And then he {{scrambled}} to his feet once more, while Fred did the same. Then the whole party proceeded on its way.|$|E
60|$|Jacob {{struck his}} bell, and Dauncey {{came in with}} a very grim look upon his face. Mr. Dane Montague caught up his hat and plucked at <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|R

6000|$|...

60|$|He {{gathered}} {{a handful of}} snow, made it into a ball, {{and held it in}} his hands until the cold pained him, then he dropped the snow and thrust his hands up <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doublet. Paolo looked on in astonishment, but having great faith in his master imitated his example.|$|E
60|$|When he had got {{his hands}} free by pulling <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old coat off inside out, {{he used his}} hands to pull the last of it over his head. Then he gulped very hard {{two or three times}} to swallow his old suit, and when the last of it had disappeared, he found his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "It were {{shame and}} sin both," [...] said Peter, a good natured Fleming, {{notwithstanding}} all his self conceit, {{and as he}} spoke he wiped <b>his</b> eyes with <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jerkin.|$|R
