CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>up</b> and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E

25|$|One {{variation}} on the normal anatomy of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to five metres longer than normal. This condition, referred to as redundant colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. A significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult {{and in some cases}} impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming this problem.|$|E

25|$|The nests of N. corniger {{are dark}} brown {{on the surface}} and have small bumps over their exterior.

25|$|Opium poppy {{contains}} {{at least}} 50 different alkaloids, {{but most of}} them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes roughly 8–19% of opium by dry weight (depending on growing conditions). Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to 26% morphine by weight. A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried poppy straw is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15. The Norman strain of P. Somniferum, also developed in Tasmania, produces down to 0.04% morphine but with much higher amounts of thebaine and oripavine, which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.|$|E

500|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus, {{commonly}} known as the northern bearded milkcap, the northern milkcap, or the purple-staining milkcap, is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family.

Distinguishing features of its fruit body include the large orange-yellow cap up to [...] wide, cream to pale yellow gills, and a yellow coarsely-pitted stem <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to [...] long and [...] thick. Cut fruit bodies ooze a white latex that will stain mushroom tissue lilac to purple.

L.repraesentaneus is poisonous, and consumption causes stomach aches.|$|E

Considered {{to be one of the}} best edible mushrooms {{of the genus}} Russula, it is especially popular in Spain and China. With a taste that is described variously as mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet, it is cooked by grilling, frying, sautéeing, or eaten raw.

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} G.rufa are {{initially}} closed and roughly spherical to top-shaped, and resemble minute puffballs.

The interior surface of the cup, which bears the spore-bearing surface (the hymenium) is reddish-brown to orange-brown. The exterior surface is blackish-brown, and covered with hairs that measure 7–8μm long that give it a felt-like or hairy texture. The flesh of the fruit body lacks any distinctive taste or odor, and is grayish, translucent, gelatinous and rubbery. The fungus sometimes has a short stem <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to [...] long by [...] wide, but it may be missing in some specimens. Dried fruit bodies become leathery and wrinkled.|$|E
