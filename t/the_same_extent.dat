Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extent</b> as the country's larger political parties.

5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture.

There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester.

The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E

Neither A 23187 nor thrombin induced the production of a catalytic fragment of protein kinase C which might be generated by limited proteolysis with Ca 2 +-dependent protease. These results indicate that A 23187 induces protein kinase C activation which phosphorylates the 40 kDa protein, but higher doses of A 23187 are required for the activation of this enzyme than for the activation of MLC kinase...|$|R

40|$|Interpersonal {{movement}} coordination {{is characterized}} by stable coordination patterns. We examined {{the extent to which}} the two individuals within a dyad contributed to the stabilization of a shared coordination pattern. Within each dyad, the two participants coordinated rhythmic movements of their right lower arms in either in-phase or antiphase. We analyzed the responses to precisely controlled mechanical perturbations to one of the arms that disrupted the coordination pattern. Return to the original coordination pattern did not only involve phase adaptations in the perturbed arm, but in the unperturbed arm as well. Hence, the coupling between the companions was bidirectional and subserved the coordinative stability. Moreover, for both coordination patterns the interpersonal coupling was near symmetrical, with both actors (perturbed and unperturbed) contributing to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extents</b> to <b>the</b> restabilization of the coordination between them. The applied methodology provides a new entry point to examine asymmetries in interpersonal coupling, due to, for instance, social impairments, differences in social competence, or particular task setting.

5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, but not to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extent.</b> The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause {{a significant increase in}} cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a liking. The Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown {{on a number of occasions}} for the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi-sectional painting, though not to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extent</b> as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio, en plein air. It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season.

Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value.

40|$|Under {{anaerobic}} atmosphere {{where the}} gas phase was simply replaced by N 2, photo-inhibition of PS I of isolated spinach chloroplasts was insignificant. However, when dithionite {{was included in}} the irradiation mixture, severe photoinhibition of the NADP+ and the MV photo-reduction occurred. Neither P 700 determined by continuous illumination-induced difference spectroscopy, Fe-S centers determined by EPR under cryogenic temperatures, nor vitamin K-l determined by HPLC analysis were significantly decreased under these photoinhibition condi-tions. Although photobleaching of antenna chlorophylls occurred to more or less extent, NADP+ photoreduction activities were markedly depressed even under saturating actinic light. The maximal amplitude of the flash induced absorbance changes of P 700 in ms range decreased almost in parallel with the loss of NADP+ photoreduction activity. These results indicate that although the Fe-S centers of the photoinhibited chloroplasts were reducible by continuous il-lumination, to almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extents</b> as that of the control chloroplasts, the efficiency of reduc-tion by each flash was much lower than that of the control chloroplasts.

40|$|The {{fixation}} {{procedures in}} sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay for human leukemia cells were modified {{to produce more}} reliable results. It {{was found that the}} concentration of the fixative agent, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), was critical in the selective fixation of cellular protein. While a TCA solution of 80 % fixed both cells and serum proteins, a 50 % solution fixed only cells with a very low interference of the serum proteins. Accordingly, we selected 50 % TCA as a fixative agent which made the final absorbance of the SRB assay to be exactly matched to the cell density with a small deviation and a low background. Besides the change of TCA concentration, a precentifugation of microplate just before fixation also improved the previous assay procedures in the two points of view. The 2 -h standing step was simply substituted for only 1 min of centrifugation. Both the rapid and slow application of TCA solution in fixation produced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>extents</b> of fixation.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the molecular mechanisms of red-green color vision in mammals, we have cloned and sequenced {{the red and}} green opsin cDNAs of cat (Felis catus), horse (Equus caballus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). These opsins were expressed in COS 1 cells and reconstituted with 11 -cis-retinal. The purified visual pigments of the cat, horse, squirrel, deer, and guinea pig have lambdamax values at 553, 545, 532, 531, and 516 nm, respectively, which are precise to within +/- 1 nm. We also regenerated the "true" red pigment of goldfish (Carassius auratus), which has a lambdamax value at 559 +/- 4 nm.
