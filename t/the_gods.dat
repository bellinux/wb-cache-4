5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b>|$|E
5|$|American Indian lore {{contains}} numerous legends {{to explain}} the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous {{of these is the}} Bridge of <b>the</b> <b>Gods</b> legend told by the Klickitat people.

5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} to aid <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> in the god-demon war, when <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess {{cut off her}} own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E

Odin will ride to the well Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. <b>The</b> <b>gods</b> and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, will ride in the front.|$|E

50|$|Over 170 {{names are}} {{recorded}} for <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Odin (see List of names of Odin). These names are variously descriptive of attributes of <b>the</b> <b>god,</b> refer to myths involving him, or refer to religious practices associated with <b>the</b> <b>god.</b> This multitude of names makes Odin <b>the</b> <b>god</b> with <b>the</b> most names known among the Germanic peoples.|$|R
5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E
5|$|Hera– Zeus' jaded {{wife and}} former Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Gods.</b> In Betrayal, Hera's giant pet Argos {{was sent by}} <b>the</b> <b>Gods</b> to stop Kratos' rampage across Greece. In God of War III, the drunken goddess ordered the demigod Hercules to kill Kratos, but Kratos killed Hercules. When {{encountered}} in her gardens, a drunken Hera insulted Pandora, resulting in Kratos killing her, which ended all plant life. The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in God of War III.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Tara is {{addressed}} by Vali as {{the daughter of}} the vanara physician Sushena. Sometimes, verses are added in the Bala Kanda, the first book of the Ramayana, which describe principal monkeys created by various deities: Vali and Sugriva are described as sons of the king of <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> Indra and the sun-god Surya respectively; while Tara is described {{as the daughter of}} Brihaspati, the guru of <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b> The 12th century Tamil Ramavataram and the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayanam state that Tara and Ruma rose, along with other apsaras, from the ocean of milk during its churning by <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and the demons, to acquire the elixir of life (amrita). In the Theyyam drama tradition of Kerala, <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> tire and request Vali to help in the churning. When Vali just starts churning, Tara rises from the ocean and thus is gifted to Vali.|$|E
5|$|Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, {{and uses}} {{its power to}} become godlike. Despite Ares' best efforts to destroy Kratos {{physically}} and mentally, including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of <b>the</b> <b>Gods.</b> Athens is saved, and although Athena tells Kratos his sins are forgiven, <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> refuse to rid him of his nightmares. Forsaken by <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> she provides Kratos with {{a new set of}} blades and the seat as the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> is mostly drawn from religious writings {{produced by the}} nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and their nature.|$|E

5000|$|The magic papyri {{reflect the}} same ideas as the Abrasax-gems and often bear Hebraic names of <b>God.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} example is illustrative: [...] "I conjure you by Iaō Sabaōth Adōnai Abrasax, and by <b>the</b> great <b>god,</b> Iaeō". <b>The</b> patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities; for which fact many instances may be adduced. In the group [...] "Iakoubia, Iaōsabaōth Adōnai Abrasax," [...] {{the first name}} seems to be composed of Jacob and Ya. Similarly, entities considered angels in Judaism are invoked as gods alongside Abrasax: thus [...] "I conjure you... by <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Michaēl, by <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Souriēl, by <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Gabriēl, by <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Raphaēl, by <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Abrasax Ablathanalba Akrammachari...".|$|R

5|$|The text is a royal {{building}} inscription, a genre {{which had}} no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon. Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing {{the welfare of the}} people; the sanctuaries of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> are rebuilt or restored, offerings to <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> are made or increased and the blessings of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.|$|E

5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture.

Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. <b>The</b> <b>gods</b> dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E
