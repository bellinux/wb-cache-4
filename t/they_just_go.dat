It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of [...] "realism." [...] In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes [...] " [...] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." [...] Furthermore, [...] "I wanted to show in Hi, Mom! how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, [...] "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." [...] It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] section of Hi, Mom! is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done." ...|$|E

We know them all, and which whistles if we are in the way, and which will give way for us, and which will come right on without minding whether they run us down or not. The colliers are the worst for that; <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> straight on, and expect you {{to get out of the}} way, and don't mind a rap about the rule of the road or anything else.

How can you expect a man to have any muscle to speak of when he never does a stroke of hard work? I don’t say they don’t fight well, for I own they do their duty like men in that line; {{but when it comes to}} work, why, they ain’t in it with a jack-tar.

50|$|Hill {{reflected}} in 2016:I {{love the fact}} that people still enjoy something I did what, 37 years ago? It makes an old man happy. I'm surprised by it. But I loved working with my cameraman Andy Laszlo in shooting it, and I loved working with my cast, who were incredibly trusting of this crazy old fucker that was making the movie.

It ain't one river or it ain't another river as does it; every little stream from the hills cuts itself its cañon and makes its way along till it meets two or three others, then they go on together, cutting deeper and deeper until they run into one of the arms of the Green River or the Colorado or the Grand.|$|E

You can kill them, but you can't keep them from biting and foaming. Or they'll go straight stubborn. They're the worst. They're the passive resisters--that's what I call them. They won't fight back.
