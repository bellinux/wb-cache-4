Reflexive structuralist filmmaking, with its rejection of narrative, {{is not the}} only game in town.

Leslie and Sarah represent many things, including a literal depiction of evolution and progress and an ideal of a relationship that works in stark contrast to Nancy and Charlie's relationship.|$|E
25|$|Wilder wrote Our Town, {{a popular}} play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was {{inspired}} by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of Americans, and many elements of Stein's modernist style {{can be found in}} the play. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> <b>the</b> human experience. Wilder played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

500|$|Film {{composer}} Jerry Goldsmith scored First Contact, {{his third}} Star Trek feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with Alexander Courage's classic Star Trek fanfare. Instead of composing a menacing theme <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> <b>the</b> Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's [...] score, {{which is used}} in First Contact as a friendship theme and general thematic link. A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous Star Trek scores, including his theme from The Motion Picture. The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.|$|E

Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission {{as a way of}} helping ordinary Christians [...] "to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization...

[...] To support the series' unreliable narrative, Russo tried to write music that would push the audience [...] "off balance", which included [...] "a lot of dissonance, and a lot of key changes that are subtle so you don’t really recognize that it’s a key change. I go from playing with a synthesizer, and then I morph that into playing the same piece of music with the orchestra, but in an adjusted key." [...] Russo also looked to a variety of instruments and sounds for the show, such as orchestral and quartet effects that he called [...] "left of center"; violin bows on bed springs and other metal objects; a solo harpsichord for the finale's opening sequence; and an electronic version of Maurice Ravel's [...] "Boléro" [...] for [...] "Chapter 7" [...] that was merged with a classical recording of the piece to create what Russo referred to as [...] "Fauxlero".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark called Williams' a [...] "sometimes overly {{transparent}} effort <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> <b>the</b> grief of the victims' survivors", {{and said}} the episode [...] "works overtime" [...] {{to make the world}} seem like a [...] "bleak and scary place". Bark also said the show made itself a [...] "target for charges of racism" [...] by making the three murderers black, but also credited the script with making one of the perpetrators so sympathetic. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said the writers [...] "try a little too hard" [...] to create sympathy for the three murder suspects, and the episode suffers due to the absence of actor Andre Braugher, who plays Detective Frank Pembleton. But Shales also praised Williams' performance {{and said the}} episode was particularly powerful because the actual violence is off-screen. Buzz McCain, columnist with The Washington Times, called the episode [...] "irritating" [...] and [...] "as pointless as the killing". He particularly criticized the script, which he said was clichéd and overly [...] "misty-eyed", particularly the extended moments of Williams talking about the shooting. In a later article, McCain said, [...] "Nothing I've written in this column generated as much visceral response as my nine paragraphs about ("Bop Gun")." [...] In addition to responses from angry fans, McCain received a call from David Mills, who McCain said [...] "simply wanted some insight as to what specifically I didn't like about his show and how the writers might improve on the next one." ...|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals for {{the tour}} began in March 2007. The set list of the shows {{included}} songs from the standard and deluxe edition of B'Day as well as songs from Dangerously in Love (2003). Ten shortened versions of Destiny's Child's songs were performed, as well as [...] "Listen", a track performed by Knowles on the [...] of the 2006 musical drama film Dreamgirls, in which Knowles had starred. Twenty three people were present on stage with Knowles: ten instrumentalists, three harmony vocalists and ten dancers, from which only four were male. Anthony Venutolo from The Star-Ledger noted that the inclusion of female persons on stage was [...] "a simple, effective way" [...] <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> <b>the</b> theme of female empowerment showcased during the concerts. Both Venutolo and Jon Pareles of The New York Times agreed that the shows used men only as dancers for the female audience. The conception and staging for the concert was done by Knowles, Kim Burse and Frank Gatson Jr. Gatson, Jonte Moaning, Ramone, Anthony Burrell and Danielle Polanco choreographed the dance routines. The tour was managed by Alan Floyd and its sponsors were Samsung and L'Oréal Paris. 75 stage and crew members and 60 tons of stage equipment, most of which was lighting, were present {{for the tour}}. 38 Sennheiser wireless channels {{were used for the}} shows and in a different frequency range, 38 backup wireless channels. The engineering team comprised James Berry who handled monitors for the band, Ramón Morales for Knowles, and Horace Ward at front of house. Sixteen of the wireless channels were devoted to personal monitor systems: 11 in stereo and five in mono. Knowles {{and the rest of the}} band members had a Sennheiser EK 300 IEM G2 monitoring receiver. Eleven of the channels provided wireless instrument support for guitar, bass and horns, using Sennheiser SK 500 G2 bodypack transmitters. The remaining channels covered Knowles' vocal microphone and those of her backup singers and guest vocalists. Sennheiser EM 3032-U and EM 550 G2 true-diversity receivers with Sennheiser A 5000-CP antennas and AC 3000 combiners rounded out the system. Knowles sang through a nickel Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter outfitted with a Neumann KK 105-S capsule. Ward commented that The KK 105-S was an [...] "absolutely stunning microphone... is beautifully smooth and captures every nuance of a talented vocalist's performance".
