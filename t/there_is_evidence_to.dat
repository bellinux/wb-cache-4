5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} earthworks comprising a ditch and rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> show that {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> {{suggest that}} psychoactive {{mushrooms}} {{have been used}} by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes {{to the center of the}} dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E

5|$|In 1111, Domnall mac Taidc {{appears to}} have forcefully seized the kingship of the Isles. Although it is {{possible}} that he had backing from Ua Briain himself, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that made his move without Ua Briain's consent. Not long after this undertaking, Domnall {{appears to have}} been either forced from the Isles, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Ua Briain's failing health, only to be slain himself in 1115. The encroachment of competing Irish factions into the Isles may well have been as unpalatable to the English and Scots as the power vacuum left in the wake of Magnús' demise. Since the chronicle records that the subsequent reign of Óláfr lasted forty years, the latter's accession to the kingship appears to date to about 1112 or 1113, not long after Domnall launched his bid for the throne. In fact, the chronicle indicates that Óláfr spent his youth at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), and it appears that this restoration of the Crovan dynasty, in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother, was the work of the English king.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> {{suggest that}} Sigurðr Hlǫðvisson, Earl of Orkney (died 1014) {{extended}} his authority from Orkney into the Isles {{in the late}} tenth- and early eleventh century. For instance, the thirteenth-century Njáls sagathe only source that specifically refers to Gillistates that one of Sigurðr's followers, Kári Sǫlmundarson, extracted taxes from the northern Hebrides, then controlled by Gilli himself. Whether these taxes were due to Norwegian overlords of Sigurðr, as the saga states, is uncertain. The saga further declares that Sigurðr and his men defeated Guðrøðr Haraldsson, King of the Isles (died 989), after which they plundered the Isles. Also noted are additional assaults conducted by accomplices of Sigurðr throughout the Hebrides, Kintyre, Mann (against Guðrøðr), and Anglesey. The thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga also reports Sigurðr's raids into the Isles, as does Eyrbyggja saga, a thirteenth-century source which further notes his taxation of the kingdom. Contemporary Orcadian expansion may be perceptible in {{the evidence of the}} land-assessment system of ouncelands in the Hebrides and along the western coast of Scotland. If Sigurðr's authority indeed stretched over the Isles in the last decades of the tenth century, such an intrusion could account for the numbers of silver hoards dating to this time.|$|E

25|$|Both {{regulatory}} T {{cells and}} Th3 cells produce the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and IL-10.
