50|$|HSV-1 infects {{more than}} 90% of adults {{over the age}} of 50. Alphaherpesviruses alone can cause the host to have mild symptoms, but <b>these</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{associated}} with severe disease when they are transferred to a new species. Humans can even pass and also get an HSV-1 infection from other primate species. However, because of evolutionary differences between primate species, only some species can pass HSV-1 in an interspecies interaction. Also, though HSV-1 transmission from humans to other species primates can occur, there is no known sustained transmission chains that have resulted from constant transmission. A study found that Nbs1 is the most diverged in DNA sequence in the MRN complex between different primate species {{and that there is a}} high degree of species specificity, causing variability in promotion of the HSV-1 life cycle. The same study found that Nbs1 interacts with HSV-1's ICP0 proteins in an area of structural disorder of the nibrin. This suggests that in general, viruses commonly interact in intrinsically disordered domains in host proteins. It is possible that there are differences in the mammalian genomes that create unique environments for the viruses. Host proteins that are specific to the species might determine how the viruses must adapt to be able to ignite an infection in a new species. The evolution of increased disorder in nibrin benefits the host in decreasing ICP0 interaction and virus hijack. Nbs1 may not be the only host protein that evolves this way.|$|E

40|$|Author Summary Genetic {{recombination}} between viruses {{is a form}} of parasexual reproduction {{during which}} two parental viruses each contribute genetic information to an offspring, or recombinant, virus. Unlike with sexual reproduction, however, recombination in <b>viruses</b> <b>can</b> even involve the transfer of sequences between the members of distantly related species. When parental genomes are very distantly related, it is anticipated that recombination between them runs the risk of producing defective offspring. The {{reason for this is that}} the interactions between different parts of genomes and the proteins they encode (such as between different viral proteins or between viral proteins and the virus genomic DNA or RNA) often depend on particular co-evolved binding sites that recognize one another. When in a recombinant genome the partners in a binding site pair are each inherited from different parents there is a possibility that they will not interact with one another properly. Here we examine recombinant genomes arising during experimental mixed infections of two distantly related viruses to detect evidence that intra-genome interaction networks are broadly preserved in these genomes. We show this preservation is so strict that patterns of recombination in <b>these</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>can</b> even <b>be</b> used to identify the interacting regions within their genomes...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses are {{ubiquitous}} agents {{present in}} wild mice {{as well as}} inbred laboratory mice.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is black virus {{disinfection}} using mobile agents. The black virus is a faulty node that destroys any visiting agent without leaving a trace; moreover, once the black virus is triggered by an agent, it clones itself and spreads to neighbouring nodes. <b>These</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> destroyed if {{they move to}} nodes that have been occupied by agents. In this thesis, we consider the black virus disinfection problem in chordal rings. Initially, the system contains a single black virus that resides at an unknown location.

Our protocol {{is divided into two}} phases: 1) searching the graph until the black virus is found and triggered and 2) sending agents to occupy the neighbouring nodes of the black virus in order to trigger and destroy all the black viruses at once. Our solutions are monotone, meaning that once a node has been explored it is protected from re-infection. In order to measure the efficiency of our protocol we consider the total number of agents required for disinfection, the overall number of black viruses and the number of moves required by the agents. We then analyze the cost of all our solutions, providing optimal bounds for some classes of chordal rings...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{gene therapy}} must deliver {{therapeutic}} genes to disease sites while avoiding healthy tissue. However, engineering targeted gene delivery vectors to ensure exclusive delivery to diseased sites remains a challenge. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is receiving increasing attention for its {{potential as a}} gene delivery vehicle because it offers several advantages: it is considered the safest viral vector, it infects human cells efficiently, and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> genetically altered to improve therapeutic efficacy. However, even slight modifications to the virus capsid (the outer protein shell covering its genome) lead to unpredictable outcomes. Thus, a governing set of design rules for virus capsid assembly and function is needed to improve future engineering efforts. To this end, this thesis uncovers some of these rules by applying a computational model, often used in protein engineering, to the AAV capsid. A new strategy to improve AAV targeting was also explored by engineering AAVs to sense and become activated by extracellular proteases found in diseased tissues.

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{protein synthesis}} is regulated {{by a set}} of initiation factors (eIF) that are required for recruiting the 40 S ribosomal subunit onto the mRNA molecule. Among these proteins, eIF 4 GI, which is targeted by picornaviral proteases, makes a bridge between the mRNA cap structure (via eIF 4 E) and the 40 S ribosome (via eIF 3). Recently, internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) elements have been characterized in the genomic RNA of both simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), suggesting that viral expression of <b>these</b> two <b>viruses</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> regulated at the translational level.
