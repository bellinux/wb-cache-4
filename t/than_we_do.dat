5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
25|$|Introjection: Identifying {{with some}} idea or object so deeply {{that it becomes}} {{a part of that}} person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on {{attributes}} of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|We {{should be}} candid about the {{interests}} surrounding Indian gaming. The issue {{has never really}} been one of crime control, morality, or economic fairness...At issue is economics...Ironically, the strongest opponents of tribal authority over gaming on Indian lands are from States whose liberal gaming policies {{would allow them to}} compete on an equal basis with the tribes...We must not impose greater moral restraints on Indians <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> on the rest of our citizenry. - Daniel Inouye, Senior United States Senator from Hawaii.|$|E

500|$|Despite the defeat, Liverpool manager Joe Fagan {{could not}} fault the effort his players had put in: [...] "Independiente {{are a good}} {{defensive}} tactical team and we could find no way through, the weather was ideal, we were just as fit as they were. The South Americans have better ball control <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> We were disappointed with the result but I wasn't disappointed with the display." ...|$|E
500|$|Milius felt, [...] "all {{the basic}} {{emotions}} [...] are always accessible to audiences. All {{of the things}} that Conan does we all feel ourselves. He just acts on them with more intensity <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> He is a character who relies on the animal. And I always believe that the animal instincts are often the worst part of them. All you do when you evolve is corrupt yourself sooner or later." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group B, along with Italian club Inter Milan, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> It is tough to go to Russia – I always {{say that if you}} have to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone will come {{up with the idea of}} spending more money <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do...</b> The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, Quesada stated that, beyond {{connecting}} to themselves, the Netflix series would {{connect with the}} films and other television series. In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity [...] "certainly" [...] exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in [...] In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to The Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into Thor 2 and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [...] They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of Winter Soldier or [...] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season. By the time our movie comes out, they'd be [...] So finding the timing on that is not always easy.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{result of}} the {{election}} was announced on 13 December 2014 at Glasgow's Emirates Arena; Murphy secured an overall majority with 55.8 per cent {{of the vote in}} the first round. His closest rival was Findlay with 35.0 per cent, while Boyack was third with 9.2 per cent. Murphy also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and individual members. Findlay was backed by the majority of party affiliates. In {{the first round of the}} deputy leadership race, Dugdale secured 62.9 per cent of the vote compared to 37.1 per cent for Clark. Dugdale was also backed by parliamentarians and individual party members, while affiliates gave their majority support to Clark. In his victory speech, Murphy said that his election marked a [...] "fresh start" [...] for Scottish Labour: [...] "Scotland is changing and so too is Scottish Labour. I'm ambitious for our party because I'm ambitious for our country". He also said that he planned to defeat the SNP in 2016, and that he would use the increased powers being devolved to Holyrood to end poverty and inequality. Urging Labour voters who had backed independence to support his vision for the party, he claimed Labour had [...] "so much more in common with [...] voted 'Yes' in the referendum <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with many of the political leaders who campaigned for 'No' on the 18th of September". In her speech, Dugdale said that the party's [...] "focus has to be on the future – a Scottish Labour party that's fighting fit and fighting for our future".|$|E

50|$|The {{second line}} counts as a false premise. However, by the {{previous}} argument, this suggests we have fewer justified beliefs <b>than</b> <b>we</b> think <b>we</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Alternately, Pequigney {{believes}} [...] "the answer [...] {{depends on}} our mood as we read it." [...] He maintains that [...] "we {{learn more about}} ourselves when we interpret this poem <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about its author." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1995, the House {{voted to}} {{prohibit}} {{members and their}} staffs from receiving gifts, including free meals and free travel to charity sports events. Burton, who led the effort to exempt charity trips, said that he played in two golf tournaments each year, and, [...] "We get more of these lobbyists in our office <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> on the golf course." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, the ADL {{urged the}} US House of Representatives to delay {{approval}} of Ukraine's graduation from the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The ADL National Director Abraham Foxman wrote: [...] "We expect more from democratic states <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> from totalitarian ones. This year alone {{has seen a}} steep increase in acts of violence and vandalism against Jews across Ukraine. There have been attempts to ban everything from Jewish organizations to Jewish holy texts. [...] The university MAUP [...] actively promotes anti-Semitism of the most vicious kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{instead of}} {{remaining}} here {{we had better}} cross the river {{as soon as we}} have our cases of goods. If we can only get a store in a good location <b>we</b> may <b>do</b> better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> on circus day in those other places." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although DeBerry {{had been}} {{portrayed as a}} role-model {{for most of his}} career, he came under fire for {{controversial}} racial remarks made he made in October 2005 after a 48-10 loss to Texas Christian University (TCU). DeBerry said TCU [...] "had a lot more Afro-American players <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> and they ran a lot faster <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> Afro-American kids can run very well. That doesn't mean that Caucasian kids and other descents can't run, but it's very obvious to me that they run extremely well." [...] Earlier that year, DeBerry had been criticized for a banner posted in the team's locker room that was interpreted by some as inappropriate religious proselytizing.|$|R
60|$|Under all the circumstances, Captain Williams {{determined}} {{to get on the}} weather-quarter of our neighbour, and take a still nearer look at him. That he was armed, we could see already; and, as near as we could make out, he carried twelve guns, or just two more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> ourselves. All this was encouraging; sufficiently so, at least, to induce us to make a much closer examination <b>than</b> <b>we</b> had yet <b>done.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 'When {{they are}} sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek {{them out and}} {{administer}} to their necessities? [...] Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? [...] Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut {{for the purpose of}} alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. [...] Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the cattle in the field?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the June 2007 {{issue of}} GQ magazine, Sheffield (a Detroit Tiger at the time) was quoted {{saying that there}} are more Latin {{baseball}} players than African-American players because Latinos are easier to control. [...] "What I said is that you're going to see more black faces, but there ain't no English going to be coming out. ... (It's about) being able to tell (Latin players) what to do — being able to control them.... Where I'm from, you can't control us." [...] He continued [...] "They have more to lose <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> You can send them back across the island. You can't send us back. We're already here." ...|$|E
2500|$|People tend {{to believe}} as {{dictated}} by their own emotions, projections, and transferences. ... Our judgment should really be guided by what the protagonists never tired of asserting themselves: {{that there was no}} sex. In the final analysis the question is whether we believe their testimony or not. I choose to believe them, and not out of prudery, but because in those days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to Spielrein, differently <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> today; moreover, because unconsummated sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular press and professional journals.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Rabbit hugged {{himself with}} glee {{as he watched}} the faces of Happy Jack and Chatterer. [...] "They don't know any more about their family <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> about ours," [...] he whispered in one of the long ears of Jumper the Hare.|$|R
