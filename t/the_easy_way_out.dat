5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
25|$|Kathy persuades The Samaritans to {{take her}} back as a volunteer, on the {{condition}} she is shadowed following her previous stint. Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson) phones The Samaritans and tells Kathy her baby, Billie O'Brien, {{is the product of}} rape and fathered by her stepfather, Ken Raynor (Ian Redford). Willmott-Brown is released from prison. He sends Kathy a tape telling her that he wants to meet her and that he has changed. Kathy pleads with him to leave and never return but he moves to the Square and continues to pester her, until Kathy relays the hurt and anger he had caused her, gaining some closure. James threatens suicide but Kathy stops him, refusing to let him take <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> After a heated conversation in which James pleads for forgiveness, Kathy convinces him to leave Walford. She also convinces Pete — who has been hoping for reconciliation — that their marriage is over. Later, Kathy begins a relationship with market inspector Richard Cole (Ian Reddington), which sours when she discovers that he is taking a cash bribe and allowing a mobile hot dog van to trade in direct competition with her café.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews also {{commented on}} the game's {{relationship}} with Final Fantasy VII. 1UP.com called {{it one of the}} best prequels of all time, arguing that it [...] "does a better job of putting players in FFVII's world than even the original game did." [...] While GameTrailers stated that Crisis Core [...] "doesn't take <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and photocopy the source," [...] they found it, unlike Dirge of Cerberus, to be appealing. Computer and Video Games mentioned that despite the game's main story only lasting 12 hours, the side-quests helped expand the game's length. They further praised the battle system, claiming [...] " [...] never becomes tiresome," [...] and {{the fact that some of}} the weak points from Final Fantasy VII ("lengthy wandering, and an overlong center") were not issues in this game.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave a very {{positive}} review. [...] "Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film." [...] Ebert placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. James Berardinelli believed [...] "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's {{one of the most}} wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message {{at the end of the}} credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II." [...] Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Dave Kehr felt [...] "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit." [...] Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as [...] "simply puffed-up TV episodes." ...|$|E

And that's it. John Barleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and failure, to weariness and exhaustion. He is <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> And he is lying all the time. He offers false strength to the body, false elevation to the spirit, making things seem what they are not and vastly fairer than what they are.|$|E

500|$|Though {{these letters}} {{had already been}} {{returned}} to her, Ellet asked her brother [...] "to demand of me the letters". Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, {{did not believe that}} Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from Thomas Dunn English. English, Poe's friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer, likewise did not believe that Poe had already returned the letters and even questioned their existence. <b>The</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> predicament, he said, [...] "was a retraction of unfounded charges". Angered at being called a liar, Poe pushed English into a fistfight. Poe later claimed he was triumphant in the fight, though English claimed otherwise, and Poe's face was badly cut by one of English's rings. In Poe's version, he said, [...] "I gave E. a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death." [...] Either way, the fight further sparked gossip over the Osgood affair.|$|R

60|$|Elma {{had a bad}} time, therefore, {{during all}} those long days, even before Guy {{returned}} to England. She knew his life hung by a slender thread, which Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve might cut short at any moment. But her anxiety was as nothing compared to Sir Gilbert's own. That unhappy man, a moral coward at heart, {{in spite of all}} his blustering, lay writhing in his own room now, very ill, and longing to be worse, longing to die, as <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of this impossible difficulty. For his wife's sake, for Gwendoline's sake, it was better he should die; and if only he could, he would have left Guy Waring to his fate contentedly. His anger against Guy burnt so bright now at last that he would have sacrificed him willingly, provided he was not there himself to see and know it. What did the man mean by living on to vex him? Over and over again the unhappy judge wished himself dead, and prayed to be taken. But that powerful frame, though severely broken by the shock, seemed hardly able to yield up its life merely because its owner was anxious to part with it.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rise}} of the risk society came the {{regulatory}} state. Increasingly, governments are turning to law for achieving their policy goals, also in the field of urban and environmental planning. Legal rules do not only reduce the risks for society but also for policy makers, since those standardise decision-making, hence reducing discretion and chances of personal failure. The result is an increasingly complex legal system and a juridification of planning in practice. While planning has become more legalistic, in the Netherlands we see {{at the same time that}} the access to the legal system is being reduced. How can this seeming contradiction be explained? In this paper we explore, conceptually, the relationship between the risk society and the regulatory state. Then we turn to the empirical body of the paper, in which we observe that Dutch government is responding to the negative consequences of the regulatory state by taking major decisions with regard to the entrance to the legal system. Third-party rights are under scrutiny. We conclude our paper by arguing that government has chosen <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> juridification of planning. Rather than a fundamental contemplation on the relationship between law and society, government pragmatically chooses to limit access to the legal system. This leads to a paradoxical situation where our (environmental) quality requirements for a land-use plan are becoming greater, while the means available to citizens for ensuring that these requirements are met move in the opposite direction...|$|R
