5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought <b>that</b> <b>Card</b> Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial made it easy to learn.|$|E
5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, <b>that</b> <b>card</b> is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E

For example, a hot-listed (or cancelled) card's number will be sent out to all processors (usually within 1–2 days of being reported), and when the card is next used the 'tag on' will be declined and the card updated to cancelled status (resulting in it being rejected in the future).|$|E

The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a personal identification number (PIN).

25|$|The {{bill which}} would {{eventually}} become CALRA {{was introduced in}} both chambers of the state legislature on April 10, 1975. Top UFW staff member Dolores Huerta acted as the farm worker union's chief lobbyist. With McCarthy, some growers, and the UFW behind the bill, a key State Senate committee approved the bill on May 7. Key labor unions (including the Teamsters), arguing <b>that</b> <b>card</b> check rather than secret ballot elections should be the bill's preferred method of resolving unionization disputes, opposed the bill. Nonetheless, a key State Assembly committee approved it on May 12, despite attempts by some Teamster members to intimidate legislators into opposing the bill.

25|$|In {{variations}} of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction {{from all other}} variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep <b>that</b> <b>card</b> for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, without looking at it, creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether she or he preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.|$|E
25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of {{revolving}} credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on <b>that</b> <b>card</b> or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} Wagner's strong {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} ATC's request {{have been the subject}} of much speculation. The most commonly told account is that Wagner rejected the deal because he did not want young baseball fans to purchase the tobacco packs for his baseball card. Wagner held high respect for many of his fans, most particularly his young fans. His granddaughter, Blair, remarked that [...] "e loved children. He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship. When it came time for <b>that</b> <b>card</b> to come out, it wasn't that he wasn't paid. He didn't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card." [...] However, Wagner chewed tobacco, and he had previously appeared in advertisements for many tobacco products, including a cigar baseball trading card in 1899 and a newspaper ad for Murad cigarettes during the 1909 World Series.|$|E
500|$|Sora's and Riku's stories differ gameplay-wise {{in several}} ways. In Sora's story, Sora obtains cards by {{defeating}} enemies or through Moogle Shops.

Unlike Sora, Riku has a closed deck that cannot be customized. The cards in his deck change depending on {{the world in which}} he is traveling. Riku is limited to mainly physical attacks, enemy cards and Mickey Mouse ally cards. He can activate [...] "dark mode" [...] and unlock his sleight attacks if he accumulates enough [...] "dark points". Dark points are earned by breaking enemy cards and combos, and the difference between Riku's card or combo and the enemy's card or combo is how many dark points he will accumulate for <b>that</b> <b>card</b> break.|$|E
