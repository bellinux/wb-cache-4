5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E
25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they {{have a tendency to}} punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} in February 1816, Ochterlony decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure {{there would have been}} a disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow Birith to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach Hariharpur Gadhi. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if they were able to get only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade’s strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to Makawanpur by the end of March 1815 AD.|$|E

25|$|In December 1944 it {{was decided}} to deploy Bibers against traffic to Antwerp in the Scheldt Estuary. The force was based at Rotterdam with forward bases at Poortershaven and Hellevoetsluis. The first attack took place {{on the night of the}} 22/23 of December. Eighteen Biber were {{involved}} of which only one returned. The only allied loss caused by the operation was Alan A. Dale. Further operations between the 23rd and the 25th achieved no success and none of the 14 submarines deployed survived. On the 27th the accidental release of a torpedo in the Voorneschen resulted in the sinking of 11 Bibers (although they were later recovered). The three undamaged Bibers later sailed again; none returned. An operation on the night 29/30 January resulted in damage to (much of it due to ice) or loss of most of the remaining Bibers. Losses combined with RAF bombing prevented attacks from being mounted in February 1945. The bombing had damaged the cranes used to move the Bibers into and out of the water. Reinforcements allowed operations to continue until April 1945 but no successes were achieved and the Biber flotillas continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high rate of losses. The last Biber mission was an attempt at mine laying and took place on the night of 26 April. Of the four Bibers that took part, one ran aground and three were attacked by Thunderbolts, which sank two of them.|$|E

"But to read {{popular culture}} as a straight-forward– or at least typical– {{political}} text is <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> narrow view of its meaning, and hence of its political message(s). As we have noted, the text's meaning {{will depend on how}} it is heard and read. Michael Jackson may have intended his 'Earth Song' as an exercise in compassion; others– like Jarvis Cocker– saw it quite differently. One reason these alternative readings emerge is {{because of the way the}} performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text, it employs gestures and symbols, tones of voice, looks and glances, all of which might tell a different story".|$|E

2500|$|Due to the band's {{worldwide}} popularity, Tourniquet {{has performed}} in the US, Canada, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Brazil and Puerto Rico. Their music has received notice in the mainstream media, {{as well as the}} CCM market. The music video for [...] "Ark of Suffering" [...] received airplay on MTV, and garnered attention for its stance on animal abuse. Tourniquet has continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> public stance on this issue, and so have been interviewed about it in magazines such as Vegetarian Times, Journal of the United Animal Nations, Animal’s Agenda and by PETA. Some critics have described them as being more proficient than many of their counterparts, and the band members have appeared in many music magazines. For example, Kirkpatrick has been featured on Modern Drummer, Drums, and Aaron Guerra has been interviewed in Guitar World and Guitar for the Practicing Musician.|$|E
