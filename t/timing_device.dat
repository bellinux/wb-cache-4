5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted, as the <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> was faulty. In February {{there was a large}} explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship. Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 1978, {{there were}} three {{separate}} explosions from improvised explosive devices placed in trash bins around the town. The damage was minor, {{and no one was}} injured. Speedway authorities called on explosive experts from the Indiana State Police, Marion County Sheriff's Department, 64th Ordnance from nearby Fort Benjamin Harrison and specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. They formed a 100-strong taskforce to solve the case. The devices were simple homemade bombs constructed from soda cans packed with Tovex 200 and triggered with a rudimentary <b>timing</b> <b>device.</b> The following Saturday, two more blasts hit Speedway with another the day after at the local bowling alley. The next day, a device exploded under the car of an off duty Speedway police officer, who was on sick leave at the time and was not injured.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena, the Magic {{eliminated}} the Raptors with a 4–1 series {{victory in the}} first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success didn't last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At {{the conclusion of the}} 3rd quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed {{from the time of the}} malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted. The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Ken Gormley, {{author of}} The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals {{in his book}} that Clinton {{narrowly}} escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During {{his visit to the}} Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while {{he was on his way}} to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). According to officials, the IED was large enough to [...] "blow up the entire presidential motorcade". Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word [...] "wedding" [...] was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> in a travel bag. Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden. Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the opening}} statements, the {{prosecution}} began presenting witnesses. Crucial testimony at Cherry's trial was delivered by his former wife, Willadean Brogdon, whom Cherry had married in 1970.

Brogdon also testified that Cherry had informed her of his regret that children had died in the bombing, before adding of his contentment that they would never reproduce. Although the credibility of Brogdon's testimony was called into dispute at the trial, forensic experts did concede that, although her account of the planting of the bombing differed from that which had been discussed in the previous perpetrators' trials, Brogdon's recollection of Cherry's account of the planting and subsequent lighting of the bomb could explain why no conclusive remnants of a <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> were subsequently discovered after the bombing.
