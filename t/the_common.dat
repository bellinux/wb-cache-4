40|$|Scholarship on <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> {{focuses on}} a diverse set of problems, ranging from {{crashing}} fisheries to crowded court dockets. Because we find commons resources throughout our natural and cultural environments, understanding old lessons and learning new ones about <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> gives us leverage to address {{a wide range of}} problems. Because the list of resources identified as commons resources continues to grow, the importance of gleaning lessons about <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> will also continue to grow. That being said, while the resources that make up <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> are certainly diverse, so too are the ways scholars depict it and the challenges it faces. Consider, for example, how three of <b>the</b> most prominent <b>commons</b> scholars capture <b>the</b> likeness of the commons: Garrett Hardin, a celebrated ecologist who gave us the concept of the tragedy of <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> spoke of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> as an all-out free-forall. Elinor Ostrom, a Nobel Prize winner and a world-renowned political scientist, devoted much of her career to helping us understand how to govern <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> to avoid tragic ends. She showed us that in <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> we often find ways to keep our consumption and that of others at bay. Ostrom also made famous a number of case studies that provide examples of where use of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> is sustainable for long periods of time, even centuries. Carol Rose, a giant within legal academia, helped us see that sometimes an additional user of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> leads to positive rather than negative ends. She explained that sometimes we face a comedy of <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> as opposed to a tragedy. In such a case, the challenge of a commons is not imposing diets or trimming a guest list. Rather, the challenge is drawing additional people into a commons feast. Echoes of these characterizations of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> are found throughout <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> literature. This Essay tries to unify these three stories that we tell and retell about <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> To do so, it focuses on the strands that bind these stories together into a single narrative. Quite coincidentally, the overarching theme of this larger narrative very much follows the storyline of an extended tragicomedy. And, like any tragicomedy, this narrative has two dominant strands. One strand is plagued with challenges, most of which {{can be traced back to}} the internal characteristics of the commons––the nature of the resource, the traits of its users, <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> is governed, and the value placed on <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> resource. <b>The</b> second strand is one of hope—that through governance we can overcome these internal challenges and this inertia. However, hope in this context is fragile. Fortunately, even though the storyline is difficult to alter, the end of each commons story is ours to write...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{centuries of}} {{enclosure}} and commodification, <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> remain an enduring way of organising, {{and one that}} may have an increasing relevance as we fall further into economic and ecological crisis. After exploring the ambivalent relationships between <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> and capitalism, <b>the</b> paper argues that <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> are best understood not as a resource but as a social process of organisation and production. The paper begins by considering the work of Elinor Ostrom, which has been essential in demonstrating that <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> involve community, some collective organisation for sharing and preserving common resources. Ostrom, however, only considered some aspects of <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> She explored how communities organise in commons to share resources between individual members but she ignored <b>the</b> fact that <b>commons</b> may not only be distributed in common but also {{may be used in}} commons and in this process may be reproductive of community. The paper moves on to explore these processes of organising for <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> and of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> by drawing on three brief examples: a commune, a community of local residents reclaiming their neighbourhood and a social centre. Using these examples, the paper then discusses the mode of organising that underpins <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> in terms of the production and distribution of use as well as the reliance on the principle of ‘reciprocity in perpetuity’ (Pedersen, 2010). The conclusion suggests that considering the failure of markets and states to address the crises in which we find ourselves, developing and understanding <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> has become an urgent task.

5|$|As {{a longer}} term and more {{significant}} development, the Bill of Middlesex {{was one of}} several revolutionary developments by the King's Bench met with a conservative reaction from <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas, fearful of losing its own caseload. The troubles during this period are best illustrated by Slade's Case. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts. In Slade's Case, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, John Popham, deliberately provoked <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King's Bench could vote, allowing them to overrule <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action. After the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas, which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on the business of <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between {{the old and new}} forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
