5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, {{leading to the}} cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After {{the threat of violence}} subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E

Despite spending <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> with Crewe, the club decided not to offer Johnson a full-time contract, because coach Steve Holland felt he was not better than the club's other forwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{spent the}} following {{winter and spring}} near Charleston, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), out of contact with the enemy. Hayes saw little action until July 1863, when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island. Returning to Charleston for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> Hayes spent the fall encouraging {{the men of the}} 23rd Ohio to re-enlist, and many did so. In 1864, the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized, and Hayes's division was assigned to George Crook's Army of West Virginia. Advancing into southwestern Virginia, they destroyed Confederate salt and lead mines there. On May 9, they engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd's Mountain, where Hayes and his men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field. Following the rout, the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and again successfully skirmished with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E
