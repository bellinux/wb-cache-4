40|$|Abstract This chapter {{presents}} {{an overview of}} <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> efficiently serving and caching dynamic web data. We describe <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> invoking server programs and architectures for serving dynamic web content. Caching is crucially important for improving the performance of Web sites generating significant dynamic data. We discuss <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> caching dynamic Web data consistently. Fragmentbased web publication can significantly improve performance and increase the cacheability of dynamic web data. These techniques assume the existence of mechanisms for creating fragments. We discuss <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> automatically detecting fragments in web pages. It is often desirable to provide content with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. We examine <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> providing QoS under overload conditions. We also look at <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> providing differentiated QoS...|$|R

40|$|<b>Techniques</b> <b>for</b> {{test-case}} prioritization re-order {{test cases}} {{to increase their}} rate of fault detection. When there is a fixed time budget that does not allow the execution of all the test cases, time-aware <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> test-case prioritization may achieve a better rate of fault detection than traditional <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> test-case prioritization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to time-aware test-case prioritization using integer linear programming. To evaluate our approach, we performed experiments on two subject programs involving four <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> our approach, two <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> an approach to time-aware test-case prioritization based on genetic algorithms, and four traditional <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> testcase prioritization. The empirical results indicate that two of our techniques outperform all the other <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> the two subjects under the scenarios of both general and version-specific prioritization. The empirical results also indicate that some traditional techniques with lower analysis time cost for test-case prioritization may still perform competitively when the time budget is not quite tight...|$|R

Results indicate that "pointing" techniques are advantageous relative to "gaze-directed" steering <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> a relative motion task, and that motion techniques which instantly teleport users to new locations are correlated with increased user disorientation. 1.
