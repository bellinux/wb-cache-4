5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is real according to Tulsidas, {{in keeping with the}} Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
