40|$|Summary. One {{hundred and}} forty- two coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) {{isolated}} from dialysate effluent or skin of patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) were <b>typed</b> by extended antibiogram (16 antibiotics) and biotype (26 reactions). These isolates were then <b>typed</b> by supplementary methods {{to determine the}} most suitable <b>typing</b> method for an epidemiological study of antibiotic resistance. These included phage <b>typing,</b> reverse phage <b>typing,</b> plasmid <b>typing,</b> whole-cell protein <b>typing</b> by SDS-PAGE with analysis by densitometry, and immunoblotting. The percentage of isolates <b>typed</b> successfully by the supplementary methods were: phage <b>typing</b> 20 %, reverse phage <b>typing</b> 0 %, plasmid <b>typing</b> 66 %, SDS-PAGE 100 %, immunoblotting 100 YO. The discrimination of each method was: phage <b>typing</b> 20 YO, plasmid <b>typing</b> 37 %, SDS-PAGE 69 %, immunoblotting 57 YO. Reproducibility was 88 % for phage <b>typing</b> and 97 % for plasmid <b>typing.</b> The reproducibility of the whole-cell protein <b>typing</b> was 83 % if the same extracts were used but only 43 YO when separate protein extracts were analysed on separate occasions. However, strain relatedness was highly reproducible. The determination of an antibiogram-biotype profile was not a sufficiently accurate <b>typing</b> method for an epidemiological study of antibiotic resistance. Whole-cell protein <b>typing</b> by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting was technically demanding but was the most effective of the supplementary methods for detecting erroneous discrimination and false matching produced by antibiogram- biotype combinations...|$|R

On 17 June 1945, with the war in Europe at an end, Belfast sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Sydney.

5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are <b>Type</b> I, <b>Type</b> II, <b>Type</b> III and <b>Type</b> IV. <b>Type</b> I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. <b>Type</b> II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The <b>Type</b> III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as <b>Type</b> I ambulances. <b>Type</b> IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds.

40|$|Background: The aim {{of present}} study was {{evaluation}} and comparison of widely used molecular techniques including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi locus sequence <b>typing</b> (MLST), Staphylococcus aureus protein A <b>typing</b> (spa), Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome <b>typing</b> (SCCmec), and SCCmec <b>typing</b> with recently introduced method using direct repeat unit (dru) sequencing in the hyper-variable region of the SCCmec cassette for clustering and discrimination of MRSA isolates. Material and Methods: Out of 389 already molecularly established methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates 61 representative samples were subjected to PFGE and dru <b>typing</b> methods according to guideline. Results: The results showed that isolates were <b>typed</b> by PFGE <b>typing,</b> MLST <b>typing,</b> spa <b>typing,</b> SCCmec was <b>typing</b> and dru <b>typing</b> to 7, 6, 6, 12, 19 different <b>types</b> respectively. Evaluation of the discriminatory power for each method identified dru <b>typing</b> and PFGE as the most discriminatory methods. Conclusion: Although the discriminatory ability of dru <b>typing,</b> especially with closely related MRSA ST 239 strains underscore its utility as a feasible and cheap method in epidemiological investigation of MRSA, we suggest {{the use of the}} conjugation of dru <b>typing</b> and PFGE <b>typing</b> for epidemiological surveillance studies, since this combination provides more discriminatory and typeability which is useful for the control of nosocomial infection...|$|R
