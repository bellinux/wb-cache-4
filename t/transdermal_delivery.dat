Due to the various biomedical benefits, it has attracted many researches. The barrier nature of stratumcorneum poses a danger to the drug delivery. By using microneedles, a pathway into the human body can be recognized which allow transportation of macromolecular drugs such as insulin or vaccine. These microneedles only penetrate outer layers of the skin, exterior sufficient not to reach the nerve receptors of the deeper skin. Thus the microneedles supplement is supposed painless and reduces the infection and injuries. Researches from the past few years showed that microneedles have emerged as a novel carrier and considered to be effective for safe and improved delivery of the different drugs.

40|$|Optimum {{therapeutic}} outcomes require {{not only}} proper drug selection, but also effective drug delivery. Scientists are exploring {{new methods of}} drug administration to improve patient compliance and enhance drug response. In many instances, oral administration of psychotropics is considered a less than optimal medication delivery system due to non-compliance. One potential method to help promote compliance is to develop psychotropic medications that can be delivered via a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches are used for treatment of various indications including pain, pregnancy prevention, and hormone replacement. In many cases, <b>transdermal</b> medication <b>delivery</b> is believed to offer many advantages over conventional oral therapies.

5000|$|Sonophoresis is {{a process}} that {{exponentially}} increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, usually consisting of hydrophilic molecules and macromolecules, (<b>transdermal</b> <b>delivery)</b> into the epidermis, dermis and skin appendages.

This technology {{has been found to be}} most effective at low frequencies (less than 100 kHz). [...] It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer to the skin. The ultrasound probably enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating. Sonophoresis is also used without drug delivery in physical therapy, and as a complementary modality for iontophoresis.|$|E

40|$|Sonophoresis can {{increase}} skin permeability to various drugs in <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery.</b> Cavitation {{is recognized as}} the predominant mechanism of sonophoresis. Recently, a new logical approach to enhance the efficiency of <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery</b> was tried. It is to utilize the engineered microbubble and its resonant frequency for increase of cavitation activity. Actively-induced cavitation with low-intensity ultrasound (less than ~ 1 MPa) causes disordering of the lipid bilayers {{and the formation of}} aqueous channels by stable cavitation which indicates a continuous oscillation of bubbles. Furthermore, the mutual interactions of microbubble determined by concentration of added bubble are also thought to be an important factor for activity of stable cavitation, even in different characteristics of drug. In the present study, we addressed the dependence of ultrasound contrast agent concentration using two types of drug on the efficiency of <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery.</b> Two types of experiment were designed to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery</b> according to ultrasound contrast agent concentration. First, an experiment of optical clearing using a tissue optical clearing agent was designed to assess the efficiency of sonophoresis with ultrasound contrast agents. Second, a Franz diffusion cell with ferulic acid was used to quantitatively determine the amount of drug delivered to the skin sample by sonophoresis with ultrasound contrast agents. The maximum enhancement ratio of sonophoresis with a concentration of 1 : 1, 000 was approximately 3. 1 times greater than that in the ultrasound group without ultrasound contrast agent and approximately 7. 5 times greater than that in the control group. These results support our hypothesis that sonophoresis becomes more effective in <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery</b> due to the presence of engineered bubbles, and that the efficiency of <b>transdermal</b> drug <b>delivery</b> using sonophoresis with microbubbles depends on the concentration of microbubbles in case stable cavitation is predominant...|$|R
