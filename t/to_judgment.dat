5|$|J. Grossman's Sons was a {{business}} that had been operating in New Orleans, Louisiana since at least 1884. By the early 1900s, the business was being run by both Adolph Grossman and Isidore Grossman. Prior to developing Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons served as creditors. In 1905 for example, a collection attorney successfully sued J. Grossman's Sons to recover legal fees for reducing <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> a debt of $875 owed to J. Grossman's Sons. Also in 1905, J. Grossman's Sons unsuccessfully prevented the sale of their securing collateral, a debtor's home, to the debtor's daughter. In January 1912, J. Grossman's Sons lent $1000 to a Lewisburg, Louisiana saloon owner who they successfully sued eleven months later to recover the amount against his real estate.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. Two months prior <b>to</b> <b>Judgment</b> Day, at WrestleMania 21, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero. In {{the weeks that}} followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team title after Guerrero walked {{out in the middle}} of the match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the Tag Team championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Teddy Long booked a Street Fight match, a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match, Mercury and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} respect the foreigners' self-government, there were limits on the {{abilities}} of Japanese to enter the settlement and of Japan to exercise police power in the area. Due to the extraterritoriality enforced by unequal treaties, legal disputes involving Westerners were subject <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> by their consulates. The right to self-government was tied {{to the land of}} the settlement, and thus did not apply outside its boundaries, but the right to consular jurisdiction was tied to the people it applied to, and thus extended even to disputes that occurred outside the settlement. In practice, foreigners claimed the same extraterritoriality outside the settlement that they did inside, which sometimes developed into trouble with the Japanese side.|$|E

The Mishnah does not claim to be the development of new laws, but rather the collection of existing traditions.|$|E

The po and hun are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants. Eventually both the po and hun go to the underworld, although the hun goes to heaven first.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to test for the use of the {{representativeness}} heuristic by auditors in situations in which its use will lead <b>to</b> <b>judgments</b> that systematically depart from the Bayesian optimal responses.
