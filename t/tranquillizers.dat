25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps {{social phobia}} or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as <b>tranquillizers</b> to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>tranquillizer</b> gun (also spelled {{tranquilizer}} gun or tranquilliser gun), capture gun or dart gun, is a non-lethal air gun {{often used}} for incapacitating animal targets via projectile injection of anesthetic chemicals usually referred as tranquilizers. [...] These guns shoot darts with a hypodermic needle tip, filled with a dose of tranquilizer solution that is either sedative, comatosing or paralytic, which once injected will temporarily impair the target's physical function to a level that allows it to be approached and handled in an unresisting and thus safe manner. <b>Tranquillizer</b> guns {{have a long history}} of use to capture wildlife without risking serious injuries to both the hunter and the target. <b>Tranquillizer</b> darts can also be fired by crossbow or breath-powered blowgun.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tranquillizer</b> darts are not {{generally}} included in military or police less-than-lethal arsenals because no drug is yet known {{that would be}} quickly and reliably effective on humans without the risks of side effects or an overdose. This means that effective use requires {{an estimate of the}} weight of the target to be able to determine how many darts (if any) can be used. Shooting too few would result in partial effects only, while too many can kill the target. According to James Butts, former Chief of Police of Santa Monica, [...] "Tranquilizing agents don't affect everyone uniformly. Therefore you cannot predict whether or not you have a sufficient dose to tranquilize the individual. Second, any <b>tranquillizer</b> will take time to enter the bloodstream and sedate the individual. If someone is advancing on you with a deadly weapon or a threatening object, there's no way a <b>tranquillizer</b> would take effect in the two to three seconds it would take someone to seriously injure you." ...|$|R

50|$|For {{thousands}} of years various tribal peoples have used poisoned arrows (for example tipped with Curare), to incapacitate animals before killing them, but the modern <b>tranquillizer</b> gun was invented only in the 1950s by New Zealander Colin Murdoch. While working with colleagues who were studying introduced wild goat and deer populations in New Zealand, Murdoch {{had the idea that}} the animals would be much easier to catch, examine, and release if a dose of <b>tranquillizer</b> could be administered by projection from afar. Murdoch went on to develop a range of rifles, darts, and pistols that have had an enormous impact on the treatment and study of animals around the world.|$|R

Tridofos was better than diazepam if demeanour in the anaes-thetic room, response to induction, and reflex responses are considered together, and it also had a better antisalivary effect. In the postoperative period both drugs were equally satisfactory in regard to freedom from drug-induced pallor or restlessness.
