5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world to read them without interruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with his brothers.|$|E

5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well.

30|$|The use of ‘services’ as {{the basic}} unit in the {{provision}} of access <b>to</b> <b>shared</b> <b>IT</b> systems and Internet-based applications is becoming more frequent, both because of the direct application of the concepts involved with the service-oriented computing (SOC) paradigm and because new and well-known applications are being made directly available over the Internet. One of the most interesting features of SOC is its ability to create new services out of existing ones, thus fostering the reuse of existing proven solutions.|$|R

25|$|The other {{potential}} {{shift in the}} linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its international role altogether, or come <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> {{with a number of}} equals.

25|$|Göring's {{logic in}} having an {{independent}} air force was militarily prudent {{but the future}} Reichsmarschall saw the new Luftwaffe as a power base and personal fiefdom {{as well as a}} crucial war weapon and consequently he was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with the navy. His views brought him into conflict with Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the navy. Göring loathed the navy and its Commander-in-Chief Raeder. In Göring's eyes, both Raeder and the navy represented the bourgeois clique of German society the National Socialist revolution had pledged to eliminate. During World War II their rivalry devolved into open hostility.|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people feel the need <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it.</b> It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E
