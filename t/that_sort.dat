However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

25|$|During Kenneth Williams' second {{appearance}} in 1973, the talk turned to politics, {{and particularly the}} Carry On star's trenchant views against trade unions. Williams accepted an invitation to return three weeks later and discuss these with trade unionist Jimmy Reid. The abrasive nature of their debate turned an entertainment show into something more akin to a serious current affairs programme, and the then Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, directed that the programme was not to venture into <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of territory again. However, Williams {{would become one of}} Parkinson's most celebrated guests, making a total of eight appearances over the years.|$|E

25|$|Where the IWW did win strikes, {{such as in}} Lawrence, {{they often}} {{found it hard to}} hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained {{collective}} bargaining agreements and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the shop floor. It proved difficult, however, to maintain <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees' resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers, so long as they would not undermine any strike.|$|E
25|$|In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order {{variable}} has {{a particular}} domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of <b>that</b> <b>sort.</b> Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that Gödel's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly {{used in the study}} of second-order arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E

Using Italian employer–employee panel data and quantile fixed-effects estimates, we point out <b>that</b> <b>sorting</b> matters and <b>that</b> its impact is not uniformly distributed along the wage distribution. Nonetheless, after controlling for the spatial sorting and endogeneity, we find an increasing impact of spatial externalities along the wage distribution. We also characterize the spatial sorting of workers across sectors and along the skills distribution. We point out <b>that</b> the spatial <b>sorting</b> is not homogeneous across sectors {{and that there is}} evidence supporting interpretation in terms of a dilating effect...|$|R

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1948, Wertham {{wrote and}} spoke widely, arguing about the {{detrimental}} effects that comics reading had on young people. Consequently, Seduction of the Innocent {{serves as a}} culminating expression of his sentiments about comics and presents augmented examples and arguments, rather than wholly new material. Wertham's concerns were not limited to comics' impact on boys: He also expressed {{a concern for the}} effect of impossibly proportioned female characters on girl readers. A. David Lewis writes that Wertham's anxiety over the perceived homosexual subtext of Batman and Robin was aimed at the welfare of a child introduced to <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of family unit, not on some inherent immorality of homosexuality. Will Brooker also points out in Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon that Wertham's notorious reading of Batman and Robin as a homosexual couple was not of his own invention, but was suggested to him by homosexual males whom he interviewed.|$|E
