5|$|The site reopened to {{the public}} on 1 July 2010. As well as {{presenting}} {{a history of the}} V-weapons and of the site, the museum enables visitors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels and a mock-up of the HDP gun. The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

It contains garden birds, a wren's nest and a tawny owl. This display plays birdsong recordings, which young children can learn quickly. This serves as an introduction to pishing.|$|E
25|$|The {{future of}} life on earth depends on our ability to take action. Many {{individuals}} {{are doing what they}} can, but real success can only come if there's a change in our societies and our economics and in our politics.

Surely {{we have a responsibility to}} leave for future generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the trial, Adams resigned from the National Health Service and was convicted in Lewes Crown Court on 26 July 1957, on eight counts of forging prescriptions, four counts of making false statements on cremation forms, and three offences under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951 and fined £2,400 plus costs of £457. His licence to prescribe dangerous drugs was revoked on 4 September and on 27 November he was struck off the Medical Register by the GMC. Adams continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his more loyal patients, and prescribed over-the-counter medicine to them.|$|E

25|$|Day/night cricket, {{also known}} as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under {{floodlights}} in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the marble floor. (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On {{the way to the}} campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E

500|$|Jean {{frequently}} {{appears on}} the Simpsons DVD audio commentaries for episodes which he has collaborated on. He told IGN that he enjoys doing them because he has not {{seen some of the}} episodes in ten to fifteen years, and [...] "it's kind of like a reunion <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the people that I worked with before, so it's a really pleasant experience." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{temporary}} interactive visitors center, {{dubbed the}} [...] "Discovery Channel Center" [...] was also constructed during the project. The center provided a simulated {{ride to the}} top of the monument, and shared information with visitors during phases in which the monument was closed. The majority of the project's phases were completed by summer 2000, allowing the monument to reopen July 31, 2000. The monument temporarily closed again on December 4, 2000 to allow a new elevator cab to be installed, completing the final phase of the restoration project. The new cab included glass windows, allowing visitors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the 194 memorial stones embedded in the monument's walls. The installation of the cab took much longer than anticipated, and the monument did not reopen until February 22, 2002. The final cost of the restoration project was $10.5 million.|$|E
500|$|... 1UP.com {{reviewer}} Jose Otero {{was critical}} of Halo 4s story, writing that {{the ending of the}} game [...] "doesn't make a lot of sense". He also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well, it was disappointing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the smaller story points were ignored entirely. Both G4 and Official Xbox Magazine agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise. [...] G4 reviewer, Adam Rosenburg, also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments, he was disappointed that composer Neil Davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games. [...] Michael Gapper of Computer and Video Games drew a comparison between Halo 4 and Halo 2. [...] He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted Halo 4s campaign, {{in the same way that}} they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for Halo 2 on the original Xbox. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in Halo 3s campaign. He found the spaces within the campaign to be narrow and constrained which led to a lack of tactical options in encounters.|$|E

500|$|Jelon Vieira and Lorel Machado brought capoeira to the United States in the 1970s. Throughout {{this decade}} Vieira taught capoeira {{workshops}} in New York City {{and started a}} capoeira performance company called Dance Brazil that toured across the United States. In Gerard Taylor's Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace (2005), master capoeira teacher Mestre Acordeon is quoted as saying: [...] "Demonstrations by Maestre Jelon [...] and Leromil Machado are {{considered by many to}} be responsible for the incorporation of capoeira movements into breakdancing." [...] Former Village Voice reporter Sally Banes and her colleague, photographer Martha Cooper, witnessed breaking in 1980 while covering Henry Chalfant's photography exhibit of subway graffiti. She wrote of the dance: [...] "Its spatial level called to mind capoeira, the spectacular Brazilian dance cum martial art form that incorporates kartwheels, kicks, and feints low to the ground, but the two were dissimilar enough in shape and timing that capoeira seemed at most only a distant relative, and certainly one the breakdancers weren't acquainted with—at least on a conscious level." [...] In his book Hip Hop Had a Dream (2008), Damien Morgan states: [...] "Breakdancing can have its origins in capoeira, because it does not focus on injuring the opponent; it rather emphasizes skill towards your opponent, to express yourself away from violence... in most cases, it is blatantly obvious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Breakdancing's foundations in Capoeira." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Grotesque" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A− {{and noted that}} while the episode is [...] "ponderous and pretentious", {{this aspect of the}} entry turns it into [...] "a benefit". VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "here's the thing: 'Grotesque' is absolutely [...] self-serious, just as much as I feared it would be. It also, unquestionably, works. The reason it works is very simple: It's pretty scary". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a largely positive review, awarding it an 8 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this is a solid effort by Howard Gordon. It’s good <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the methods that earned Mulder his nickname, and the underlying dynamic between Mulder and Scully is very well played. The central premise is vague enough to fall {{within the confines of the}} unusual, if not necessarily paranormal, and the supporting cinematography and score rise to the occasion." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, and praised the themes of the episode, writing that, [...] "Because 'Grotesque' certainly surprises, and shocks, and even appals —this is the closest The X-Files ever gets to staring into the face of insanity." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Duchovny's acting, calling it [...] "his best performance yet seen in the series". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "one of [...] darkest ever" [...] and called it [...] "a triumph for director Manners, cinematographer Bartley, and The X-Files art department." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's closing monologue, noting that [...] " [...] spells out what the camera is saying a hundred times more effectively with its finale shot of a pairing of a gargoyle." [...] Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described [...] "Grotesque" [...] as a [...] "deep, dark, twisted psychological moment for The X-Files that I absolutely love" [...] and included it in the [...] "5 Episodes [...] That Could Be Made Into Movies" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E

His decision to remodel his own home may date from this period. In 1794, following his service as the first U.S. Secretary of State (1790–1793), Jefferson began rebuilding his house based on the ideas he had acquired in Europe. The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency (1801–1809). [...] Although generally completed by 1809, Jefferson continued work on the present structure until his death in 1826.|$|E
