These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E

5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage {{is the most}} productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of large volumes of predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas to erupt during the pre-explosive phase suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. <b>Two</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E

The first of <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights as the air force tested the type's technical characteristics, which were assessed {{by the end of that}} year to have generally complied with requirements. Of the batch of six production aircraft that were handed over in December 2012, five flew to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky where the aircraft would, in February 2013, start the second stage of the trials. This stage, which was scheduled to last eighteen months, would focus on the Su-35's weapons and manoeuvrability in combat.|$|E
