50|$|In short, their {{attention}} had been irresistibly {{called to the}} subject of the Scottish Reformation, and the principles upon which their church had been founded, and to the inquiry as to whether these principles were still in operation, or hastening to become a mere dead letter. And this inquiry was neither unnecessary nor in vain. A death-blow was struck at that Erastianism which had lately become so predominant in the Church of Scotland; and such was the spirit of research among the mouldering records of its long-neglected library, and the ardour with <b>which</b> they <b>were</b> published and diffused, that the former ignorance and indifference could be tolerated no longer. These effects went on from year to year, and their result we know.

5000|$|Positive results dialogues {{have been}} {{reciprocal}} visits and regular {{correspondence between the}} Pope and the Patriarchs, frequent contacts at the local church level and - importantly for the strongly monastic Oriental Churches - {{at the level of}} the monasteries. [...] Several meetings between Popes and Patriarchs took place since the Vatican Council. In their Common Declaration of Pope John Paul II and the Ecumenical Patriarch His Holiness Bartholomew I (July 1, 2004), they agree that in the search for full communion, it would have been unrealistic not to expect obstacles of various kinds. They identify doctrine, but mainly the conditioning by a troubled history. New problems emerged from the radical changes in the East. The dialogue was made more and not less difficult after the fall of communism. The Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and all the Orthodox Churches produced three between 1980 and 1990, which show a deep community in the understanding of faith, church and sacraments. Mariology and Marian issues were not even addressed in any of the joint documents, because mariological differences are seen as minor. The only seriously debated theological issue, besides the [...] "Filioque"-clause in <b>the</b> <b>Creed,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> still a motive of separation for most Orthodox, is the question of Roman primacy, the role of the pontiff.|$|R

In spite of the agreement reached at the council of 325 the Arians who had been defeated dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favored them.|$|R

5000|$|According to Iran's {{religious}} leader and <b>the</b> Deobandi <b>creed,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a <b>creed</b> especially followed by patriarchal Pashtun tribes, {{the status of}} being a Sayyid can only be attributed through the patrilineal lineage.

The Persian notation [...] "Mirza", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a derivation of the word [...] "Mirzada" [...] i.e. Son of a [...] "Mir" [...] has various meanings. One of the meanings of [...] "Mir" [...] is a Sayyid leader of a Sayyid branch or community, simultaneously being a religious Islamic scholar. Thus, a Sayyid of patrilineal lineage, being the son of a Mir can also be called [...] "Mirza".

Those green boughs, the hymn and anthem never heard but at Christmas--even <b>the</b> Athanasian <b>Creed,</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> discriminated from <b>the</b> others only as being longer and of exceptional virtue, since it was only read on rare occasions--brought a vague exulting sense, for which the grown men could as little have found words as the children, that something great and mysterious had been done for them in heaven above and in earth below, <b>which</b> they <b>were</b> appropriating by their presence. And then the red faces made their way through the black biting frost to their own homes, feeling themselves free for the rest of the day to eat, drink, and be merry, and using that Christian freedom without diffidence.|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, Miss Waddington hardly knew what answer to give him. He was one, it seemed, who, having spoken with {{decision}} himself, would take any answer as decisive. He was one {{not to be}} tampered with, and one also hardly to be rejected without consideration; and certainly not so to be accepted. She had liked him much--very much, considering the little she had known of him. She had even asked herself, half playfully, whether it were not possible that she might learn to love him. He was a gentleman, and that with her was much. He {{was a man of}} talent, and that with her was more. He was one whose character and mode of thought she could respect. He was a man whom any woman might probably be able to respect. But Caroline Waddington wanted much more than this in her future lord. She could talk pleasantly of the probability of her marrying a country parson; but she had, in truth, a much wider ambition for herself. She would never marry--such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creed</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> to govern her own life--without love; but she would not allow herself to love where love would interfere with her high hopes. In her catalogue of human blisses love in a cottage was not entered. She was not avaricious; she did not look to money as the summum bonum;--certainly not to marry for money's sake. But she knew that no figure in the world could be made without means. Her own fortune was small, and she did not even rate her beauty high. Her birth was the birth of a lady, but that was all; her talents had never been tried, but she thought of them more indifferently than they deserved. She felt, therefore, that she had no just ground to hope for much; but she was determined that no folly on her own part should rob her of any chance that fortune might vouchsafe to her.|$|R
5000|$|Acesius was {{a bishop}} of Constantinople, in {{the reign of}} Constantine. He was a disciple of Novatus, the founder of Novatianism, whose {{distinguishing}} doctrine was, that those who had fallen from the faith in time of persecution, or who after baptism had committed any mortal sin, {{were not to be}} admitted to the communion of the church, even if they gave evidence of sincere repentance. At the First Council of Nicaea, in 325, Constantine inquired of Acesius, whom, though separated from the communion of the church, he had invited to the council, about the ground of his separation. Acesius, in reply, admitted that <b>the</b> <b>creed</b> <b>which</b> had <b>been</b> subscribed by the synod was orthodox, and assented to their determination concerning the festival of Easter, but pleaded, as a sufficient reason for separation, the Novatian doctrine, which would not permit them to hold communion with those, who, in persecution under Decius, had forsaken the church. It was then that Constantine said, [...] "Acesius, take a ladder, and climb up to heaven alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{same general}} {{characteristic}} of sympathy amounting to reverence marks Bret Harte's humour in his better-known class of works, the short stories. He {{does not make}} his characters absurd {{in order to make}} them contemptible: it might almost be said that he makes them absurd in order to make them dignified. For example, the greatest creation of Bret Harte, greater even than Colonel Starbottle (and how terrible it is to speak of anyone greater than Colonel Starbottle!) is that unutterable being who goes by the name of Yuba Bill. He is, of course, the coach-driver in the Bret Harte district. Some ingenious person, whose remarks I read the other day, had compared him on this ground with old Mr. Weller. It would be difficult to find a comparison indicating a more completely futile instinct for literature. Tony Weller and Yuba Bill were both coach-drivers, and this fact establishes a resemblance just about as much as the fact that Jobson in [...] "Rob Roy" [...] and George Warrington in [...] "Pendennis" [...] were both lawyers; or that Antonio and Mr. Pickwick were both merchants; or that Sir Galahad and Sir Willoughby Patten were both knights. Tony Weller is a magnificent grotesque. He is a gargoyle, and his mouth, like the mouths of so many gargoyles, is always open. He is garrulous, exuberant, flowery, preposterously sociable. He holds that great <b>creed</b> of <b>the</b> convivial, <b>the</b> <b>creed</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> back of so much that is greatest in Dickens, <b>the</b> <b>creed</b> that eternity begins at ten o'clock at night, and that nights last forever. But Yuba Bill is a figure of a widely different character. He is not convivial; it might almost be said that he is too great ever to be sociable. A circle of quiescence and solitude such as that which might ring a saint or a hermit rings this majestic and profound humourist. His jokes do not flow upon him like those of Mr. Weller, sparkling, continual, and deliberate, like the play of a fountain in a pleasure garden; they fall suddenly and capriciously, like a crash of avalanches from a great mountain. Tony Weller has the noisy humour of London, Yuba Bill has the silent humour of the earth.|$|R
