40|$|The ATLAS Barrel Toroid (BT) {{consists}} of 8 superconducting coils of 25 m length and 5 m width. Each coil {{is equipped with}} eight titanium alloy <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> acting as support for the magnetic forces, the intensity {{of which will be}} up to 180 t for the most loaded one.

The initial aim was to verify the amount of stick and slip, the possibility of it occurring during the excitation and the flexion of the support at the anchoring point on the magnet. This was achieved by inducing in the support the same movements foreseen during the cool-down and the excitation of the magnet and loading with the same forces.

50|$|The 27.1 m high, {{hexagonal}} {{ridge turret}} {{is made of}} oak, and a masterpiece of carpenter technology, towering above the roof ridge, {{at the same height}} as the walls of the choir. The dendrochronological analysis show that the belfry construction was done in 1475, which has arisen in the supporting structure of the choir, that was added in 1496. The roof shingles of the open belfry and the hexagonal pointed helmet have been applied in several layers on the wooden formwork. The latest dendrochronological provisions on wooden spire show that this wood was hit in 1628, and the roof turret was built in 1629, followed by several repairs. The bracing cross pieces of the lower frame structure are applied, while there are {{at the top of the}} cross pieces of wood mortise and tenon joints. The pediments over the open belfry are crowned with golden knobs, and the roof spouts are decorated with Gargoyles from painted copper sheets. The subsequent installation of two <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> was done <b>in</b> 1778, and included the removal of the shingle at the bottom of the screen for the installation of <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>in</b> order to stabilize the pointed helmet.

40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> <b>in</b> the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, {{subject to}} monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks <b>in</b> the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling <b>in</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation <b>in</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present <b>in</b> the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The position of the cracks <b>in</b> the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|R

The diaphragm arch-rocking collapse mechanism is studied referring to the limit analysis approach, taking into account the phenomena involved, such as the buttress action of the abutments and the confining action of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The analytical evaluation of the collapse multiplier in the case of either over- resisting or weak ties is proposed. The analytical model is validated by comparison with the experimental behavior of an arch-to-abutment structure subjected to rocking.

During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends from outer factors for a long time.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A failure {{analysis}} investigation was completed on the trashracks at Powerhouse One of Rock Island Dam. The investigation {{was part of}} the overall condition assessment and rehabilitation work being performed at the dam. The trashracks were deemed a faulty system in 2005 when MWH, a contractor for Chelan County PUD, initially inspected the racks. Building on the original work completed by MWH, this project compiled background information and conducted field inspections to evaluate the future reliability of the trashracks. The field inspections identified consistent failures of the diagonal <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> discovered cracks <b>in</b> the rackbar welds, and highlighted the noticeable presence of corrosion damage. Though localized failures were identified, a static analysis concluded that the overall structural design was adequate for continued operations. Field tests and a finite element model were compared in a dynamic analysis to ensure the vibration induced stresses did not reach the allowable limit. Ultimately, the trashracks received new diagonal braces constructed from angle iron to replace the failing <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Damaged welds, caused by the propagation of cracks from welding defects, were repaired and the racks were sandblasted to remove corrosion debris and repainted to prevent future degradation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> or Track rods are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system.

50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> arc will change. It will then require a change <b>in</b> the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel {{in relation to the}} control arms.|$|R
