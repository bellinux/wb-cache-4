40|$|Abstract The term "Geographic Information Systems" (GIS) {{has been}} added <b>to</b> <b>MeSH</b> <b>in</b> 2003, a step {{reflecting}} the importance and growing use of GIS in health and healthcare research and practices. GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e. g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The {{ultimate goal is to}} illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e. g., European Union) and global levels. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Offset Compound Gear Drive is an in-line, discrete, {{two-speed}} device {{utilizing a}} special offset compound gear that has both an internal tooth configuration on the input end and external tooth configuration on the output end, thus allowing it <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> series, simultaneously, {{with both a}} smaller external tooth input gear and a larger internal tooth output gear. This unique geometry and offset axis permits the compound gear to mesh with the smaller diameter input gear and the larger diameter output gear, {{both of which are}} on the same central, or primary, centerline. This configuration results in a compact in-line reduction gear set consisting of fewer gears and bearings than a conventional planetary gear train. Switching between the two output ratios is accomplished through a main control clutch and sprag. Power flow to the above is transmitted through concentric power paths. Low-speed operation is accomplished in two meshes. For the purpose of illustrating the low-speed output operation, the following example pitch diameters are given. A 5. 0 pitch diameter (PD) input gear to 7. 50 PD (internal tooth) intermediate gear (0. 667 reduction mesh), and a 7. 50 PD (external tooth) intermediate gear to a 10. 00 PD output gear (0. 750 reduction mesh). Note that it is not required that the intermediate gears on the offset axis be of the same diameter. For this example, the resultant low-speed ratio is 2 : 1 (output speed = 0. 500; product of stage one 0. 667 reduction and stage two 0. 750 stage reduction). The design is not restricted to the example pitch diameters, or output ratio. From the output gear, power is transmitted through a hollow drive shaft, which, in turn, drives a sprag during which time the main clutch is disengaged...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The University of Wollongong in {{collaboration}} with the Australian coal mining industry has shown that a viable polymer-based alternative <b>to</b> steel <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> underground roadway support applications can be developed to eliminate the use and handling of steel mesh. The feasibility of developing polymeric alternatives <b>to</b> steel <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> underground roadway support applications has been established, the physical and material constraints to be endured by any new polymeric skin reinforcement system have been identified by measuring the mechanical properties of steel mesh, and materials that can be spray-applied have been identified. The study has also shown that polymer mechanical properties can be optimised to produce similar mechanical properties (modulus, yield stress, elongation-at-break etc) <b>to</b> steel <b>mesh.</b> The identified materials will allow the face support cycle to be fully automated, or at least remotely operated and installed, enabling the removal of personnel from the immediate face area, thus contributing to a projected substantial improvement in underground roadway development rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} mesh is used to {{decompose}} a continuous domain into a discretized representation. The finite element method solves PDEs on this mesh by modeling complex functions {{as a set of}} simple basis functions with coefficients at mesh vertices and prescribed continuity between elements. The mesh is one of the fundamental types of data linking the various tools in the FEA process (mesh generation, analysis, visualization, etc.). Thus, the representation of mesh data and operations on those data play a very important role in FEA-based simulations. MOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data. MOAB can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in the finite element 'zoo'. The functional interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata commonly found on the mesh. MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space and time, based on access <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> chunks rather than through individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity access. The MOAB data model consists of a mesh interface instance, mesh entities (vertices and elements), sets, and tags. Entities are addressed through handles rather than pointers, to allow the underlying representation of an entity to change without changing the handle to that entity. Sets are arbitrary groupings of mesh entities and other sets. Sets also support parent/child relationships as a relation distinct from sets containing other sets. The directed-graph provided by set parent/child relationships is useful for modeling topological relations from a geometric model or other metadata. Tags are named data which can be assigned to the mesh as a whole, individual entities, or sets. Tags are a mechanism for attaching data to individual entities and sets are a mechanism for describing relations between entities; the combination of these two mechanisms is a powerful yet simple interface for representing metadata or application-specific data. For example, sets and tags can be used together to describe geometric topology, boundary condition, and inter-processor interface groupings in a mesh. MOAB is used in several ways in various applications. MOAB serves as the underlying mesh data representation in the VERDE mesh verification code. MOAB can also be used as a mesh input mechanism, using mesh readers included with MOAB, or as a translator between mesh formats, using readers and writers included with MOAB. The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section 2, 'Getting Started', provides a few simple examples of using MOAB to perform simple tasks on a mesh. Section 3 discusses the MOAB data model in more detail, including some aspects of the implementation. Section 4 summarizes the MOAB function API. Section 5 describes some of the tools included with MOAB, and the implementation of mesh readers/writers for MOAB. Section 6 contains a brief description of MOAB's relation to the TSTT mesh interface. Section 7 gives a conclusion and future plans for MOAB development. Section 8 gives references cited in this report. A reference description of the full MOAB API is contained in Section 9...|$|E
