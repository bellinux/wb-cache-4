50|$|Learning {{from the}} {{experience}} of its first year, VAM offered a substantially changed and updated Lerma model for 1982. In the exterior, the squared grid grille design divided in rectangles was replaced by an all-new totally chromed metal grille with a simple design of thin horizontal stripes with equally thin spaces between them. The headlight bezels were completely blacked out in their internal parts with only their external surrounding portions retaining a chromed appearance. The front parking lights were changed from transparent to amber. Both bumpers received AMC's Eagle thick nerfing strip design with a central bright molding and new VAM-designed plain smooth bumper end caps continuing the bright molding on their upper portions. On both sides, changes were more noticeable. The bright molding on the rocker panels was deleted and new moldings with a six horizontal stripe pattern were fitted to the bottom edges of the front fenders, doors and sides. The wheel lip and drip rail bright moldings remained unchanged while new additional bright moldings appeared in the form of units one the bases of the door and side glass areas as well as new bright moldings for the internal part of the door and side window frames. The <b>trim</b> <b>plate</b> between the side glass (two-door model) or between the rear door and side glass (four-door model) was changed in favor of a new plate following the same six striped pattern as the low side moldings. This plate existed only in the two-door model in 1981 but it was present in both body styles for 1982. The small angular mid side window of the 1981 two-door model was replaced by the normal unit used since the two-door AMC Hornet and two-door AMC Concord base models. The five-spoke VAM wheels with Noryl-type wheelcovers were replaced by new aluminum wheels with chromed volcano centercaps and lug nuts. All of these changes resulted in a highly different Lerma model that looked fairly more luxurious on the outside compared to smoothness of the 1981 version.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional culture systems {{bridge the}} {{experimental}} gap between in vivo and in vitro physiology. However, nonstandardized formation and limited downstream adaptability of 3 D cultures have hindered mainstream adoption {{of these systems}} for biological applications, especially for low- and moderate-throughput assays commonly used in biomedical research. Here we build on our recent development of a 384 -well hanging drop plate for spheroid culture to design a complementary spheroid transfer and imaging (<b>TRIM)</b> <b>plate.</b> The low-aspect ratio wells of the <b>TRIM</b> <b>plate</b> facilitated high-fidelity, user-independent, contact-based collection of hanging drop spheroids. Using the <b>TRIM</b> <b>plate,</b> we demonstrated several downstream analyses, including bulk tissue collection for flow cytometry, high-resolution low working-distance immersion imaging, and timely reagent delivery for enzymatic studies. Low working-distance multiphoton imaging revealed a cell type-dependent, macroscopic spheroid structure. Unlike ovarian cancer spheroids, which formed loose, disk-shaped spheroids, human mammary fibroblasts formed tight, spherical, and nutrient-limited spheroids. Beyond the applications we describe here, we expect the hanging drop spheroid plate and complementary <b>TRIM</b> <b>plate</b> to facilitate analyses of spheroids across the spectrum of throughput, particularly for bulk collection of spheroids and high-content imaging. open...|$|E

2500|$|Built in 1930, and {{considered}} the architectural centerpiece of the district, the neoclassical building is named for the university's second president Dr. James B. Dudley. The Dudley Building was designed by noted North Carolina architect Charles C. Hartmann, this building was erected {{on the site of}} the former Administrative building, which was built in 1893 and destroyed by fire in 1930. The building originally housed the college's administrative offices, in addition to an auditorium and library on the main and top levels respectively. Today the Dudley building houses the University art galleries on the main floor. The 29,058 square foot building features 2 floors in addition to a fully raised basement level. A distinctive feature of this building is its use of stone. This building features more stone application than any other building on the university's campus. The building also features a broad sweep of fifteen steeps to the main entrance, smooth-face blocks defining a five-bay entrance, intricately carved lintels and acroteria, full classical entablature, splayed arches with keystones over the eight-over-twelve sash windows, and a hexastyle portico with an incised frieze.

40|$|The vibro-acoustic {{behaviour}} {{of structures}} coupled with poroelastic trims and fluid cavities can be predicted {{by means of}} the Patch Transfer Function (PTF) approach. The PTF is a sub-structuring procedure that allows to couple different sub-systems via impedance relations determined at their common interfaces. The coupling surfaces are discretised into elementary areas called patches. Since the patch impedances can be determined in either computational or experimental manner, the PTF approach offers high degrees of modularity. For sub-systems, which allow for an efficient numerical characterisation, simulation schemes should be adopted, whereas for sub-systems, which involve highly complex models, measurements might offer a cost-efficient alternative. In {{the first part of the}} work the PTF approach is presented. Next, the sampling criterion for the PTF description of the vibratory field and sound radiation from structures is discussed. When studying the sound radiating from vibrating structures the surface is discretised into elemental areas also referred to as patches. Here the special case of a simply supported baffled plate excited by a broadband point force is considered. It is shown that accurate approximation of the radiated power may be obtained well beyond the frequency limit imposed by the structural Nyquist sampling criterion, provided the complex-valued vibration field is averaged over each patch. This is due to the fact that the averaging process not only reduces the structural velocity but simultaneously determines an increased radiation efficiency. An analytical expression is provided allowing the optimisation of the patch size given a desired accuracy level for the assessment of the radiated power. In the third part of the work a novel PTF-based experimental method for the charac- terisation of poroelastic materials is proposed. The novelty of the methodology proposed consists in the fact that the trim characterisation no longer relies on a material micro- model (i. e. Biot), whose parameters are often difficult to be acquired. The specimen is considered as a single component, therefore no separation of layers is necessary. An air layer correction for surface impedance measurement is discussed. Finally, the PTF approach proposed has been applied on a laboratory test case, consisting of a <b>trimmed</b> <b>plate</b> coupled to a rigid acoustic cavity. The PTF reconstruction has been successfully validated through a measurement conducted on the fully assembled system...|$|R

40|$|South Africans {{frequently}} consume {{red meat}} {{as part of}} their diet. However the nutrient content of South African sheep meat is derived from other countries. The Red Meat Industry considered it essential to have more reliable data and thus the nutrient content of A 2 South African lamb was recently determined and published. This is the next phase of the study in which the right sides of C 2 mutton carcasses were used to determine the nutrient and physical (carcass) composition of each raw cut as well as the whole carcass by calculation. Eighteen mutton carcasses of the most commonly consumed breeds, namely Dorper and Merino, in South Africa were selected. The carcasses were obtained from large abattoirs form three mutton producing regions in South Africa namely Ermelo, the Karoo and Kalahari. Chilled carcass sides were subdivided into ten primal cuts. Three cuts (shoulder, loin and leg) from the left side were cooked {{in order to determine the}} nutrient composition thereof. The cuts were dissected into meat which consists of muscle and intramuscular fat, intermuscular - plus subcutaneous fat and bone in order to determine the physical composition per cut and for the whole carcass. Meat compromise of 63. 2 % of the carcass, with bone contributing to 20. 5 % and fat to 16. 9 %. Results showed differences in the physical composition of South African C 2 mutton as it contains on average 47 % less fat and 19 % more lean muscle, when compared to previous published composition data. Three cuts (shoulder, loin and leg) from the left side were cooked in order to determine the nutrient composition thereof. Cooking resulted in an increase in the protein and cholesterol concentrations of the cooked cuts. Iron content was higher in the cooked loin and leg but decreased in the cooked shoulder. According to nutrient density, a 100 g edible portion of the leg, loin and shoulder have a nutrient density higher than one for protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B 12 indicating that these cuts are a good source of these specific nutrients. A 100 g edible portion of the loin cut contained higher fat quantities than the cooked shoulder and leg cuts. The loin cut also had a higher cholesterol content at 70. 8 mg compared the 58. 5 mg cholesterol content in the shoulder and 57. 9 mg in the leg cut. However, these values were calculated with all associated subcutaneous fat and it is known that many consumers <b>trim</b> on <b>plate,</b> especially the loin cut. Considering the fact that significant differences were apparent between the current study and previous data derived from other countries, it emphasizes the importance of determining the nutrient composition of South African food products in order to increase the validity of the SA food composition tables. Food-based approaches targeting the relief of micronutrient deficiency usually encourage the consumption of animal foods together with the consumption of green leafy vegetables (GLV). The inclusion of GLV and red meat, two micronutrient rich foods, can be a strategy based on mutual supplementation to combat nutritional deficiencies as it has the potential to alleviate numerous micronutrient deficiencies including iron and vitamin A deficiency.

Earlier prints bear Giovanni Giacomo de' Rossi's imprint, later prints that of his successor Domenico de' Rossi. Most plates include cardinal's forename and surname, office held, date of creation, coat of arms of reigning pope at creation, cardinal's family arms, and often his native city or country. Plates of cardinals created by Innocent XI and earlier generally have been altered to include death date. The shoulder-length portraits of 200 cardinals in oval frames were issued in the de' Rossi publication Libro de' ritratti degli eminentissimi signori cardinali, dall' anno MDCLVIII nel pontificato di Alessandro VII sino al presente. Begun in March of 1657, it was updated over time as new cardinals were created and old plates needed to be reworked or replaced. See Grelle Iusco. Mounted on leaf [2] is Claude Mellan's bust-length engraved author portrait of Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio', for his Della guerra di Fiandra, first published in Cologne, 1632 (trimmed to platemark). Present print appears to be consistent with those from Cologne editions, but copies were made for editions in other languages. See Préaud. The first two leaves in volume are earlier prints of cardinals that were not published by the de' Rossi. Mounted on leaf [1] is an unsigned, shoulder-length engraved portrait of Albrecht VII, Archduke of Austria, dressed as a cardinal (sheet trimmed to 23. 4 x 13. 7 cm); he was made cardinal in 1577. Beneath image is an 8 -line laudatory epigram in Latin by Laurentius Beyerlinck, containing a chronogram for 1596. It is followed by imprint: Romae : Nicolo van Aelst formis, 1596. Printmakers include: Jean-Charles Allet, Robert van Audenaerd, Bernardino Balduini, Barend de Bailliu, Jacques Blondeau, A. Calabrese, Albert Clouet, Guillaume Courtois, Lodovico David, Giuseppe de Angelis, Girolamo de' Rossi, François Desportes, Nicolas Dorigny, Benoît Farjat, Giovanni Battista Gaulli, Gottfried Kniller, Antonio Lesma, Marco Mangani, Giovanni Domenico Mattei, Carlo Maratti, Pier Francesco Mola, Giovanni Maria Morandi, Pietro Martire Neri, Giuseppe Passeri, Etienne Picart, Domenico Piola, Domenico Rainaldi, Giusto Sertemanni, Giuseppe Maria Testana, Benoît Thiboust, Girolamo Troppa, Guillaume Vallet, Ferdinand Voet, and Arnold van Westerhout. Volume also includes 4 prints from the de Rossi series of papal portraits: Clement IX, Alexander VIII (engraved by Arnold van Westerhout and, exceptionally, sold by him rather than by the de' Rossi), Innocent XII, Clement XI. Portrait of Innocent XII is followed by title leaf for a portrait series of cardinals created by Innocent on 22 July 1697; it bears Domenico de' Rossi's imprint. Fifteen portraits of cardinals, all of them creations of Alexander VII, have been <b>trimmed</b> within the <b>plate</b> mark to about 19 x 14. 5 cm and mounted on full-sized leaves. In these (perhaps earlier) prints the cardinal's date of creation appeared in the upper margin, the imprint in the lower margin. Both these areas have been trimmed away, and the missing creation dates supplied by hand in brown ink. BN. Estampes IFF. 17 e s.,Grelle Iusco, A.

40|$|Con el advenimiento de las técnicas de cementación indirecta, resulta importante determinar cual de ellas es la mas precisa respecto a la no modificación o alteración en la posición {{tridimensional}} de los brackets, tendientes a garantizar una expresión real de los valores de inclinación y de torque propuestos para una formulación en particular; sin que se ven afectados los objetivos del tratamiento por una inadecuada ubicación o por variables que afecten la estabilidad dimensional del medio de transferencia que se utilice para el montaje. Por lo anterior el objetivo del presente estudio es evaluar la precisión de dos técnicas de transferencia para la cementación indirecta de brackets preajustados. Para tal fin se compararon dos técnicas de cementación indirecta descritas a continuación; La primera técnica (grupo 1 – 6 modelos) consistió de 2 placas termo formables elaboradas al vacío: la primera es una lámina de caucho flexible de 0. 4 mm de espesor que contacta íntimamente la placa; y la segunda es una placa mas rígida CLEAR ADVANTAGE series I, Ortho technology, de 0. 4 mm de espesor. La segunda técnica (grupo 2 – 6 modelos) requirió de la aplicación por la cara vestibular del modelo, incluyendo los Brackets, de una silicona PVS transparente Memosil ™ de Heraeus Kulzer, Alemania. Una vez polimerizada la silicona, se procedio a elaborar una placa al vacio rigida CLEAR ADVANTAGE series I, Ortho technology, de 0. 4 de espesor para hacer la transferencia. Los dos métodos de transferencia evaluados tuvieron globalmente un comportamiento similar, sin diferencias de peso estadístico a favor de alguno de ellos. Sin embargo al hacer un análisis posicional detallado se observaron cambios notables en la ubicación final de los brackets en el grupo de la doble placa, contrastando con las mediciones encontradas para el grupo de silicona y placa, las cuales se comportaron de manera mas homogeneaAbstract. With {{the advent}} of techniques for indirect cementation in orthodontics, {{it is important to}} determine which one is the most accurate and reliable in the three-dimensional positioning of the brackets, in order to ensure genuine expression of the values of tip and proposed torque for a particular formulation; affected without treatment goals by improper location or variables affecting the dimensional stability of the transfer medium that is used for mounting; regarding this process the objectives of present study are: - Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of two techniques of cementing indirect preadjusted brackets. - Determine which of the two methods of transfer is more dimensionally stable to ensure proper position of the preadjusted brackets - Evaluate the operator's ability to place the brackets preadjusted in the same position at different times from the same patient. Materials and methods: A rubber mold ORT 1006 is used 28 (ideal Occlusion) house Nissin Dental Products INC (Kyoto, Japan) in order to make emptying in acrylic, 20 accurate models (10 upper and 10 lower). Master Series preadjusted brackets System, Technical MBT slot 0. 022 (American Orthodontics, USA) for upper and lower jaw (5 to 5) and direct cementation tubes for first upper and lower molars (American Orthodontics, USA) were positioned. The method of adhesion of the brackets to the model, will be held following the methodology described by White in 2002, using a water soluble adhesive (Aleenes's Tacky Glue, USA). Once positioned the brackets, proceed to capture digital images using 3 D laser scanner processing laboratory models of American Orthodontics in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (USA), for Harmony Custom System. The procedure will be performed following the standard to minimize errors in radius and distance between centers and archives will be obtained in. stl format protocol. Subsequently transfer buckets customized for each of the two techniques to assess were manufactured: • The first technique consists of 2 plates thermos vacuum formable made: the first is a flexible rubber sheet 0. 4 mm thick intimately contacting plate; and the second is a more rigid plate Essix C + 0. 6 mm thick which is empty on the above, in order to give more rigidity to the transfer system. • The second technique requires the application by the vestibular face of the model, including the brackets, a transparent PVS Memosil Heraeus Kulzer ™ silicone, Germany. Once polymerized silicone, we will proceed to develop a rigid vacuum plate Essix C + 0. 6 mm thick to make the transfer. Once obtained the transfer <b>plates,</b> <b>trimmed</b> and adapted the model that will serve for assembly (the same previously scanned with brackets in position). To prepare this model, it was washed with hot water and stiff brush; it dried and subsequently Sandblast the labial surface to improve adhesion of the resin. After washing and drying again the model is applied to the bracket and the vestibular acrylic surface model liquid resin Assure Plus (liquid resin multipurpose increase adhesion acrylic) following the manufacturer's instructions (Reliance Orthodontic Products, Inc., USA). Subsequently nano-hybrid resin fluid Flow Grandio (VOCO, Germany) was applied {{to the base of the}} bracket and the bucket to settle in the model. For both types of plates transfer is perform photocuring using an LED light-curing. VALO (Ultradent, USA). Once polymerized resin, proceed to remove the transfer buckets of the first technique; and transfer tray and silicone to the second technique. Models with the brackets will again be scanned using the same 3 D scanner Orthodontic processing laboratory models of American Orthodontics. The data obtained were evaluated by superimposing the images obtained so as to evaluate the precision in placing the brackets operator, and the accuracy of the transfer method of indirect mounting cubettes. To this end, the program Geomagic Qualify 12. 1. 2, used in engineering for CAD analysis and 3 D metrology is used. This program allows you to completely choose the parameters they want to study when making the comparison. By achieving establish which of the two indirect cementation techniques is more accurate and reliable, it is possible to recommend a clinical protocol with the advantages of indirect mounting ensures ideal positioning of brackets preset in the three planes of spac...|$|R
