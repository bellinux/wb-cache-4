5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E

5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E

5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason {{to do business with}} the people of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to be of interest to the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. <b>To</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E

5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> {{he would win}} the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both {{formally}} withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars.

If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors will be required <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered.

The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E
5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E
5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in the}} cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E

5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell Waller, a black Virginia {{sharecropper}} sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated Waller in a settlement and as their argument grew more heated, Waller had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> the trial was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price to commute the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. Waller was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E
