50|$|As is true {{throughout}} oncology (the {{study of}} tumors, malignant and benign), the nomenclature for these tumors continually evolves {{on the basis}} of threads of consensus in the scientific literature regarding the tumors' classification (which is based on shared embryologic origins, clinicopathologic characteristics, and so on). As science advances, more is understood about how one can differentiate tumors that formerly seemed alike. For example, the scientific knowledge of tumor markers, genomics, and proteomics regularly advances. In this environment, tumor names may slip over the years between synonymity, hyponymy and hypernymy, and deprecation. Some terms that have been synonymous with teratoma include dysembryoma, <b>teratoblastoma,</b> organoid tumor, and teratoid tumor.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an immunoeiectrophoretic method for alpha-fetoprotein quantitation. The {{sensitivity of the}} method, which is easy to perform in the routine laboratory, is under the best conditions 50 zg/Iiter, but 83 ig/Iiter can always be detected. With this test, sera from patients with various hepatic diseases and from pregnancies can be tested. AddftlonalKeyphrases: liver disease. cancer. terato-blastoma Determination of serum aipha-fetoprotein (AFP) is useful in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (1 - 3) and embryonal <b>teratoblastoma</b> (4, 5). The need for AFP quantitation has been stressed (6 - 9) for follow up of patients who {{may be expected to}} have an increased in-cidence of primary hepatocellular cancer, for bio-chemical surveillance of patients with hepatomas subjected to chemotherapy or liver resection, and for evaluating severity of liver destruction and regeneration in acute hepatitis. Modifications in the concentration of AFP have been described in maternal serum and amniotic fluid in the presence of abnormal pregnancies and fetal neural-tube defects (10 - 12). Here we {{describe an}} immunoelectrophoretic method for AFP quantitation with which we can detect as little as 50 zg of the protein per liter under the best electro-phoretic conditions; under ordinary conditions, 83 ag/liter can always be detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is {{a disease}} connected with the inactivation of AR due to a mutation that inactivate male sexual differentiation, and causes a spectrum of phenotypic anomalies having as a common aspect the loss of reproductive characteristics. In this paper the clinical, endocrinological and molecular features of three patients are reported. The first case concerns a 17 years old patient, the second an infant suffering from inguinal hernia that has been surgically corrected when he was 3 months old and finally the third case concerns a 57 years old woman. All the subjects had a common primary amenorrhea and a following pelvic echography highlighted the absence of internal genital organs {{and the presence of}} a dead-end vagina. All the patients are characterized by a normal male karyotype and present on the short arm of the Y chromosome the SRY gene. Moreover, FISH revealed the presence of androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome and the SRY gene on the Y one. The automatic sequencing of the genes for the androgen receptor (AR) shows that each subject has a mutation in the gene for the androgen receptor (AR). These mutations are associated with complete androgen insensivity syndrome (CAIS). All the cases of study exhibited a negative family history for CAIS. This study confirms the need to perform a pelvic examination by means of echography in pre-pubertal and pubertal age to highlight the normality of the internal genitalia (uterus and ovaries). If a primary amenorrhea is checked, the karyotyping is compulsory. If a Morris's syndrome is suspected, it is of critical importance to find the rudimentary male gonads (by means of MRI, pelvic echography, laparoscopy) and surgically remove them to prevent the onset of malignancies (<b>teratoblastoma,</b> gonadoblastoma). Once the considered disease has been identified, a continuous psychological help can be considered useful for the patient and the family...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionIndications {{and results}} of salvage surgery in mediastinal tumors are still unclear. This study {{analyzes}} a single-center experience to assess its mortality, morbidity, and long-term results. MethodsMediastinal salvage surgery (MSS) {{was defined as}} surgical resection of persistent or recurrent primary mediastinal tumors after previous local treatments with curative intent or exclusive chemotherapy in case of bulky tumors. Clinical data of patients undergoing MSS between 1998 and 2005 were analyzed. Overall and disease-specific long-term survival was calculated. ResultsTwenty-one patients (15 men and 6 women, mean age 41 years) underwent MSS. Eleven patients suffered from thymic tumors (eight thymomas, three thymic carcinoma) whereas 10 patients suffered from nonthymic tumors (one lung adenocarcinoma + thymoma, two mediastinal monophasic sinovial sarcoma, one mediastinal neuroendocrine tumor, one mediastinal <b>teratoblastoma,</b> one mediastinal disgerminoma, one Hodgkin's lymphoma, one mediastinal atypic carcinoid, two medullary thyroid carcinoma). MSS required extended vascular resection in 10 cases and cardiopulmonary bypass in one case. Median operation time was 215 minutes (range 140 – 720). One postoperative death and four major complications were recorded (overall mortality 4. 7 %, morbidity 19. 0 %). With a median follow-up of 30. 6 months, overall 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year Kaplan-Meier survival was 89. 7, 71. 2, and 56. 6 %, respectively. Thymic neoplasms had a better prognosis (1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year survival was 100, 87. 5, 87. 5 %, respectively) when compared with others (1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year survival was 77. 8, 53. 3, 26. 7 %, respectively—logrank p = 0. 0128). ConclusionsMSS can offer a chance of curative treatment in selected patients with an acceptable morbidity and mortality. Thymic tumors obtain the best results in term of long-term survival...|$|E
