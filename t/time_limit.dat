40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} changes {{brought about by the}} Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is the imposition of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> In this paper, we analyze a simple model in which a potential welfare recipient chooses how to allocate her time-limited endowment of benefits so as to maximize her expected lifetime utility. Not surprisingly, the model reveals that <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> provide an incentive for the consumer to conserve, or bank, her benefits. More interesting is the prediction that these incentives to conserve one's benefits vary inversely with the age of the youngest child in one's family. This implies that the reduction in welfare payments that results from PRWORA will fall disproportionately on families with young children. We estimate age group-specific effects of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> and test the prediction of the model using data from a welfare reform demonstration in Florida. Subject to some assumptions that are necessary to distinguish the effects of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> from the effects of other provisions of the demonstration, we find that <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> indeed reduce welfare use by the greatest amount among the families with the youngest children. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> have substantial effects on welfare utilization, reducing monthly utilization probabilities by 19 percent. <b>Time</b> <b>limits</b> lead families to exit the welfare rolls well before they exhaust their benefits, suggesting that welfare mothers are rational in the sense of being forward-looking. ...|$|R

40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{legislator}} {{has tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of late payment in commercial transactions by enacting the Financial Discipline Act. The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for commercial transactions between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for commercial transactions as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear. Has it been enacted to increase or to reduce the liquidity in the national economy?...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>limits</b> are {{a central}} {{component}} of recent welfare reforms and represent a substantial departure from previous policy.

In this paper I attempt to reconcile those findings with results from Grogger and Michalopoulos, who find <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> to have substantial effects that vary by the age of the youngest child in the family. Using data from the Current Population Survey, I obtain results similar to those of previous analysts when I estimate models that constrain the effects of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> to be independent of age. When I allow for age dependence and employ controls for time-varying state-level unobservables that may be correlated with the timing of welfare reform, however, I find that <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> have negative effects on welfare use and that those effects are stronger, the younger the youngest child in the family.
