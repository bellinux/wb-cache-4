5|$|Gemination {{occurs when}} a {{developing}} tooth incompletely splits into the formation of <b>two</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diastema is a {{condition}} {{in which there is a}} gap between <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E

5|$|P. l. sinhaleyus, {{known as}} the Sri Lanka lion, appears to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago. It is only known from <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> found in {{deposits}} at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Yunnan hare {{is smaller}} than the woolly hare; the supraorbitals are flat and small, and the toothrow and {{diastema}} (space between <b>two</b> <b>teeth)</b> are of different proportions. It also has a characteristic brighter pelage than the woolly hare, although, according to Gao Yaoting, the Yunnan hare's gray rump is also a characteristic of the woolly hare.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between <b>two</b> <b>teeth)</b> shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E

40|$|Fleece {{growth in}} Coopworth sheep {{is known to}} be {{influenced}} by season with maximum growth in late spring early summer. As replacement sheep are {{selected on the basis of}} hogget fleece weights which do not include the maximum wool growth period data were analysed to determine whether hogget fleece weights were correlated with adult fleece production. Three years fleece weight data from a small Coopworth stud flock was examined to determine the correlation between fleece production, over an 8 month period, from December to July, in ewe hoggets, compared with adult yearly fleece production in pregnant <b>two</b> <b>tooth</b> ewes. For one age group the <b>two</b> <b>tooth</b> and four tooth fleece performances were compared. Eight month fleece weights were not a good indicator of adult performance (t=O. 27) whereas <b>two</b> <b>tooth</b> fleece weight grown over a full year correlated significantly (r=O. 86) with four tooth fleeces grown over the same period. Ewe parity up to mid to late pregnancy did not influence the hogget or <b>two</b> <b>tooth</b> relationship. Implications for selection of replacements is discussed...|$|R

5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Charles Depéret {{described the}} first theropod remains from northwestern Madagascar in 1896. These included <b>two</b> <b>teeth,</b> a claw, and some vertebrae discovered along the Betsiboka River by a French army officer and {{deposited in the}} collection of what is now the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. Depéret referred these fossils to the genus Megalosaurus, which at the time was a wastebasket taxon containing any number of unrelated large theropods, as the new species M. crenatissimus. This name is derived from the Latin word crenatus ("notched") and the suffix -issimus ("most"), in reference to the numerous serrations on both front and rear edges of the teeth. Depéret later reassigned the species to the North American genus Dryptosaurus, another poorly known taxon.|$|E
5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named Lemur insignis and Lemur intermedius in 1895 {{on the basis of a}} few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur quickly followed. In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new genus and species, Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus Lemur (as Lemur jullyi), and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of Lemur insignis.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} wrote that these <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly {{second and third}} premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments for identifying Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich continues to identify them as Ferugliotherium {{on the basis of their}} size and provenance and other similarities between Ferugliotherium and multituberculates.|$|E

5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> is 11.2mm {{high and}} shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area {{that consists of}} dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E

5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have <b>two</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to the apex) and the other is subapical (below the apex tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; {{he also noted that}} subadults only possessed <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of the}} femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Józef {{received}} a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka.

There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: {{after one of the}} inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.|$|E

5|$|Legend {{goes that}} Tulsidas was born after {{staying in the}} womb for twelve months, he had all thirty <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were {{like that of a}} five-year-old boy, and he did not cry {{at the time of his}} birth but uttered Rama instead. He was {{therefore}} named Rambola (literally, he who uttered Rama), as Tulsidas himself states in Vinaya Patrika. As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi. In his works Kavitavali and Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas attests to his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the canine tooth. The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these <b>two</b> <b>teeth</b> are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose.

The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Sphecomyrma is an extinct genus of ants which {{existed in}} the Cretaceous {{approximately}} 79 to 92 million years ago. The first specimens were collected in 1966, found embedded in amber which had been exposed in the cliffs of Cliffwood, New Jersey, by Edmund Frey and his wife. In 1967, zoologists E. O. Wilson, Frank Carpenter and William L. Brown, Jr. published a paper describing and naming Sphecomyrma freyi. They described an ant with a mosaic of features, a mix of characteristics from modern ants and aculeate wasps. It possessed a metapleural gland, a feature unique to ants, it was wingless and possessed a petiole which was ant-like in form. The mandibles were short and wasp-like with only <b>two</b> <b>teeth,</b> the gaster constricted and the middle and hind legs had double tibial spurs. The antennae were, in form, midway between the wasps and ants, having a short first segment but a long flexible funiculus. Two additional species, S. canadensis and S. mesaki, were described in 1985 and 2005 respectively.|$|E
