5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of his professorial and garden duties, {{by the late}} 1870s <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.|$|E

5|$|After 13,000 {{years the}} Grand Galactics finally return to Earth and are astounded {{to see how}} fast the planet has developed.

5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in them.

Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of karma.|$|E
5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, {{the use of the}} drug {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of the}} world in that decade.

5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater.

5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution.

It proposed to place <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{operators}} and regulators face the enormous challenge to meet both {{the request for}} a high-performing grid {{as well as the}} public's concern about <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of electric power transmission. Although huge infrastructural projects for the development of interconnections are at several stages, <b>the</b> associated transmission <b>burdens</b> are not yet fully incorporated in the respective socioeconomic analysis. In this respect, the aim {{of this paper is to}} present a collective summary of electricity transmission burdens and their associated impacts. To increase coherence, <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> have been classified in the following categories: transmission losses; electromagnetic fields; infrastructure; visual intrusion; noise; interruption of supply; land use; ecosystems; and property values. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> relation with transmission technologies and associated impacts are illustrated in original overview tables. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E
