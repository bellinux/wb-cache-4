5|$|Juniper Networks {{introduced}} the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT). Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, {{as well as}} remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface {{for the development of}} third party tools for <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> was made available that September.|$|E

Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in <b>the</b> <b>appliance.</b> Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their families}} and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E

25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or fuse box. If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|E

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> to the socket. <b>The</b> <b>appliance</b> need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
25|$|This {{difference}} {{causes a}} current {{in the sense}} coil (6), which is {{picked up by the}} sense circuitry (7).

25|$|Ungrounded NEMA 1 plugs {{are still}} popularly used by {{manufacturers}} of small appliances and electronic devices {{because of the}} design's low cost and compact size, and they are upward compatible with modern grounded NEMA 5 receptacles. Standards permit ungrounded plugs where <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> does not require grounding due to low risk of leakage current, such as on double-insulated devices.|$|E

30|$|Generally speaking, <b>the</b> <b>appliances</b> in <b>the</b> ESHL can be {{classified}} into intelligent appliances and non-intelligent <b>appliances.</b> <b>The</b> intelligent <b>appliances,</b> which are mainly located {{in the kitchen of}} the ESHL, are from <b>the</b> German home <b>appliance</b> manufacturer, Miele.

As for <b>the</b> non-intelligent <b>appliances,</b> a so-called Wago box, a product from a German company named Wago, has been installed in the ESHL. The Wago box is able to, on the one hand, monitor the power consumption of every electrical consumer as well as each power socket in the ESHL and, on the other hand, control <b>the</b> state of <b>appliances</b> so as to realize home automation.|$|R

25|$|Orthodox {{and some}} Conservative {{authorities}} rule that turning electric devices {{on or off}} is prohibited as a melakhah; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may {{be considered as a}} type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11).

25|$|Plugs and sockets are {{designed}} as a system to meet standards for safety and reliability. Some types of socket may accept more than one type of plug; where this is an official, approved intention of the socket design, all the approved combinations will be tested to the applicable safety standards. Occasionally, plug and socket combinations may allow power to flow but may not meet product standards for mating force, earthing, current capacity, life expectancy, or safety. Improvised or user-modified connectors will not meet the product safety standards. Adaptors between different standards can overcome mechanical incompatibility. Physical compatibility does not ensure that <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> and socket match in frequency or voltage.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of <b>the</b> <b>appliance.</b>|$|E
