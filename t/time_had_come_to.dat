5|$|Macdonald {{was active}} in provincial Liberal Party {{organizational}} work during {{the latter part of}} the 1920s. In 1925, the party had suffered a crushing defeat after 43years in power. On election day, the Liberals were reduced to three seats in the Nova Scotia legislature. Many believed that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> return the party to its reformist roots. Macdonald worked with other reform-minded members to establish a network of younger Liberals intent on reviving their party.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> question whether or not private persons {{should be allowed to}} own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb {{would never}} escape the public {{identification}} {{of them with}} the case. In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President John F. Kennedy decided that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 Enrico Fermi Award. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was assassinated later that day. The award was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that <b>time,</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E

25|$|Writer Colin Brake {{suggested}} that 1989 {{was a year}} of big change for EastEnders, both behind the cameras {{and in front of}} them.

Producer Mike Gibbon was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the {{outbreak}} of the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Oz signed a statement supporting military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

He was quoted in the Italian paper Corriere della Sera as saying Hamas was responsible for the outbreak of violence, but the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> seek a cease-fire. Oz also said that if innocent citizens were indeed killed in Gaza, it should be treated as a war crime, although he doubted that bombing UN structures was intentional.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, John McDonagh, {{along with}} a newly formed fife study group, decided that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> make changes to the {{original}} 1960 ten-hole fife. A new manufacturer, Wilson Woods, with critical oversight from Roy Seaman once again, produced the new fife, designated the Regimental Model. Along with this new fife, a number of fingering changes were suggested {{to take full advantage}} of the improved design. For a number of years, both Larry Trout and Wilson Woods made McDonagh fifes jointly—Trout the fish-marked familiar McDonagh Model and Wilson the Regimental Model.Eventually, both men discontinued making fifes as of 2003.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period that {{advances}} {{were made in the}} development of buses that improved their reliability and introduced innovations such as the pneumatic tyre. The Board, which by this <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the realisation {{that it would not be}} able to afford to significantly extend the tramway network, purchased some additional buses to provide services in areas not served by the trams. These developments also led to the rise of the private bus operators, which were able to provide services in areas not covered by the Board, and later to directly challenge the Board itself. After introducing a number of measures to directly combat the private operators, legislative means were employed to deal with them.|$|E
25|$|The {{governing}} {{structure was}} changed by Augustus. In {{the course of}} his reconstitution of the urban administration he created new offices in connection with the public works, streets, and aqueducts of Rome. He found the quattuorviri and duoviri forming part of the body of magistrates known as vigintisexviri. These he reduced from 26 to 20 members (vigintiviri), but retained the quattuorviri among them. The latter were certainly still in existence under Hadrian (117-138). Augustus abolished the duoviri, no doubt because the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> deal comprehensively with the superintendence of the roads which connected Rome with Italy and the provinces. Dio Cassius relates that Augustus personally accepted the post of superintendent. In this capacity he represented the paramount authority which belonged originally to the censors. Moreover, he appointed men of praetorian rank to be road-makers, assigning to each of them two lictors. He also made the office of curator of each of the great public roads a perpetual magistracy, instead of a special and temporary commission, as had been the case hitherto.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Roger Revelle's {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an Institute of Science and Engineering adjacent to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography were spearheaded by his desire to immediately construct a science and library building on the present Revelle College site. When the university was eventually constructed, university librarian Melvin Voigt devised a plan to purchase books for the three new UC campuses: UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Irvine. The first Science and Engineering Library in Urey Hall satisfied the science-focused school's needs. However, as faculty recruits began to found social science and humanities departments, {{it became clear to}} Chancellor John Semple Galbraith that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> establish the campus's main library collections. One of the conditions of Galbraith's acceptance of the UCSD chancellorship had been that UCSD would house one of the three great libraries of the UC system. To accomplish this end, he formed a committee which commissioned architect William L. Pereira to prepare a master plan for the University Center and its focal point, the Central Library.|$|E
25|$|In an {{international}} press meeting, the Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang {{said that the}} formation crisis {{was an example of}} Belgium's failure to function as a state and that the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> declare Flemish independence. On September 1, the Flemish newspaper De Standaard devoted an issue {{to the question of whether}} a Flemish secession was realistic and viable. On September 2, during De Gordel, an annual Flemish cycling event in the periphery of Brussels with a strong political undertone, Eric Van Rompuy (member of the CD and the brother of explorateur Herman) and Bart De Wever (N-VA) emphasized that this should be the last De Gordel in which the problems surrounding the BHV were not solved. Flemish minister Geert Bourgeois (N-VA) also stated that the Flemish majority in the newly elected parliament should urgently solve the problem unilaterally - i.e. without the consent of the French speaking parties and thus without any offers. Other politicians, such as Flemish minister-president Kris Peeters (CD) and federal minister of Internal Affairs Patrick Dewael (Open VLD) participated in the event, but did not comment on BHV. Prominent absentees were Yves Leterme and Guy Verhofstadt.|$|E
25|$|Perpessicius' {{career was}} {{affected}} {{in various ways}} by Romania's communist regime. In 1948, he joined the editing staff of Viaţa Românească magazine, and, upon the proposal of Gala Galaction, was made a corresponding member of the newly reshaped Romanian Academy. In 1949, again on Galaction's proposal, he was considered for full membership the Academy (at {{the same time as}} Stancu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and poet Mihai Beniuc), serving as head of section at its Institute of Literary History and Folklore until 1954. Also in 1949, Perpessicius joined the communist-endorsed Writers' Union of Romania, created on the Writers' Society structure. A new volume of Eminescu's Opere (the first to feature previously unpublished works) and an edition of Însemnare a călătoriei mele ("Account of My Travel") by the early 19th century author Dinicu Golescu were both published in 1952. Perpessicius was also contributing prefaces to books published by Editura Cartea Rusă, a newly created institution which exclusively published works of Russian and Soviet literature. He received the State Prize for 1954, in recognition for his work in editing Eminescu, and, on June 21, 1955, received full Academy membership, with Camil Petrescu as rapporteur. At around the same time, Perpessicius focused some of his studies on the work of Lazăr Şăineanu, a linguist and folklorist whom specialized criticism of the <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> ignore.|$|E
