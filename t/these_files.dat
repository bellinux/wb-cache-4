5|$|Field {{released}} his debut album, Sub-Conscious, in 2006. It featured orchestral {{music from the}} Northwest Sinfonia. He created the album {{as a way to}} branch out from theatrical trailer composition into work as a solo artist. Field utilizes Logic Pro and MIDI for his musical composition; after this process he delivers <b>these</b> <b>files</b> along with an MP3 to the individual in charge of orchestration, who uses Finale software to convert this to musical notation. The album was made available on iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon.com, and for retail sale].|$|E
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on <b>these</b> <b>files</b> and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, {{are a source of}} information to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E

40|$|Some new schemes, {{possessing}} certain desirable properties, {{for organizing}} records with binary-valued attributes have been defined. It {{has been shown}} {{that it is possible to}} construct <b>these</b> <b>filing</b> schemes using finite geometires. The search time for a query involving any k attributes for <b>these</b> <b>filing</b> schemes based on finite geometries is very small in comparison wih existing filing schemes. Moreover, the search time does not depend on the number of records. The problem of updating is also quite simple...|$|R

25|$|A {{person who}} creates a design {{is known as}} an {{embroidery}} digitizer or puncher. A digitizer uses software to create an object-based embroidery design, which can be easily reshaped and edited. <b>These</b> <b>files</b> retain important information such as object outlines, thread colors, and original artwork used to punch the designs. When the file is converted to a stitch file, it loses much of this information, rendering editing difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|In November 2006, Chen {{purchased}} a pink PowerBook personal computer, {{a photograph of}} which he published on his blog. It {{may have come from}} eLite Multimedia, a computer shop in Hong Kong's Central district. According to the police, Edison Chen brought his computer to the shop for repairs in 2007. Employees who discovered over 1,300 intimate photographs of Chen and numerous female celebrities may have secretly copied <b>these</b> <b>files.</b> According to Chen, the image files were deleted before the computer was taken in for repairs.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} change from previous versions of IIS {{is that all}} web server configuration information is stored solely in XML configuration files, instead of in the metabase. The server has a global configuration file that provides defaults, and each virtual web's document root (and any subdirectory thereof) may contain a web.config containing settings that augment or override the defaults. Changes to <b>these</b> <b>files</b> take effect immediately. This marks {{a significant departure from}} previous versions whereby web interfaces, or machine administrator access, was required to change simple settings such as default document, active modules, and security/authentication.|$|E
25|$|After Net/1, BSD {{developer}} Keith Bostic {{proposed that}} more non-AT {{sections of the}} BSD system be released under the same license as Net/1. To this end, he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the AT code. Within eighteen months, all of the AT utilities had been replaced, and {{it was determined that}} only a few AT files remained in the kernel. <b>These</b> <b>files</b> were removed, and the result was the June 1991 release of Networking Release 2 (Net/2), a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as a Search Folder where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When <b>these</b> <b>files</b> are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|E

25|$|Between October 2005 and November 2006, an {{experienced}} hacker {{broke into a}} university database containing approximately 800,000 files of personal information. Names, Social Security Numbers, and basic contact information was contained in <b>these</b> <b>files,</b> but banking numbers were not. On November 21, 2006, the system administrators noticed unauthorized activity and blocked further access to the database. While it was not conclusive whether the hacker used these records to commit identity theft or fraud, {{it was determined that}} very few records were actually accessed and even fewer specifics were obtained.|$|E
25|$|Black Ops {{was first}} officially {{unveiled}} when the website {{for the game}} went live on April 30, 2010 prior {{to the release of}} its debut teaser trailer on GameTrailers TV Episode 310. In early April 2010, an unmarked envelope was sent to various gaming news publications as well as high-profile Call of Duty fans via mail. It contained a USB flash drive with sound and text files. <b>These</b> <b>files</b> were codes to be decrypted, only to find a mysterious teaser site for an unknown game. Other codes were updated periodically.|$|E
25|$|A {{built-in}} game recorder records battles {{for subsequent}} replay. <b>These</b> <b>files</b> {{can be downloaded}} from a server which supports BattleRecorder directly after their respective game. Recorded battle files are around 1 to 8 megabytes in size and are played within the Battlefield 2 engine. Camera angles can be changed (free roaming & selected player), {{as well as the}} speed, though there is no rewind capability. Files can be exported to AVI format. The Battlefield Recorder has facilitated the creation of various machinima. Usage of the PunkBuster service is mandatory for all official ranked Battlefield 2 servers, but optional for unranked servers.|$|E

25|$|On February 16, 2010, Braintree {{officials}} {{announced that the}} files previously declared missing had been located and turned over to Norfolk County prosecutors. Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating concluded, based upon <b>these</b> <b>files,</b> that probable cause existed in 1986 to arrest and charge Amy Bishop for crimes committed after she fled the house. She had taken the shotgun to a nearby auto dealership shop and brandished it at two employees {{in an attempt to}} get a car. She could have been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Eight file {{collections}} on UFO sightings, {{dating from}} 1978 to 1987, were first released on May 14, 2008, to The National Archives by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Although kept secret {{from the public}} for many years, most of the files have low levels of classification and none are classified Top Secret. 200 files are set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to the British government and officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher. The MoD released the files under the Freedom of Information Act due to requests from researchers. <b>These</b> <b>files</b> include, {{but are not limited}} to, UFOs over Liverpool and the Waterloo Bridge in London.|$|E
25|$|Although the UFO {{files were}} {{available}} to Defence personnel and Civilians Defence personnel for years, <b>these</b> <b>files</b> remained closed to outside researchers. In October 1979, extensively {{through the efforts of}} VUFORS researchers and Fl/Lt Brett Biddington (later Group Captain - RAAF), the RAAF invited Victorian researchers to visit the Intelligence Cell at RAAF Headquarters Support Command, Victoria Barracks, Victoria, to view the majority files collection and copy what they wished. This was a significant 'turn around' by the Defence Force, but it was the start of a period of remarkable co-operation between government departments and civilian groups. It was not until 1981 that another change in policy was instigated. A selection of general UFO files could be sent to Defence HQ, Russell Office, Canberra, when requested. The limited selection became open to other civilians for research after being vetted by a second controlling officer, but after their inspection they were returned to the Victorian collection.|$|E

25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice if there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, <b>these</b> <b>files</b> were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
500|$|An a-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} a listing of available forecast aid projections for a storm's history. The real-time guidance system uses {{a subset of the}} track and intensity information contained in <b>these</b> <b>files</b> to create the real-time guidance plots.
