5|$|Between World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the {{collapse}} of the Ottoman Empire, many historic European stud farms were lost; in Poland, the Antoniny and Slawuta Studs were wiped out except for five mares. Notable among the survivors was the Janów Podlaski Stud. The Russian Revolution, combined with the effects of World War I, destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia, but by 1921, the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program, the Tersk Stud, {{on the site of the}} former Stroganov estate, which included Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England. <b>The</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> survived the war re-established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert-bred Arabian horses from the Middle East. Not all European studs recovered. The Weil stud of Germany, founded by King Wilhelm I, went into considerable decline; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the Marbach State Stud in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained.|$|E

25|$|In late 1994, Microsoft {{was ready}} to release Windows 95, its next {{operating}} system. An {{important factor in the}} value consumers would place on it was <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees—Craig Eisler, Alex St. John, and Eric Engstrom—were concerned because programmers tended to see Microsoft's previous operating system, MS-DOS, as a better platform for game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the operating system would not be as much of a success. This was compounded by negative reception surrounding the Windows port of the video game The Lion King. The game used WinG, which crashed on Compaq Presarios that came shipped with it following a partnership between Compaq and Disney, as the Cirrus Logic display drivers used by the Presarios were not thoroughly tested with the API.|$|E

25|$|The Ingrim–Pabst–Pauley group {{attempted}} to sell KTVU to NBC in 1960, as the network sought {{to acquire a}} television station in the Bay Area to operate alongside KNBC radio (now KNBR). The sale was eventually cancelled in October 1961, due to pre-existing concerns over the sale cited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that were related to NBC's ownership of radio and television stations in Philadelphia. Eighteen months after the sale to NBC was aborted, in July 1963 channel 2 was sold to the Miami Valley Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, for $12.3 million; the sale was finalized in mid-October of that year. Over the station's history as an independent, KTVU's programming schedule consisted mainly of syndicated off-network series, movies, talk shows and religious programs, {{as well as a}} sizeable amount of locally produced news, sports, talk and public affairs programming. In 1960, after acquiring camera, projection and slide equipment to transmit programming available in the format, the station began broadcasting its programming in color; much of <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> it broadcast in color consisted of movies and certain series acquired from the syndication market that were produced in the format, as well as locally produced specials.|$|E
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee clashed {{again with}} the UFA's radical {{elements}} {{on the question of}} a provincial bank. The writings of C. H. Douglas advocating an economic system that he called social credit were attracting notice in Alberta, and his adherents included many UFA members. [...] Led by George Bevington, they sponsored a resolution at the UFA convention in January 1923 calling {{for the creation of a}} government-owned bank. [...] After Bevington's introduction, support for the resolution was running high; Brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that Alberta's debt load could not manage <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> Bevington proposed that a provincial bank should undertake. [...] Even so, the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial government to apply for a bank charter from the federal government, which was responsible for banking under the British North America Act, 1867. [...] At Brownlee's recommendation, the Greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of University of Alberta economist D. A. MacGibbon, which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial bank. [...] This mirrored Brownlee's own conclusion, reached after investigating state-run banks in New Zealand and New South Wales. [...] At the 1924 UFA convention, Bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands; Brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the MacGibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province. [...] In this he was supported by Henry Wise Wood, whom Bevington was challenging for the UFA presidency. [...] Brownlee proposed instead that the government's treasury branches should begin to accept deposits.|$|E
500|$|Vocational programs, {{known as}} Career and College Tech Prep classes, are {{available}} at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact, which includes the Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Stow-Munroe Falls, Tallmadge, and Woodridge school districts. [...] The compact, established in 1969, combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows students to participate in <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building. [...] There are 25 programs, six of which are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits. [...] The remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed to give students training and work experience. [...] College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include programs in athletic healthcare and fitness, manufacturing and engineering, landscape horticulture, and teaching. [...] Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business-related programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, construction and remodeling, cosmetology, electronics, health technology, marketing, and out-of-school internships. [...] Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation, culinary arts, theater arts, automotive repair and technology, banking and finance, and early childhood educational aide training. [...] Each program also has co-curricular component, meaning they have both in-class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student's overall grade. [...] One example is the Roosevelt chapter of DECA, {{which is part of the}} marketing education program. [...] In 2016, DECA members representing Roosevelt advanced to the international competition for the 30th consecutive year.|$|E
