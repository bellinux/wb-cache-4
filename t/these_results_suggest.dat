5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

25|$|Mrc1/Claspin {{proteins}} couple leading-strand synthesis {{with the}} CMG complex helicase activity. Mrc1 interacts with polymerase ε {{as well as}} Mcm proteins. The importance of this direct link between the helicase and the leading-strand polymerase is underscored by results in cultured human cells, where Mrc1/Claspin is required for efficient replication fork progression. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that efficient DNA replication also requires the coupling of helicases and leading-strand synthesis...|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} that hydrogen-rich water (HRW) {{treatment}} could alleviate the toxicities of CdCl 2, NaCl and H 2 O 2, leading to improved mycelial growth and biomass. The HRW treatment decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS and significantly increased the activities of antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GR). <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggested</b> that HRW treatment might enhance the antioxidant abilities to induce the mycelial growth in H. marmoreus. Besides, pyruvate kinase was activated by HRW treatment, suggesting that HRW treatment also activated the glucose metabolism. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggested</b> that the usage of HRW could be an effective approach for contaminant detoxification in H. marmoreus.|$|R

25|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{progesterone}} on nicotine addiction, participants in one study were either treated orally with a progesterone treatment, or treated with a placebo. When treated with progesterone, participants exhibited enhanced suppression of smoking urges, reported higher ratings of “bad effects” from IV nicotine, and reported lower ratings of “drug liking”. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that progesterone not only alters the subjective effects of nicotine, but reduces the urge to smoke cigarettes.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{the most}} common form of dementia, have been studied {{extensively}} as far as priming goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show decreased priming effects on word-stem completion and free association tasks, while retaining normal performance on lexical decision tasks. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that AD patients are impaired in any sort of priming task that requires semantic processing of the stimuli, while priming tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 U.S. study {{based on}} 2006 data {{estimated}} {{the prevalence of}} ASD in 8-year-old children to be 9.0 per 1,000 (approximate range 8.6–9.3). A 2009 report based on the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey by the National Health Service determined that the prevalence of ASD in adults was approximately 1% of the population, with a higher prevalence in males and no significant variation between age groups; <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that prevalence of ASD among adults {{is similar to that}} in children and rates of autism are not increasing.|$|E

25|$|<b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that the}} four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Prior stress {{exposure}} heightens fear learning during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Stress-related {{increases in}} ghrelin circulation {{were shown to}} be necessary and sufficient for stress to increase fear learning. Ghrelin {{was found to be}} upregulated by stress {{even in the absence of}} adrenal hormones. Blocking the ghrelin receptor during stress abolished stress-related enhancement of fear memory without blunting other markers of stress. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that ghrelin is a novel branch of the stress response. Human studies are needed to translate the use of anti-ghrelin treatments to prevent stress-induced psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|The RBE of {{different}} types of heavy particles on CNS function and cognitive/behavioral performance was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the thresholds for the HZE particle-induced disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning is shown in figure 6-4; and for the disruption of operant responding is shown in figure 6-5. These figures show a similar pattern of responsiveness to the disruptive effects of exposure to either 56Fe or 28Si particles on both CTA learning and operant responding. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the RBE {{of different}} particles for neurobehavioral dysfunction cannot be predicted {{solely on the basis of}} the LET of the specific particle.|$|E

25|$|The TSP, in {{particular}} the Euclidean variant of the problem, has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce good quality solutions quickly. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for these problems, and have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first issue of the Journal of Problem Solving was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males {{were randomly assigned}} to females to create half-sib families to determine the heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers found that there was additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E
25|$|MMP-3 {{also does}} {{damage to the}} blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), the {{functional}} equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, after spinal cord injury (SCI). In a similar study conducted using MMP-3 WT and KO mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BSCB permeability, with the WT mice showing greater BSCB permeability than the KO mice after spinal cord injury. The same study also found decreased BSCB permeability when spinal cord tissues were treated with a MMP-3 inhibitor. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that the presence of}} MMP-3 serves to increase BSCB permeability after SCI. The study showed that MMP-3 accomplishes this damage by degrading claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 (another tight junction protein), similar to how MMP-3 damages the BBB.|$|E
