5|$|While {{considering}} {{the character of}} Chang, absent since The Blue Lotus, Hergé <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom {{he had not seen}} since the days of their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé learned much about Chinese culture for his work on The Blue Lotus. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

25|$|Without {{calling into}} {{question}} {{the value of the}} preceding analyses, the third interpretation, which comes from an Assumptionist systematic theologian, Fr. George Tavard (19222007), a Frenchman living in the United States, places the emphasis on the deeply Trinitarian inspiration of d’Alzon’s writings, articulated around themes and actions which champion the rights of God. This undeniable aspect does not appear to us to invalidate the others because, on the one hand, d’Alzon was influenced by the Christocentric <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> day and because, on the other hand, Fr. Tavard speaks more on or about Fr. d’Alzon than from Fr. d’Alzon himself.|$|E
25|$|While {{researching the}} First Folios in the Folger Library, Robert Evans came across an epitaph for Shakespeare that was {{previously}} unrecorded. The epitaph appears in verse, {{similar to that}} of the sonnets, and shows just how highly Shakespeare's contemporaries <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. The lines of the epitaph themselves echo lines from sonnet 55, which bring into thought the ideas of that particular sonnet itself. Through the verses of the sonnet, the young man becomes immortal. Through the verses of the epitaph, as well as the larger context of praise for the dead poet, Shakespeare himself becomes immortal, echoing and reinforcing his very argument in sonnet 55.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. He looks to Vagrant Story as a title that demands to be in English and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an English-speaking audience. He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a British accent to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E

25|$|Brownlow's 1980 {{reconstruction}} was re-edited {{and released}} in the United States by American Zoetrope (through Universal Pictures) with a score by Carmine Coppola performed live at the screenings. The restoration premiered in the United States at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 23–25 January 1981; each performance showed to a standing room only house. Gance could not attend because of poor health. At {{the end of the}} 24 January screening, a telephone was brought onstage and the audience was told that Gance was listening on the other end and wished to know what they had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> film. The audience erupted in an ovation of applause and cheers that lasted several minutes. The acclaim surrounding the film's revival brought Gance much-belated recognition as a master director before his death only 11 months later, in November 1981.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Heydrich {{had five}} children. His oldest, Peter Thomas Heydrich (1931–2000), was a {{well-known}} German cabaret singer, {{and wrote a}} book about his childhood, father, and uncle. In the book, Peter Heydrich describes how, as a youth, he enjoyed the fame of being a “crown prince,” the nephew of Reinhard Heydrich. During boyhood, he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uncle as a successful sportsman and a sensitive musician. In Prague, Peter observed that his uncle had become a “high animal.” Peter derived many privileges from being Reinhard Heydrich’s nephew. Even after the war, Peter still felt some pride in the familial relationship, if not so openly. But finally, Peter Heydrich had to admit that Reinhard Heydrich was a protean schemer, who planned and executed the Holocaust and other crimes. Peter died on 22 November 2000, after a long illness.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} after {{entering}} the Columbia River and trading with the natives, ship and crew sailed to China {{to sell the}} pelts before returning to Boston in July 1793. Gray's entering of the Columbia was later used, during the Oregon boundary dispute, to support the American claim to the Oregon Country, against the claim of Britain. The American and British diplomats raised many points in addition to Gray's voyage to support their cases. Neither side could agree that the other had established a clear and exclusive right of sovereignty. The British raised several points questioning whether Gray's voyage up the Columbia River had any value in establishing sovereignty. The Americans raised counter-points. No agreement was reached on this and many other points about the right to the Oregon Country. In the end the dispute was resolved by compromise in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. Upon Gray’s return, though, little was <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> discovery. He did not publish it, and the long-term consequences to which it contributed were unforeseen.|$|E
