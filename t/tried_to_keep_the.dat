5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found it extremely peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's way of dealing with the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one of the camps that held INA prisoners, he was moved by the conditions in which they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed out that these prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{assimilate}} the Jews into Russia’s economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782.

Although Michael <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> blinding of John a secret, the news eventually leaked out and Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos excommunicated Michael VIII.

Thereafter, Sanjna tried her best to keep her eyes open, however she flickered them angering Surya again who proclaimed that her daughter would be Yamuna.

25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the house}} was part of one of the main {{commercial}} centers of the city.

The family <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> upper part of the house for itself, but economic realities eventually forced them out of the house altogether to rent it entirely as tenements.|$|E
25|$|The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{tried to}} settle this issue in 1956 by declaring Colymbus a {{suppressed}} name unfit for further use and establishing Gavia, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons. However, the situation was not completely resolved even then, and the following year the ICZN had to act again to prevent Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot's 1818 almost-forgotten family name Urinatoridae from overruling the much younger Gaviidae.

25|$|Ballard and {{the younger}} Smythe were accused in 1969 of {{stealing}} money from the corporation and avoiding income taxes by having Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. pay for many of their personal expenses. The controversy created a rift between the two and Bassett, which led to Smythe and Ballard being fired from their management positions in 1969, only to win back control the following year. In September 1971, Bassett sold his shares to Stafford Smythe and Ballard. Just six weeks later, Smythe died. His brother and son <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> shares within the Smythe family, but in February 1972 all of Smythe's shares were purchased by Ballard, leaving him with majority ownership {{of the building and}} the Leafs.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} events in 1971 made Ballard the primary owner of the Maple Leafs. After a series of {{disputes}} between Bassett, Ballard and Stafford Smythe, Bassett sold his {{stake in the company}} to them. Shortly afterwards, Smythe died in October 1971. Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an executor, each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death. Stafford's brother and son <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> shares in the family, but in February 1972 Ballard bought all of Stafford's shares for $7.5 million, valuing the company at $22 million. Six months later, Ballard was convicted of charges including fraud, and theft of money and goods, and spent a year at Milhaven Penitentiary.|$|E
25|$|Charles XII of Sweden succeeded Charles XI of Sweden in 1697, aged 14. From his predecessor, he {{took over}} the Swedish Empire as an {{absolute}} monarch. Charles XI had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> empire out of wars, and concentrated on inner reforms such as reduction and allotment, which had strengthened the monarch's status and the empire's military abilities. Charles XII refrained from all kinds of luxury and alcohol and usage of the French language, since he considered these things decadent and superfluous. He preferred the life of an ordinary soldier on horseback, not that of contemporary baroque courts. He determinedly pursued his goal of dethroning his adversaries, whom he considered unworthy of their thrones due to broken promises, thereby refusing to take several chances to make peace. During the war, the most important Swedish commanders besides Charles XII were his close friend Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld, also Magnus Stenbock and Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt.|$|E
