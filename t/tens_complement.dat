40|$|The innate {{immune system}} of fish is the primary defense against acute diseases. The marine medaka Oryzias melastigma {{has been shown to}} be a {{potential}} marine fish model for ecotoxicology, but little is known about the {{innate immune system}} of this small fish. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify differentially expressed immune genes in the liver of O. melastigma infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Among the 396 genes identified, based on NCBI BLAST search of the 1279 sequenced clones in the SSH libraries, 38 (9. 6 %) were involved in the immune process. Besides, genes involved in biological regulations (5. 6 %); cellular metabolism (24. 7 %); general response to stimuli (4. 8 %); cellular component organization (2. 3 %); signal transduction (2. 5 %) and transport process (2. 8 %) were also obtained. <b>Ten</b> <b>complement</b> component genes involved in four activation pathways were quantified (using q-PCR) and exhibited different patterns of transcription between the control and challenged individuals. The results reported upon here support the feasibility of developing O. melastigma as a marine model fish to understand the basic biological processes related to immune function and for immunotoxicological research. Findings of this study established a genetic platform for studying immune function using O. melastigma. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{study of}} the venous {{channels}} in the cavernous sinus in 48 sphenoid bones was performed. Thirty-eight bones were electrolyticly decalcified, subsequently embedded in gelatin, and cut in 1 mm thick slices. Microdissection of the other <b>ten</b> specimens <b>complemented</b> the analysis. Every specimen had the venous structure arranged as a plexus, however, although the channels were variable in number, form, and diameter, the two sides were quite symmetrical. Channels of smaller diameter predominated anteriorly. There was no demonstrable muscular layer in these vessels; the endothelial lining was easily visualized. Fatty tissue separated the venous channels {{from each other and}} from arteries and nerves. The distance from the carotid artery and the lateral wall increased anteriorly, but there were significant veins between these two structures in only 35 % of the cases. In about one third of specimens the oculomotor nerve was placed over the carotid artery. The abducens nerve was found to be intimately related to the lateral wall without any venous channels between them in 92 % of the specimens...|$|R
50|$|ACS is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} instrument that became the primary imaging instrument aboard HST. It offered several important advantages over other HST instruments: three independent, high-resolution channels covering the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regions of the spectrum, a large detector area and quantum efficiency, resulting {{in an increase in}} HST's discovery efficiency by a factor of <b>ten,</b> a rich <b>complement</b> of filters, and coronagraphic, polarimetric, and grism capabilities. The observations undertaken with ACS provided astronomers {{with a view of the}} Universe with uniquely high sensitivity, as exemplified by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and encompass a wide range of astronomical phenomena, from comets and planets in the Solar System to the most distant quasars known.|$|R
30|$|The {{summer school}} was {{followed}} by several specialized training courses including a course on advanced LC-MS and multivariate statistics at the UFZ, Leipzig, Germany, a course on in vitro and in vivo assays of endocrine disrupting chemicals using fish models at INERIS, Verneuil-en-Halatte, France, and a course focusing on chemical screening, prioritization of environmental pollutants and data storage in European databases in the Jasna Valley, Slovakia. In total, <b>ten</b> specialized courses <b>complemented</b> by local scientific and soft skill training courses provide a comprehensive supplement to the scientific work in a traditional PhD thesis. An additional component of the training program involves 1 - to 3 -month secondments (at least one secondment per fellow) hosted by EDA-EMERGE partner institutes to work on aspects of the PhD research where the host institute possesses specialized expertise in analytical techniques or data analysis not typically associated with the home institute. The advantages of the secondment initiative is that, {{in addition to the}} specialized skills and expert training acquired, the fellows also broaden their professional network and obtain a different research or working perspective.|$|R
40|$|The {{blood of}} twelve {{patients}} with parasitologically proved visceral leishmaniasis was examined {{for the presence}} of antibodies against blood cells. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) was positive in <b>ten.</b> IgG and <b>complement</b> were found on the red cells (alone or combined), but no IgA or IgM. In the serum of two, warm antibodies were found in the bromelin test. Pseudo-agglutination was detected in 8. Investigations for white cell antibodies included the lymphocytotoxicity test (positive in 10), the leuco-agglutination test (positive in 1) and the indirect immunofluorescence test on lymphocytes (none positive) and granulocytes (2 positive). Platelet autoantibodies were demonstrated in the direct (10 positive) and indirect (7 positive) platelet suspension immunofluorescence test. How important these various antibodies are in influencing the lifespan and functions of the respective cells and thus in the pathogenesis of the pancytopenia of kala-azar, can not be concluded from this work but the absence of a direct correlation between haematological values and presence or absence of antibodies and/or their titres argues against a primary role of these antibodie...|$|R
40|$|Linked Data has {{established}} {{itself as an}} emerging standard for the publication of structured data over the Web, enjoying amazing growth {{in terms of the}} number of organizations committing to use its best practices and technologies for ex- posing and interlinking data sets for seamless exchange, integration, and reuse. More and more ICT ventures offer innovative data management services on top of Linked (Open) Data, creating a demand for data practitioners with a back- ground in semantic technologies. Ensuring the availability of such expertise will prove crucial if European businesses are to reap the full benefits of the advanced data management technology, and the know-how accumulated over the past years by researchers, technology enthusiasts and early adopters in various European countries. EUCLID had a major contribution to this goal by providing a com- prehensive educational curriculum, supported by multi-modal training materials and state-of-the-art eLearning distribution channels, tailored to the real needs of data practitioners. Building upon experience reports from over twenty Linked Data projects with over forty companies and public offices in more than <b>ten</b> countries, <b>complemented</b> by feedback from hundreds of training events, and an in-depth analysis of the community discourse through mailing lists, discussion forums, Twitter, and the blogosphere, the curriculum focuses on techniques and software to integrate, query, and visualize Linked Data, as core areas in which practitioners state to require most assistance. It is realized as a combination of multi-modal learning resources, including an iBook published on iTunes U, and evaluated through webinars, f 2 f training, and continuous community feedback. By providing these key knowledge-transfer components, EUCLID will not only promote the industrial uptake of Linked Data best practices and technologies, but, most importantly, will contribute to their further development and consol- idation, and support the sustainability of the community, all essential aspects given the rapid pace at which the field has recently advanced. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{role of the}} {{teichoic acid}} polymers found in Gram-positive bacterial cell walls is not known. Studies of Bacillus subtilis hybrid strains implicate a defined chromosomal region, which includes the tag- 1 locus, as necessary for teichoic acid biosynthesis. A set of ten mutants carrying lesions in this region was identified from among forty-four temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants generated by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis and bacteriophage 029 selection. This protocol gave a population enriched for ts, versus auxotrophic, mutants. For each of the ten mutants, the frequency of genetic reconstruction, or correction, of the ts phenotype indicated that {{it was due to}} change(s) in a single gene. Results of two-factor transformation crosses sorted the mutants into three complementation groups; all <b>ten</b> could <b>complement</b> tag- 1. Mutants in two complementation groups were transformed to ts⁺ with cloned rodC DNA. The map order of the newly isolated ts markers was determined from the results of two factor crosses. Orientation with respect to the hisA marker was inferred from transduction experiments. The newly isolated strains were shown to be conditional rod⁻ mutants. Growth at 48 °C resulted in reduced growth rates and spherically shaped cells. Additional phenotypes seen for some mutants, namely 029 phage resistance and ts spore outgrowth, appeared closely associated with the ts rod⁻ mutation. Wall phosphate content for two of the mutants, following growth at 48 °C, was found to be reduced in comparison to the wild-type control. Taken together these results lend support to the argument that the tag- 1 region of the chromosome, which most likely directs teichoic acid biosynthesis, is important for establishment and maintenance of the normal bacillary morphology seen for B. subtilis. The importance of other gene products to the organization of newly synthesized wall was examined using B. subtilis macrofibers. Left- and right-handed macrofibers were converted to spheroplasts and the multi-celled structures regenerated under the two sets of conditions conducive for production of the original, and inverse hand. The helix hands observed for the regenerated structures always corresponded to those expected {{on the basis of the}} parental genotype...|$|R
40|$|Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 This {{study used}} a mixed methods {{approach}} {{to investigate the}} intimate world of men’s sexual problems in Portugal, and particularly erectile dysfunction, focusing on the interplay between individual, societal and relational factors. First, a community-based survey was designed, with 323 primary health care users, to investigate how sociocultural factors influence experiences and representations of sexual problems. Second, a qualitative study, involving in-depth interviews with a subsample of <b>ten</b> heterosexual men, <b>complemented</b> by five heterosexual women’s narratives, concerning men’s sexual problems, was carried out to {{understand the meaning of}} sexual problems from a lay perspective. Statistical analysis of quantitative data was carried out through logistic regressions to evaluate the sociodemographic predictors of lay representations of sexual problems. Qualitative data were analyzed using an empirically grounded typology. The role of individuals in the construction of sexual dysfunctions, particularly erectile dysfunction, was explored using sexual script theory. Key findings revealed the impact of sexual problems on daily life. Gender analysis results contributed to the understanding of how men and women challenge the definition of sexual problems as normal changes versus dysfunctional changes. Specific patterns of change in sexual experiences and sexual problems were identified in the Portuguese gendered society, which can possibly be applied to other nations and cultures...|$|R
