50|$|Efforts {{to apply}} Christian {{teaching}} {{to the resolution}} of social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19th century.

Thus, evangelical converts were leading figures {{in a variety of}} 19th century reform movements.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a novel anti-malware system called SplitScreen. SplitScreen performs an additional screening step prior to the signature matching phase found in existing approaches. The screening step filters out most non-infected files (90 %) and also identifies malware signatures that are not of interest (99 %). The screening step significantly improves end-to-end performance because safe files are quickly identified and are not processed further, and malware files can subsequently be scanned using only the signatures that are necessary. Our approach naturally leads to a network-based anti-malware solution in which clients only receive signatures <b>they</b> <b>needed,</b> <b>not</b> every malware signature ever created as with current approaches.

25|$|In geometry, a Steiner {{chain is}} a set of n circles, all of which are tangent to two given {{non-intersecting}} circles (blue and red in Figure 1), where n is finite and each circle in the chain is tangent to the previous and next circles in the chain. In the usual closed Steiner chains, the first and last (nth) circles are also tangent to each other; by contrast, in open Steiner chains, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> be. The given circles α and β do not intersect, but otherwise are unconstrained; the smaller circle may lie completely inside or outside of the larger circle. In these cases, the centers of Steiner-chain circles lie on an ellipse or a hyperbola, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirements}} for becoming a Grandmaster are somewhat complex.

In addition, at least two favorable results (called norms) from a total of at least 27 games in tournaments involving {{at least three other}} Grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's, are usually required before FIDE will confer the title on a player. There are other milestones a player can achieve to get the title, such as winning the Women's World Championship, the World Junior Championship, or the World Senior Championship.

In the end, after possessing the same number of points as Saudi Arabia, North Korea qualified through goal difference.

25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the short end of the hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must be done on the ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> be shot.|$|E

25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous.

The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E

25|$|Kennel clubs {{provide the}} {{recognition}} of distinct dog breeds, {{but there are many}} independent clubs with differing, and sometime inconsistent standards and <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> apply scientific standards. Four varieties of the Belgian Shepherd Dog are recognised as four distinct breeds by the New Zealand Kennel Club. Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the feist is a hunting dog raised in the Southern United States for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other dog types and breeds. However, the United Kennel Club recognizes one breed of feist, the Treeing Feist, while the American Kennel Club does not recognize any feist breed.|$|E
