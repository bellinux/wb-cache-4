This report {{presents the results of}} an analytical study of the system dynamics and performance of a split torque gearbox that uses a balance beam mechanism for load sharing. The Lagrange method was applied to develop a system of equations of motion. The mathematical model includes time-varying gear mesh stiffness, friction, and manufacturing errors. Cornell's method for calculating the stiffness of spur gear teeth was extended and applied to helical gears. The phenomenon of sidebands spaced at shaft frequencies about gear mesh fundamental frequencies was simulated by modeling <b>total</b> <b>composite</b> gear <b>errors</b> as sinusoid functions. Although the gearbox has symmetric geometry, the loads and motions of the two power paths differ. Friction must be considered to properly evaluate the balance beam mechanism. For the design studied, the balance beam is not an effective device for load sharing unless the coefficient of friction is less than 0. 003. The complete system stiffness as represented by the stiffness matrix used in this analysis must be considered to precisely determine the optimal tooth indexing position...|$|R

Methods: A cross-sectional study of consecutive glaucoma patients was designed. We assessed the patients&# 39; quality of life through the Brazilian 25 -question version of the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire, comprising 12 subscales (general health, general vision, ocular pain, near vision, distance vision, social function, mental health, role limitations, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision) and a <b>total</b> <b>composite</b> score. Clinical features, including current medical treatment, were obtained from each patient&# 39;s medical record. Three groups of patients were identified according to the prostaglandin in use: bimatoprost, latanoprost, or travoprost. The main outcome measures were: mean score in each subscale and mean <b>total</b> <b>composite</b> score. Results: The mean <b>total</b> <b>composite</b> score for the whole group was 70. 60.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{construct}} a robust nonparametric estimator for the production fron- tier. The main tool is a concept of robust regression boundary defined as a special probability- weighted moment (PWM). We first study this problem under a regression model with one-sided errors where the regression function defines the achievable maximum output, for a given level of inputs-usage, and the regression error defines the inefficiency term. Then we consider a stochastic frontier model where the regression errors are assumed to be composite. It is more realistic to assume that the actually observed outputs are contaminated by a stochastic noise. The additive regression errors in the frontier model are then composed from this noise term and the one-sided inefficiency term. In contrast to the one-sided error model, where the direct use of empirical PWMs is fruitful, the <b>composite</b> <b>error</b> problem requires a substantial different treatment based on deconvolution techniques. To ensure the identifiability of the model we can only assume an independent Gaussian noise. In doing so, the estimation of the robust PWM frontiers, including the true regression boundary, necessitates the computation of a survival function estimator from an ill-posed equation. A Tikhonov regularized solution is constructed and nonparametric frontier estimation is performed. We unravel the asymptotic behavior of the resulting frontier estimators in both one-sided and <b>composite</b> <b>error</b> models. The procedure is very easy and fast to implement. Practical guidelines to effect the necessary computations are described via a simulated example.
