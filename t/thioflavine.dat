Detection of protein aggregates is needed in the process of protein characterization and during optimization of pharmaceutical formulations. This paper describes a technique, which consists of analysing protein aggregates by fluorescence microscopy after staining with the hydrophobic probe Nile Red. Dilution, filtration or other modifications of the sample are not needed. Assessment of aggregation was possible in highly concentrated protein samples (193 mg/ml). Fluorescence microscopy observations allowed the detection and characterization of protein aggregates not easily detected by spectroscopic techniques. Nile Red was shown to be very sensitive for the detection and analysis of immunoglobulin aggregates. Nile Red, Congo red and <b>Thioflavine</b> T stainings were compared. Nile Red and <b>Thioflavine</b> T fluorescence were colocalized. The diameter of immunoglobulin aggregates was determined, and the number of aggregates was correlated with 90 degrees light scattering measurements.

Aggregation of recombinant full-length murine PrP in the presence of 100 mm NaCl allowed us to isolate three different types of oligomers by size-exclusion chromatography. In contrast to PrP monomers and fibrils, these oligomers activate the classical complement pathway, the smallest species containing 8 – 15 PrP protomers being the most efficient. We used <b>Thioflavine</b> T fluorescence to monitor PrP aggregation and showed that, when added to the reaction, C 1 q has a cooperative effect on PrP aggregation and leads to the formation of C 1 q-PrP complexes.

In this study, the biophysical properties and fibrillation kinetics of α-synuclein in the presence of rotenone were investigated and, more specifically, the effects of rotenone on the early-stage misfolded forms of α-synuclein were considered. The <b>thioflavine</b> T (ThT) fluorescence assay studies provide evidence that early-phase misfolded α-synuclein forms are affected by rotenone and that the fibrillation process is accelerated.

This fibrillar material possesses extensive β-sheet structure as revealed by far-UV CD and IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the fibrils exhibit Congo red birefringence, increased fluorescence with <b>thioflavine</b> T and cause a red-shift of the Congo red absorption spectrum. All of these characteristics are typical of amyloid fibrils. The results indicate that formation of amyloid occurs when the native fold of a protein is destabilized under conditions in which noncovalent interactions, and in particular hydrogen bonding, within the polypeptide chain remain favorable.

For α-chymotrypsinogen A, the scaling behavior is combined with the kinetics of aggregation to deduce separate values for the characteristic timescales for nucleation (τn) and growth (τg), as well as the stoichiometry of the nucleus (x). The analysis illustrates a general procedure to noninvasively and quantitatively determine τn, τg, and x for soluble (chain polymer) aggregates, as well as the relationship between τn/τg and aggregate Mw...|$|E
40|$|The paired helical {{filaments}} (PHFs) of Alzheimer's disease were purified by {{a strategy}} {{in which the}} neurons and amyloid plaque cores of protein (APCP) were initially isolated. This was achieved by several steps of isocratic sucrose centrifugations of increasing molarity and a discontinuous isotonic Percoll density gradient. After collagenase elimination of contaminating blood vessels, lysis of neurons was produced by SDS treatment. The released PHF cytoskeletons were separated from contaminating APCP and lipofuscin by sucrose density gradient. A final step consisted in the chemical purification of highly enriched PHFs and APCP components via a formic acid to guanidine hydrochloride transition. PHFs and APCPs were fractionated by size exclusion HPLC and further characterized and quantitated by automatic amino acid analysis. We also present some of the morphological and immunochemical characteristics of PHF polypeptides and APCP. Our studies indicate that apart from differences in localization and morphology, PHF and APCP significantly differ in (a) chemical structure (peptide and amino acid composition); (b) epitope specificity (antiubiquitin, antitau, antineurofilament); (c) physicochemical properties (structural conformation in guanidine hydrochloride); and (d) <b>thioflavine</b> T fluorescence emission. These parameters strongly suggest important differences in the composition and, probably, in the etiopathology of PHF and APCP of Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|The liposoluble {{insecticide}} rotenone {{is commonly}} used as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor to replicate Parkinson's disease (PD) pathological features. However, there was no assessment of the spatial learning and memory abilities in chronic rotenone-induced PD models. In the present study, by rotarod test and <b>Thioflavine</b> T staining, we first noted the impairment of motor coordination in rotenone-treated group for 3 months, as well as alpha-synuclein inclusions in the nigral dopaminergic neurons in C 57 BL/ 6 mice with intragastrical delivery of rotenone (5 mg/Kg) for 3 months rather than 1 month. We then evaluated spatial learning and memory abilities by Morris water maze task in this model. The results showed escape latency reduced in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 3 months, indicating an improvement of learning ability. However, it was delayed slightly but not significantly in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 1 month. Similarly, we demonstrated that spatial memory ability was enhanced in 3 -month-treatment group, but impaired in 1 -month-treatment group. There were no proliferating cell nuclear antigen and doublecortin positive cells in the hippocampus by double immunofluorescent staining, indicating the absence of hippocampal neurogenesis in rotenone-intoxicated mice. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory abilities are disturbed in chronic rotenone-intoxicated PD model...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{play key}} roles in gene {{expression}} regulation in both healthy and disease brains. To better understand those roles, {{it is necessary}} to characterize the miRNAs that are expressed in particular cell types under a range of conditions. In situ hybridization (ISH) can demonstrate cell- and lamina-specific patterns of miRNA expression that would be lost in tissue level expression profiling. In the present study, ISH was performed with special focus on the human entorhinal cortex (EC) and transentorhinal cortex (TEC). The TEC is the area of the cerebral cortex that first develops neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the reason for TEC’s special vulnerability to AD-type pathology is unknown. MiRNA ISH was performed on three human brains with well-characterized clinical and pathological parameters. Locked nucleic acid ISH probes were used referent to miR- 107, miR- 124, miR- 125 b, and miR- 320. In order to correlate the ISH data with AD pathology, the ISH staining was compared with near-adjacent slides processed using <b>Thioflavine</b> stains. Not all neurons or cortical lamina stain with equal intensity for individual miRNAs. As with other areas of brain, the TEC and EC have characteristic miRNA expression patterns. MiRNA ISH is among the first methods to show special staining characteristics of cells and laminae of the human TEC...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate cDNAs {{encoding}} proteins that specifically interact with the 42 -aa β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a major constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer’s disease. The carboxy terminus of α 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 M), a proteinase inhibitor released in response to inflammatory stimuli, {{was identified as a}} strong and specific interactor of Aβ, utilizing this system. Direct evidence for this interaction was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation of α 2 M with Aβ from the yeast cell, and by formation of SDS-resistant Aβ complexes in polyacrylamide gels by using synthetic Aβ and purified α 2 M. The association of Aβ with α 2 M and various purified amyloid binding proteins was assessed by employing a method measuring protein–protein interactions in liquid phase. The dissociation constant by this technique for the α 2 M–Aβ association using labeled purified proteins was measured (Kd = 350 nM). Electron microscopy showed that a 1 : 8 ratio of α 2 M to Aβ prevented fibril formation in solution; the same ratio to Aβ of another acute phase protein, α 1 -antichymotrypsin, was not active in preventing fibril formation in vitro. These results were corroborated by data obtained from an in vitro aggregation assay employing <b>Thioflavine</b> T. The interaction of α 2 M with Aβ suggests new pathway(s) for the clearance of the soluble amyloid peptide...|$|E
