5|$|In sum number place (Samunampure), {{the regions}} are of {{irregular}} shape and various sizes. The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The clues are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The {{minimum number of}} clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site replaces sums with relations: the clues are symbols =, < and > showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not known whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> possible.|$|E

5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
