40|$|There is a {{need for}} low-cost, high-accuracy {{measurement}} of water content in various materials. This study assesses the performance of a new microwave swept frequency domain instrument (SFI) that has promise to provide a low-cost, high-accuracy alternative to the traditional and more expensive time domain reflectometry (TDR). The technique obtains permittivity measurements of soils in the frequency domain utilizing a through transmission configuration, <b>transmissometry,</b> which provides a frequency domain <b>transmissometry</b> measurement (FDT). The measurement is comparable to time domain <b>transmissometry</b> (TDT) with the added advantage of also being able to separately quantify the real and imaginary portions of the complex permittivity so that the measured bulk permittivity is more accurate that the measurement TDR provides where the apparent permittivity is impacted by the signal loss, which can be significant in heavier soils. The experimental SFI was compared with a high-end 12 GHz TDR/TDT system across a range of soils at varying soil water contents and densities. As propagation delay is the fundamental measurement of interest to the well-established TDR or TDT technique; the first set of tests utilized precision propagation delay lines to test the accuracy of the SFI instrument’s ability to resolve propagation delays across the expected range of delays that a soil probe would present when subjected to the expected range of soil types and soil moisture typical to an agronomic cropping system. The results of the precision-delay line testing suggests the instrument is capable of predicting propagation delays with a RMSE of +/− 105 ps across the range of delays ranging from 0 to 12, 000 ps with a coefficient of determination of r 2 = 0. 998. The second phase of tests noted the rich history of TDR for prediction of soil moisture and leveraged this history by utilizing TDT measured with a high-end Hewlett Packard TDR/TDT instrument to directly benchmark the SFI instrument over a range of soil types, at varying levels of moisture. This testing protocol was developed to provide the best possible comparison between SFI to TDT than would otherwise be possible by using soil moisture as the bench mark, due to variations in soil density between soil water content levels which are known to impact the calibration between TDR’s estimate of soil water content from the measured propagation delay which is converted to an apparent permittivity measurement. This experimental decision, to compare propagation delay of TDT to FDT, effectively removes the errors due to variations in packing density from the evaluation and provides a direct comparison between the SFI instrument and the time domain technique of TDT. The tests utilized three soils (a sand, an Acuff loam and an Olton clay-loam) that were packed to varying bulk densities and prepared to provide a range of water contents and electrical conductivities by which to compare the performance of the SFI technology to TDT measurements of propagation delay. For each sample tested, the SFI instrument and the TDT both performed the measurements on the exact same probe, thereby both instruments were measuring the exact same soil/soil-probe response to ensure the most accurate means to compare the SFI instrument to a high-end TDT instrument. Test results provided an estimated instrumental accuracy for the SFI of +/− 0. 98 % of full scale, RMSE basis, for the precision delay lines and +/− 1. 32 % when the SFI was evaluated on loam and clay loam soils, in comparison to TDT as the bench-mark. Results from both experiments provide evidence that the low-cost SFI approach is a viable alternative to conventional TDR/TDT for high accuracy applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Off-site {{transfer}} of nutrient-rich burnt soil {{has implications for}} downstream water quality. Coarsening of effective particle size (EPS) distributions in burnt material via aggregation of fines into composite particles modifies post-fire sediment and nutrient transport dynamics. Experiments were undertaken to establish temperature controls on wildfire-enhanced soil aggregation. Burnt and unburnt soil from a temperate eucalypt forest were analysed for EPS and settling velocity using a LISST-ST (Laser In Situ Scatter and <b>Transmissometry</b> with Settling Tube) particle size analyser. Next, samples were burnt (250 – 550 ◦C) before further analysis with the LISST-ST. Settling velocities of naturally burnt soil aggregates were greater than unburnt aggregates of the same EPS. Experimental burning indicated that dense water-stable aggregates form at relatively low temperatures (250 ◦C) probably due to distillation and carbonisation, through pyrolysis, of organic volatiles in surface litter. Under these conditions, the EPS distribution of burnt surface soil coarsens with up to 50 % of the < 63 -µm fraction becoming aggregated. A positive relationship between ‘plant-available’phosphorus and burn temperature was observed. Given that {{a large proportion of}} soil particulate phosphorus is associated with the < 63 -µm fraction, fire-related aggregation processes have potentially important implications for post-fire fine sediment and nutrient transport and storage dynamics...|$|E

Vertical REE profiles in three water columns showed horizontal variation of REE concentrations within 1000 – 1200 m. Hydrothermal plumes were discovered by anomalous values of methane, manganese and <b>transmissometry</b> at that site. Europium anomalies in the North Pacific deep water (NPDW) (Nozaki et al., 1999) normal-ized pattern decreased with distance from the hydrothermal vent site, indicating that the dilution of hydrothermal fluid in the plume can be traced using REE. The horizontal variation of negative Ce-anomalies represents the continuous scaveng-ing of REE by suspended matter in the plume. In addition, we measured nine hydrothermal fluid samples. The REE geochemistry of hydrothermal vent systems had been investigated intensively at sediment-starved mid-oceanic ridges, but few studies had examined sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems {{like those of the}} Okinawa Trough. The chondrite-nor-malized REE patterns of the fluids collected at Yonaguni Knoll IV show typical lighter rare earth elements (LREE) and Eu enrichment similar to at the Mid-ocean Ridge sites.

Furthermore, particles are separated into four classes according to their size, and the intermittent properties of these classes are considered. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used, associated with arbitrary-order Hilbert spectral analysis (AHSA), in order to retrieve scaling multifractal moment functions, for scales from 10 s to 8 min. The intermittent properties of two other indicators of particle concentration are also considered in the same range of scales: the total volume concentration C vol-total and the particulate beam attenuation coefficient c p (670).

Sensors were chosen so that they could be remotely connected through cabling over more than 100 m, guaranteeing adequate accuracy and high reliability over time. To take into account the heterogeneity of plant cover, the site was divided into six irrigation macro-sectors managed separately by the automated system. These macro-sectors were selected by classifying the area on the basis of water requirements, cover type and evapotranspiration demand. The software allowed different irrigation criteria to be defined, considering the values supplied by the moisture sensors singly or on average.

Additional calibration during the wet period significantly improved CRNP correlations over traditional one-time calibration taken under drier conditions. Soil moisture is a key variable in most environmental processes, and the cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) fills a niche for intermediate-scale soil moisture measurements. In this study, the CRNP estimated soil moisture was compared with a soil moisture measurement network including 108 time domain <b>transmissometry</b> (TDT) probes. We also used a Hydrus- 1 D numerical model of measured soil moisture at targeted locations by inversely fitting soil hydraulic parameters used to simulate soil moisture in the near surface (0. 03 and 0. 05 m) during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012. Both simulated and TDT-measured soil moisture were used in constructing the depth-weighted mean areal soil moisture for comparison with the CRNP estimates. The results showed that near-surface soil moisture estimated by the numerical simulation improved {{the correlation between the}} sensor network and the CRNP estimation, especially during rainfall events. The CRNP estimates of soil moisture exhibited a dry bias under relatively wet conditions {{at the beginning of the}} snow-free period because of the almost binary spatial distribution of soil moisture. Using a combination of soil moisture measurements and near-surface simulations, the CRNP output was recalibrated to capture the wetter conditions, resulting in a RMSE (0. 011 m 3 /m 3) of less than half the original calibration RMSE (0. 025 m 3 /m 3). The calibration was validated using CRNP data from the 2013 growing season against independent soil moisture values. ...|$|E
40|$|Scattering by {{atmospheric}} aerosols {{is one of}} {{the environmental}} parameters determining the range performance of optical and infrared sensors. Extinction of the target contrast along the path due to scattering is difficult to estimate in real operational conditions due to uncertainties in the size distribution of the particles, their constitution and concentration along the path. Knowledge on their behaviour allows calculation of the atmospheric transmission by means of standard scattering formulae. In-situ measurement of the characteristics of the particles by means of counters provides data of limited value due to the possible impact of the direct environment. The data may also be not representative for the particles at other locations along the path. Similarly the measurement of the particle characteristics by means of LIDAR provide an asymmetric view, while the backscatter by the particles is difficult to translate into extinction coefficients in forward direction. Multi-band <b>transmissometry</b> along the path of interest provides however direct information on the real atmospheric propagation characteristics. Furthermore the multi-band data allow the validation of the aerosol model, to be used in transmission models such as MODTRAN. The VAMPIRA trials, organised in March/April 2004 by Germany in the Baltic Sea near Eckernförde, provided an opportunity to test the usefulness of a 7 -channel optical/IR transmissometer, developed at TNO-FEL. In this paper the set-up of the system is described and samples of data are presented.

40|$|Water {{content is}} an {{important}} parameter of soil impacting the physical, chemical and biological properties and processes within. Presently, most of the soil water content sensors on the market are based on electromagnetic (EM) field and dielectric permittivity theory. Water content is essentially determined by soil dielectric properties yielding accurate determinations in most cases {{because of the high}} permittivity of water (80) relative to other soil constituents. When it comes to soil texture, many EM sensors show good performance in 2 ̆ 7 non-relaxing 2 ̆ 7 sand, but not so satisfying in 2 ̆ 7 relaxing 2 ̆ 7 clay nor in high electrical conductivity (EC) conditions. The objectives of this study were to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating EM sensors under difficult soil conditions associated with relaxation and electrical conductivity. Considering the advantages of liquid dielectrics, which are homogeneous and stable, easy to acquire, standardized and repeatable, we employed glycerol, water, silica flour and potassium chloride mixtures to simulate high clay content soil with varied electrical conductivity. One of the goals in this case was to create dielectric properties similar to clay soils in the frequency domain. Eleven different water content sensors were tested, including time domain reflectometry (TOR), time domain <b>transmissometry</b> (TOT), capacitance-based, impedance-based and fixed frequency sensors. The results reveal that the response of sensors operating at low frequency (less than 100 MHz) were more dramatically altered by increasing electrical conductivity than sensors operating at relatively high frequencies (i. e., TOR and TOT), which showed greater tolerance for variation in electrical conductivity..

The multi-disciplinary research approach involves two major activities: 1) continuous, shipboard, assessments of carbon system properties and air-sea fluxes of CO 2 and relationships to other variables in the river margin shelf ecosystem of the Mississippi River, and 2) targeted process measurements that examine relationships of air-sea carbon flux to net community metabolism, and phytoplankton community composition in different regions of the river-ocean mixing gradient. Process measurements were conducted in at distinct regions along the river-ocean mixing gradient, thereby addressing key natural variability and uncertainties in ocean margin carbon flux.

40|$|A laser in situ {{scattering}} and <b>transmissometry</b> (Lisst- 100) probe {{has been}} used for estimating the particle-size distribution of phytopankton, purple photosynthetic sulphur bacteria (Chromatiaceae), and suspended inorganic sediments in different lakes. Results from Lisst- 100 have been compared to laboratory measurements, such as those obtained by using a Galai laser size analyzer (GL), an optical microscope (OM), and a flow cytometer (FC). Although all of these instruments were shown to provide reliable values of the particle number concentration for the given populations, the Lisst- 100 was the fastest and most reliable instrument because it did not require manipulation of the samples—which is not the case of GL, OM and FC instruments—and avoided the tedious procedure of microscopic counts. The total particle volume concentration results obtained with Lisst- 100 differed from those obtained with GL for populations with large and porous aggregates, such as phytoplankton cells. The difference was attributed to the breakage of fragile algal aggregates resulting from the measuring procedure used by GL. Although for suspended sediment particles both instruments gave the same results for the total particle volume concentration, the particle-size distribution obtained with GL was found always shifted to smaller diameters than with Lisst- 100, probably because inorganic sediment particles present compact aggregates. When these aggregates break, they split into a high number of small particles that contribute the same to the total volume concentration as the previous aggregates. Finally, results of the total particle volume concentration with Lisst- 100 were in accordance with those obtained with GL for the Chromatiaceae population, because cells remained in a dispersed phase. A good correlation was found between the total particle volume concentration of Chromatiaceae measured with Lisst- 100 and the concentration of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a), which is the parameter habitually used to estimate the concentration of Chromatiaceae. Therefore, Lisst- 100 was found to be a reliable instrument to estimate the Chromatiaceae concentration in aquatic ecosystems.

An original field strategy based on Lagrangian monitoring, using the back-scattered signal of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), Laser In Situ Scattering and <b>Transmissometry</b> (LISST) measurements, water samples, and aerial photographs, has shown good results in describing suspended sediment concentration (SSC) dynamics from a turbid plume. The behaviour of suspended sediment has been studied, for the first time, to our knowledge, from their release at the dredger overflow to their deposition on the seabed. A fluid mixture, overflowed from the TSHD, with a mean concentration of 6 g L 1 of mineral and organic silty sands, induces the formation of a turbid plume {{at the rear of the}} TSHD, with an immediate dilution effect about 10 - 100 on SSC. Then, the SSC decreases through the process of lateral dispersion and sedimentation until the plume disappear in 2 hours. Evolution of the plume characteristics (SSC, particle size and nature, geometry) makes it possible to quantify the processes involved: dilution, advection, dispersion, and settling. The passive and dynamic behaviours of the plume are analysed. Extensions of deposits are calculated for spring tide conditions: 800 m for sand and 6. 5 km for silt. This study has been conducted in macrotidal and specific dredging conditions (orientation of the dredging tracks against currents, dredger speed, loading capacity, overflow type), whose effects on plume dispersion have been quantified.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve risk {{characterization}} and remediation measures for soil and groundwater contamination, {{there is a need}} to improve in situ vadose zone characterization. However, most available technologies have been developed in the context of agricultural soils. Such méthodologies are not applicable at industrial sites, where soils and contamination differ in origin and composition. In addition, most technologies are applicable only in the first meters of soils, leaving deeper vadose zones with lack of information, in particular on field scale heterogeneity. In order to overcome such difficulties, a vadose zone experiment has been setup at a former industrial site in Belgium. Industrial activities carried out on site left a legacy of soil and groundwater contamination in BTEX, PAH, cyanide and heavy metals. The experiment comprises the combination of two techniques: the Vadose Zone Monitoring System (VMS) and cross-hole geophysics. The VMS allows continuous measurements of water content and temperature at different depths of the vadose zone. In addition, it provides the possibility of pore water sampling at different depths. The system is formed by a flexible sleeve containing monitoring units along its depth which is installed in a slanted borehole. The flexible sleeve contains three types of monitoring units in the vadose zone: Time Domain <b>Transmissometry</b> (TDT), which allows water content measurements; Vadose Sampling Ports (VSP), used for collecting water samples coming from the matrix; the Fracture Samplers (FS), which are used for retrieving water samples from the fractures. Cross-hole geophysics techniques consist in the injection of an electrical current using electrodes installed in vertical boreholes. From measured potential differences, detailed spatial patterns about electrical properties of the subsurface can be inferred. Such spatial patterns are related with subsurface heterogeneities, water content and solute concentrations. Two VMS were installed in two slanted boreholes on site, together with four vertical boreholes containing electrodes for geophysical measurements.

The objective of this research was to test the LISST?s ability in detecting monospecific blooms in-situ and the ability to detect aggregation after diatoms were subjected to different temperatures and bacteria concentrations. The PSDs of ten harmful algal bloom (HAB) species were measured with the LISST characterizing the peak location, peak height, peak width, and peak range resulting in a scattering signature for each species. Each species had specific characteristics that would allow for their detection with the LISST, though microscope observations would be needed for complete accuracy. The LISST was able to detect HABs placed in natural seawater collected off the Texas coast. Blooms of four HAB species before they reached full? bloom concentrations were detected making the LISST a possible low cost, effective tool in the early detection and monitoring of HABs. The diatom, Odontella aurita, was used to test how well the LISST could monitor aggregation, an important process in the termination of many phytoplankton blooms. Increasing temperature causes an increase in transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) production in diatoms, which is a critical sticky particle that increases the probability of aggregation. An increase in temperature can also cause an increase in bacteria concentration that can positively effect TEP production and thus aggregation. O. aurita was grown at 20 ?C and 28 ?C and showed a significant increase in TEP abundance with temperature (p = 0. 002), though no relationship between TEP production and bacteria concentration existed. Coomassie stained particles (CSP) are proteinaceous gel-like particles, which are currently understudied.

The role of carbon-rich transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) in aggregate formation as ocean temperature increases has yet to investigated in continuous cultures. I hypothesize that temperature increase can influence the production of TEP, a fraction of total suspended exopolymers. To test the hypothesis, a laser in situ scattering and <b>transmissometry</b> instrument (LISST- 100 X, Sequoia Instruments) successfully counted and sized six individual diatom species in batch culture: Chaetoceros muelleri, Coscinodiscus wailesii, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Skeletonema costatum, and Skeletonema marinoi and successfully demonstrated its efficacy in detecting diatom aggregates using S. costatum. Four replicate continuous cultures were sampled for particle size distribution (PSD), nutrients, chlorophyll a, total carbohydrates, prokaryote concentration, and TEP at temperatures of 22. 5, 27 and then 20 degrees C. While TEP particles were scarce, acid polysaccharide (APS) -coated C. muelleri cells were observed, forming dense webs on the filters. Both carbohydrate per cell and APS area per cell were found to significantly correlate with temperature (p< 0. 05) while significant difference between APS concentration at each temperature was only found between 27 and 22. 5 or 20 degrees C (p< 0. 05). Net changes in PSDs with increasing temperature showed that distributions of relative volume concentration decreased in the smallest size bins and increased in the largest size bins. Our results show that increasing the temperatures of nitrogen-limited C. muelleri cultures did not cause increased TEP formation but instead resulted in increased cell-surface coating. Increasing concentration of cell coatings and TEP particles will cause diatoms to aggregate more readily, enhancing their sinking rate away from the ocean surface. Increased ocean temperature has great implications for diatom blooms and other microorganisms, causing greater export of carbon out of the surface waters and potentially altering the microbial loop...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{effects and}} mechanistic efficiency of chemical oil spill countermeasures must be evaluated {{prior to their}} ethical application during real spill response scenarios. Equally important {{is the ability to}} monitor the effectiveness of any spill response in real time, permitting informed response management. In-situ sensors are key components of such event based monitoring and continuous monitoring programs. This project investigates crude oil toxicity as a particulate suspension, suitability of in-situ instrumentation to measure crude oil suspensions, and the applicability of using acoustic backscatter to measure suspended solids and sub-surface oil droplet suspension concentrations. The ecological effects to inter- and sub-tidal sediment dwelling organisms exposed to crude oil, both treated with a chemical dispersant and un-treated, was evaluated. Elevated toxicity, expressed as percent mortality and reduced luminescence, and oil concentrations were observed in inter-tidal sediments receiving oil only treatments compared to oil-plus-dispersant treatments. Sub-tidal sediments showed heterogeneous distribution of crude oil with elevated amphipod mortality compared to no oil controls suggesting an oil-sediment aggregation mechanism. A separate laboratory scale study found that the soluble crude oil fractions were responsible for the observed mortality in pelagic species while the more dominant oil droplet fractions were relatively non-toxic. Subsequent studies focused on the in-situ detection of crude oil and particle suspensions in aqueous environments. The first showed that both in-situ fluorescence spectroscopy and Laser In-Situ Scattering <b>Transmissometry</b> (LISST) can effectively measure crude oil concentrations in aqueous environments. The applicability of the LISST implies that crude oil in an aqueous medium can be measured as a particle suspension. Acoustic backscatter (ABS) was investigated for its applicability as a surrogate measurement technology for aqueous particle suspensions. This study showed a log linear correlation between ABS and volume concentration (VC) over a variable particle size distribution. This correlation is due to the dependency of both ABS and VC to the particle size distribution. Log-linear ABS responses to oil-droplet suspension volume concentrations were also demonstrated. However, the inability to reproduce response factors suggests that more work is required to produce viable calibrations that may be used for sub-surface oil plume detection...|$|E
40|$|Pyrophaeophorbide-a, a {{degradation}} product of chlorophyll-a, is predominantly formed by grazing processes in sediments {{as well as}} in the water column. Water column profiles of pyrophaeophorbide-a/suspended particulate organic carbon (SPOC) concentrations, at an abyssal site in the northeast (NE) Pacific (Sta M, 34 ° 50 ′N, 123 ° 00 ′W; 4100  m water depth), show low concentrations (0. 01 – 0. 1  ng/μg SPOC) at surface and mesopelagic depths, and increasing concentrations with closer proximity to the sea floor (0. 05 – 0. 6  ng/μg SPOC). However, in June 1992, the deep maximum of pyrophaeophorbide-a/SPOC in the water column of Sta M extended higher into the water column, as much as 1600  m above the bottom (mab) (2500  m water depth); in other seasons they only extended up to 650  mab (3450  m water depth). Previous studies have demonstrated lateral transport of particulate matter from the continental shelf to the deep ocean off the coast of northern California. Recent work suggests that the benthic boundary layer (BBL) extends to 50 mab, based on sediment trap and <b>transmissometry</b> measurements (Smith, K. L., Kaukmann, R. S., Baldwin, R. J., 1994. Coupling of near-bottom pelagic and benthic processes at abyssal depths. Limnology and Oceanography 39, 1101 – 1118.), and that lateral transport is significant only during summer, which is consistent with our observations. A partial vertical profile of pyrophaeophorbide-a/SPOC from the north central (NC) Pacific provides some evidence that the deep maximum may be absent due to the distance of this site from the continental margin. Thus, the observed deep maximum of pyrophaeophorbide-a/SPOC at Sta M is likely due mainly to lateral transport from the continental slope rather than to local vertical resuspension in the BBL exclusively. Pyrophaeophorbide-a concentrations in SPOC at Sta M were negatively correlated with Δ 14 C values of SPOC (SPOC samples from Druffel, E. R. M., Bauer, J. E., Williams, P. M., Griffin, S. A. and Wolgast, D., 1996, Seasonal variability of particulate organic radiocarbon in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Journal of Geophysical Research 101, 20543 – 20552), further supporting our contention that pyrophaeophorbide-apeaks in the deep water column are derived from “older” resuspended sediments that were laterally transported from continental margin sediments. Our molecular biomarker (pyrophaeophorbide-a) data are reflective of a specific fraction of SPOC that likely remains in the water column for long periods of time or is derived from resuspended sediments...|$|E
40|$|In situ vadose zone {{characterization}} {{is essential}} to improve risk characterization and remediation measures for soil and groundwater contamination. However, most available technologies have been developed {{in the context of}} agricultural soils. Most of these methodologies are not applicable at industrial sites, where soils and contamination differ in origin and composition. In addition, they are applicable only in the first meters of soils, leaving deeper vadose zones with lack of information, in particular on field scale heterogeneity. To overcome such difficulties, a vadose zone experiment has been setup at a former industrial site in Belgium. Industrial activities carried out on site left a legacy of soil and groundwater contamination in BTEX, PAH, cyanide and heavy metals. The experiment involves the combination of two techniques: the Vadose Zone Monitoring System (VMS) and cross-hole geophysics. The VMS allows continuous measurements of water content at different depths of the vadose zone (Dahan et al., 2009). In addition, it provides the possibility of pore water sampling at different depths. The system is formed by a flexible sleeve installed in a slanted borehole (Fig. 1) and containing monitoring units along its depth (Fig. 2). The flexible sleeve contains three types of monitoring units in the vadose zone: Time Domain <b>Transmissometry</b> (TDT), which allows water content measurements; Vadose Sampling Ports (VSP), used for collecting water samples coming from the matrix; and the Fracture Samplers (FS), which are used for retrieving water samples from the fractures. Cross-hole electrical tomography measurements are carried providing detailed spatial patterns about electrical properties of the subsurface. Such properties are related with subsurface heterogeneities, water content and solute concentrations. Two VMS were installed on site, together with four vertical boreholes containing electrodes for geophysical measurements. The site has been monitored under natural recharge conditions during the summer, autumn and winter. Results show reactions in the soil at depths up to 6 m as a consequence of rainfall infiltration and groundwater level fluctuations. In addition, the chemistry of the soil water changes with depth and water infiltration. Background images obtained from geophysical measurements show a highly conductive subsurface due to the lithologies and the high mineralization of the water in the vadose zone. The combination of cross-hole geophysics with the VMS has provided an effective tool for characterizing the chemistry and the structure of the vadose zone. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{monitoring}} and modelling {{of the marine}} environment is of importance to both {{the general public and}} the scientific community, but relies on the ability to obtain accurate measurements of suspended particle characteristics. Many instruments for measuring particles rely on optical and acoustic scattering from the particles and use this information to infer a particle size and concentration. However, assumptions such as spherical particles of a known composition are widely used, both in measurement technology and in numerical modelling. Various imaging techniques have shown great variability in the shape, size and composition of marine particles when measured within their natural environment. Subsequently, there is substantial uncertainty in the response of light scattering instruments to this diverse range of particles. In this study, a holographic camera was modified to simultaneously record in-focus images of marine particles with their forward angle scattering characteristics. This was achieved by combining both laser scattering and <b>transmissometry</b> with digital holography. The results from this system were compared with theoretical models of scattering from spherical particles within the intended size range of both instruments (15 - 500 microns), with particle size information from both techniques agreeing well during these idealised conditions. The combined holographic and light scattering system was then used to investigate the response of the LISST- 100 (Sequoia Scientific Inc.) to spherical particles with diameters extending beyond that intended by the instrument 250 microns for type-B and 500 microns for type-C derivatives), but that have been observed in-situ with imaging methods. This revealed an aliasing of single large particles into multiple smaller particles during the inversion of LISST- 100 scattering into a particle size distribution. For spheres greater than the type-C instrument range, the inversion of scattering produces particle volume distributions that peak at varying sizes between 250 - 400 microns. This key finding highlights the need for care to be taken when interpreting particle size distributions from the LISST- 100 when there is potential for particles outside of its range limit. Natural particles, extracted from coastal waters, were then recorded by the combined laboratory system. These complex particles produced highly variable scattering properties which were contaminated by asymmetrical features within the azimuthal plane. This observation of strong azimuthal asymmetry is of concern for both measurements and models of optical properties that assume a symmetrical scattering function for natural particle populations. The azimuthal asymmetry in scattering contributed to additional variability in the response of the instrument in comparison to the holographic camera, which was also subjected to apparent particle break-up via segmentation during image processing. A discussion of holographic imaging and laser diffraction for characterising particles in-situ forms the final part of this thesis, which utilises data from a magnified holographic system that covers the same size range of the LISST- 100. This final analysis demonstrated the need for future technology to accurately measure size distributions over a much larger range of sizes than is currently possible (e. g. < 2 microns to 1000 microns). In summary, three key factors were identified to cause an increase in the apparent number of small particles reported by the LISST- 100 : 1) contamination from scattering of particles larger than the intended size range of the instrument; 2) a decrease in refractive index (particle composition); 3) additional scattering from small sub-components of particle geometry. The standard holographic camera systems are capable of accurately obtaining particle size and concentration measurements that are comparable to other techniques such as the LISST- 100. However, in situations where background illumination is poor, errors in the image processing routines can cause an apparent particle break-up due to incorrect binarisation. Despite this, the holographic method provides a unique and powerful mechanism that enables images of particles to be analysed within the context of their in-situ environment. NER...|$|E
