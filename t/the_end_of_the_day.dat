5|$|And, at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts {{will tell you that}} the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there are plenty of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E

5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and that in {{four and a half years}} spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details.
