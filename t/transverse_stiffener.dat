40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{resistance}} of plated girders composed of compact flanges and slender webs, which are usualy stiffened with longitudinal and transversal stiffeners {{in order to increase}} their capacity. Thin plated girders do not loose capacity due to the local buckling, as it happens in the case of column buckling, but they develop significant post-critical resistance after the elastic critical stress has been exceeded. A large parametric study was conduced in order to explain the effects of the <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> stiffness on the behaviour of plated girders. The <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> has to provide a rigid support to the plate, which assures the development of full post-critical shear resistance. The pourpose of numerical simulations in Abaqus was to find the second moment of inertia, providing a sufficent stiffness of the stiffener and to find out how various geometrical parameters affect the behaviour of the stiffener and resistance of the panel. Results of numerical simulations were compared with the requirements from standards SIST EN 1993 - 1 - 5 and AASHTO. The {{studies have shown that the}} SIST EN 1993 - 1 - 5 design rule based on the axial force turns out to be conservative. Based on numerical results a new design rule for intermediate transverse stiffeners is proposed. The new rule provides a necessary second moment of inertia of the stiffener which fulfills the stress and strain requirements for rigid transverse stiffeners...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} wooden bridges in the United States. Their decks are often built of timber beams nailed {{together}} {{and covered with}} asphalt. The asphalt plays a mechanical role, and it provides environmental protection for the wood deck. The asphalt layer deteriorates and requires replacement. That leads to a faster deterioration of the deck, increased maintenance, and shorter bridge life. The flexibility of the deck is a probable cause of the fast deterioration of the asphalt. Low temperatures lead to deformations of the deck and may lead to cracks, which are propagated by mechanical and environmental effects. This project investigates stiffening the bridge deck by connecting a beam perpendicularly to the deck planks with metal bolts to reduce deformations of the deck. The additional beam is called a <b>Transverse</b> <b>Stiffener</b> Beam (or TSB). It can be incorporated {{as a part of}} new bridges or be attached to existing bridges. The investigations show the TSB significantly reduces deformations of the deck in most cases. The study indicates the positive effects of the TSB's should be expected in other applications. The magnitude of the effects can be analyzed with the computer program developed during this project. An investigation of the use of <b>Transverse</b> <b>Stiffener</b> Beams (TSB) for use on new and existing wooden bridges to reduce deformations of bridge decks, thus prolonging the life of asphalt bridge coverings, was undertaken. Positive effects of TSBs should be expected in other applications and can be analyzed with a computer program developed by this project. Local Road Research Boar...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} studies {{have confirmed that}} curved I-girders are capable of developing substantial shear postbuckling resistance due to tension field action and have demonstrated that the AASHTO LRFD equations for the tension field resistance in straight I-girders may be applied to curved I-girders within specific limits. However, the corresponding demands on intermediate <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in curved I-girders are still largely unknown. Furthermore, a number of prior {{research studies}} have demonstrated that <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in straight I-girders are loaded predominantly by bending induced by their restraint of web lateral deflections at the shear strength limit state, not by in-plane tension field forces. This is at odds with present Specification approaches for the design of <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> which are based on (1) providing sufficient stiffener bending rigidity only to develop the shear buckling strength of the web and (2) providing sufficient stiffener area to resist the in-plane tension field forces. In this research, the behavior of one- and two-sided intermediate <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in straight and horizontally curved steel I-girders is investigated by refined full nonlinear finite element analysis.

40|$|A {{total of}} 10 {{full-scale}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the strength and behaviour of reinforced coped steel I-beams. The test parameters included the length of longitudinal <b>stiffeners,</b> length of <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> combined longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> double <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> cope depth and cope length. For the coped beam specimens without stiffeners, local web buckling failure occurred in the cope. For the specimens with longitudinal stiffeners only, the general failure mode was flexural yielding of the full beam section {{at the location of}} maximum bending moment followed by web crippling {{at the end of the}} cope between the longitudinal stiffeners and the top flange of the full beam section. In contrast, the general failure mode for the specimens with combined longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> consisted of flexural yielding of the full beam section at the location of maximum bending moment followed by flange local buckling near the loading position. The test results show that the reinforcements were able to increase the capacity of the coped beam specimens significantly and the results also illustrate that in addition to cope depth, cope length also affects the behaviour and strength of the reinforced coped beam specimens. Based on the limited test data, a modification to the current reinforcement details for coped beams was proposed. The proposed reinforcement details accounted for the effects of various cope details. To increase the range of applicability of the proposed reinforcement details, a numerical study is currently underway to consider a wider range of cope details.

40|$|Summary. This {{report is}} an {{extension}} of previous theoretical investigations of the elastic buckling in shear of flat plates reinforced by <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The plates are treated as infinitely long and simply-supported along the long sides. Stiffeners are spaced at regular intervals, dividing the plate into a nuraber of panels of uniform size. The effect of bending and torsional stiffnesses of the sLiffeners upon the buckling shear stress is calculated for the complete range of stiffnesses, for panels with ratios of width to stiffener spacing of 1, 2 and 5. The results are presented in tabular and graphical forms. 1. I~¢troduction. [...] Accurate knowledge of the buckling shear stresses of flat plates is necessary for the design of web beams and of panels in fuselage skins and wing surfaces. In this report buckling stresses are obtained for infinitely-long flat plates, simply-supported along the edges and reinforced by equally spaced <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> that have both bending and torsional stiffness. But these buckling stresses can be used with little error in calculating the buckling shear stress of finite sheet-stringer combinations if the buclding pattern is repeated several times along the length. Buckling shear stresses of infinitely-long plates with <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> were calculated by Schmieden 1, SeydeP and Wang a for plates with weak stiffeners, and by Budiansky, Conner an...|$|R

40|$|Existing design {{methods for}} web {{stiffeners}} differ widely in concept {{and in the}} stiffener size which results. An investigation has been conducted to provide a rational, usable and validated design method for transverse stiffeners. The proposed design method takes account of the axial compression in stiffeners caused by tension field action and external forces, the transverse forces on the stiffeners required to enforce effective division of the web plate, and the tendency for the stiffened plate to buckle overall. Design criteria are established {{to ensure that the}} resulting stiffeners do not yield before plate failure, and that the plating is effectively divided into panels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to re-examine the Charpy V-Notch (CVN) base metal requirements and inspection requirements for steel bridges that contain at least one Fracture Critical Member (FCM). FCMs are defined as members that will cause global failure of the bridge if the FCM fails. Currently FCMs are required by federal law to be inspected with a hands on inspection every two years, although a waiver may be obtained in {{a limited amount of}} cases. Hands on inspections are conducted using only the human eye, where the distance between the human eye and the member is no greater than one an arm length. The flaw detection capabilities of the hands on inspection program are not known at this time. Future means of quantifying the probability of detecting a crack are discussed. This report will review the history of the Charpy V-Notch (CVN) test {{and the use of the}} CVN test in steel bridge material requirements. ^ Damage tolerant design is proposed as an alternative to current U. S. bridge material selection and inspection practice. A deterministic procedure is proposed instead of the reliability based procedures that have been proposed previously in the literature. This is because the distributions of the relevant variables are not known for steel bridges and inspectors. The Master Curve method, standard crack assessment procedures, and the finite element solver ABAQUS were used to investigate the critical crack size at a <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> weld toe. The lack of consistent fracture resistance among the various steel grades is shown. The <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> detail was chosen because it will most likely be the most fatigue prone detail in most new bridges. A new CVN requirement is proposed to eliminate the discrepancy among the grades. It is recommended that other welded details be investigated in the future. ^ There are many FCMs that have geometries that have not been previously investigated using modern procedures. A procedure for incorporating three dimensional finite element modeling and the standard crack assessment guides is proposed. The procedure is illustrated using a coverplate detail.

40|$|Slender plated girders {{are usually}} {{composed}} of slender webs and compact flanges. In {{order to increase}} their capacity, they are stiffened with <b>transverse</b> and longitudinal <b>stiffeners</b> of different shapes. Thin plated girders used to support loads over long spans develop significant post-critical resistance after the plate buckling occurs. To achieve better understanding of longitudinally stiffened plated girders subjected to high bending moments and shear forces, four experimental tests on large scale test specimens were performed. The results of these tests were used to verify the numerical model, which was employed for further parametric studies. With numerical simulations the influence of initial imperfections and residual stresses on the capacity of girders was investigated. Initial imperfections were considered as actual measured initial imperfections, as positive buckling modes and as deformed shapes, based on preliminary nonlinear calculations of perfect girders. Residual stresses were considered with a simplified stress pattern where the level of compression stresses was varied. The final residual stresses were determined {{on the basis of}} residual stresses measured in the tested girder. With a verified simplified numerical model a parametric nonlinear analysis was systematically carried out to determine the resistance of longitudinally stiffened plated girders. Based on 630 numerical simulations a new equation for interaction at high bending moments and shear forces, as well as the section, where the check should be performed is proposed. An extensive reliability analysis of five different design models was made, i. e., the EN 1993 - 1 - 5 interaction model, the proposed new model, the gross cross-section bending resistance model and two models, which are a combination of the first three. The purpose of this reliability analysis is to determine partial safety factors and study the adequacy of the EN 1993 - 1 - 5 resistance model. The studies have shown, that the capacity of longitudinally stiffened plated girders can satisfactory be determined according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5 under the condition, that the check is made at a distance hwi,max/ 2 and that the gross cross-section bending capacity includes safety factor �M 1 = 1, 1. Finally, the influence of the tension field action on intermediate <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> was studied. Two tests on a full scale girder were performed to determine the axial forces in <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Parametric study, where the influence of stiffener’s stiffnesses on the girders limit capacity was investigated, followed.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to determine the}} capacity against buckling of the main girder web at a launching stage. As the webs and the flanges of the main girder must defined as slender structural elements (class 4) instability will govern design resistance. The first part of the thesis will give the reader an understanding of the boundary conditions and phenomenon that will determine the loading conditions this steel girder is subjected to. All these observations will then be implemented to a nonlinear buckling analysis in ANSYS Workbench 12. 1. This particular analysis will be executed in order to satisfy design guidelines given in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5 : Plated structural elements 1 regarding material properties, imperfections and boundary conditions for this buckling phenomenon. With this type of analysis we can evaluate the post critical resistance of a plate. The geometry and loads which will be used as input in ANSYS will be retrieved from a reference project which is a MSS-system used to build a bridge in Portugal in 2004, project identification: 25111 - VIZELA CALVOS. After obtaining results from this analysis the main girder`s web panel will collapse at loading from the launching wagon equal to 3879 kN. This particular result was satisfying as it demonstrated that the web panel had enough capacity and that the stiffening arrangement proved to be efficient as it provoked a local buckling mode in a subpanel. The utilization of the web against instability was rather satisfying at this project. A request from Strukturas regarding additional nonlinear analysis with ANSYS obtained with a new stiffening arrangement was as well executed. This will provide useful information regarding capacity at other MSS projects. The alternative stiffening arrangement included a <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> rigid for shear buckling. With this configuration the collapse load was found to be 5832 kN. Including a <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> will provide this web with additional stiffness against instability. The main {{reason for this is that}} the stiffener will provide the web panel with additional restraint and the critical buckling modes must be obtained with unsymmetrical loading. This is as well evident in design codes in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5 where plate panels can be treated separately if rigid transverse stiffeners are implemented. These rigid transverse stiffeners will decrease the buckling length and subsequently increase resistance. When these nonlinear analysis were executed the next {{objective of the}} thesis is to study the design formulas in NS-EN 1993 1 - 5. It soon became evident that there were some important issues regarding the calculation of resistance due to patch loading. Concentrated transverse loading applied perpendicular to the flange in the plane of the web is referred to as patch loading in Eurocode 3 and would in this case be the support reaction from the launching wagon. The inner web of the main girder has a special configuration with <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> c/c 750 mm to add stiffness in these local regions at the flange and adjacent part of the web. As the ANSYS analysis state that the most critical mode is a local buckling mode between longitudinal stiffeners, the design formulas does not differ between failure modes. Bearing all this in mind that the transverse stiffeners configuration will contribute to spread the load at a larger area on the critical subpanel it`s safe to conclude that these design formulas must be discarded. The main girder`s web may as well suffer from instability due the influence of direct stresses and shear buckling. Their effect have been examined and it turns out that they will not govern the web resistance. These results were not unexpected because the main girder will experience a larger bending moment and support reactions at the concreting stage due to self weight of the concrete. As a consequence of these discoveries the nonlinear analysis in ANSYS will reflect that the patch loading will cause the most confusion regarding ULS capacity of the web panel...|$|E

Constant amplitude loading fatigue tests up to the LCF regime result in Wohler curves, which fulfill FAT class 80 (butt joints) and FAT 71 (<b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners)</b> according to the recommendations and can be estimated with a slope of k = 3. A fatigue life increase can be achieved by post weld treatment methods, even in the LCF regime. In addition to knowledge about the cyclic material behavior, the effect of a Gaussian spectrum on the fatigue life has to be considered. A fatigue life increase under variable amplitude loading is shown by Ga ss ner curves and characteristic damage sums resulting from a linear damage accumulation. The results have been extended to sample component investigations of tube-clevis connections. A fatigue assessment using local approaches confirms FAT 225 for the effective notch stress approach up to N 103 cycles. In addition an assessment is concluded considering the elastic-plastic material behavior and using damage parameters...|$|R

The phenomenological insight depicted in this paper shows the influence of the web thickness and the flange yield strength as well as the influence of the <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffeners</b> on the stress distribution, the critical loads and on the equilibrium path of this particular type of loading. A previously validated numerical model is used systematically as a simulation tool. Stress-, strain-, force- and displacement fields are exploited for the sake of inferring and idealizing the most valuable features of the depicted mechanical model...|$|R
40|$|Timber in nail-laminated and stress-laminated bridges {{is often}} {{installed}} with moisture contents (MC) near the fiber saturation point. Post-installation moisture loss induces shrinkage in the timber components, {{which results in}} loosening of component fasteners. This research project sought to establish the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of timber bridges in Minnesota. Researchers took seasonal MC measurements on six nail-laminated timber bridges to determine annual MC variations and moisture gradients in individual bridge components: three bridges from northern Minnesota in St. Louis County and three from southern Minnesota in Sibley County. An electrical resistance meter measured moisture content, with oven-dry and toluene distillation methods of MC determination as controls. The study found the average MC of bridge components in St. Louis County was 2 percent [...] 11 percent higher than bridge components in Sibley. The study determined the average MC at a three-inch depth on three of the major bridge components as: * Deck laminations 18 percent (Sibley) to 28 percent (St. Louis) * <b>Transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> beams 14 percent (Sibley) to 18 percent (St. Louis) * Deck supports 17 percent (Sibley) to 27 percent (St. Louis). * The {{results indicate that the}} regional microclimate may greatly affect MC. Results from this research will allow MC specifications to be determined before bridge installation, helping minimize post-installation moisture-related problems and optimize design calculations. In addition, results will provide necessary data for ongoing research on transverse load-sharing characteristics of longitudinally nail-laminated timber bridges. Finally, this information will provide a basis for inspecting MC in timber bridges. Center for Transportation StudiesLocal Road Research Boar...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Fracture mechanics approach has been used to analyze the behavior of fatigue resistance of welded details existing in highway steel bridges under variable amplitude long life loading which means most of the stress ranges will be below constant amplitude fatigue limit. First of all, fracture mechanics models are established based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. Two methods are employed to compute the crack growth and fatigue life under variable amplitude fatigue long life loading. They are direct cycle-by-cycle integration method and simplified summation method. The general behavior of long life fatigue of welded details such as cover plate, web attachment, and <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> are studied and discussed. The effect of the initial flaw size, the stress concentration, and the small stress ranges on the long life fatigue is discussed {{based on the results of}} fracture mechanics analysis. The Q parameter is defined for the long life loading in order to characterize the fatigue limit effect and provide reasonable estimates of fatigue life, The relationship found between the Q parameter and fatigue lives based on the S-N curves can be easily applied to accumulated fatigue damage estimates for welded details in highway steel bridges. The application of this method for highway steel bridges shows that the fatigue limit effect can be very significant that the current design approach might be affected if the beneficial effect of fatigue limit would be taken into account...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. While the NCBRP program has evaluated the fatigue strength for many of the welded details that are typically used in highway bridge construction, only those details which {{have been the subject of}} recent research projects are specified in the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (1992). Many existing details resemble those currently covered by specification, but closer inspection of these details reveals inherent differences. A coped longitudinal attachment intersecting a <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffener</b> is an example of such a detail. In order to measure the severity of different intersection geometries, the finite element stress analysis method was used in order to obtain the SCF for each detail. The SCF for each coped detail was compared to that of a base model with no cope. The non coped model signifies the SCF that correlates to an AASHTO Category E detail. The SCF for a Category C detail was also obtained. The severity of the cope detail was determined by the relationship of its SCF to the SCF of the Category C and E detail. The studied parameters for this investigation were gusset plate width, size of the cope, and the thickness of the gusset and web plate. From this investigation several conclusions could be made. The cope in the longitudinal plate should not be smaller than one inch. Smaller gap sizes can reduce the fatigue strength of the detail when compared to a slightly larger cope size. As the cope size is reduced, the two welds come close together and the SCF for each weld toe superimposed on each other. The close proximity of the weld can also lead to large restraint forces in the weld region, which also reduces the detail's fatigue strength. The best possible category for a detail with a cope is Category D. However, depending on the size of the cope and thickness ratio between the plate and web, this category can be reduced to Category E. An equation was developed that would predict the AASHTO fatigue category for a given plate width, cope size, and thickness ratio...|$|E
