25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> and wanted lunch, {{she thought it was}} Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

In the film, one of Boo's drawings is covered with the name [...] "Mary".

50|$|Philly becomes {{infatuated}} with Nicole. When she spots him peeping into her room, {{she tells him}} <b>to</b> close <b>her</b> <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> Philly's utter shock, she means for him <b>to</b> close <b>her</b> <b>door</b> from the inside and then watch her undress. However, it {{is too much for}} him when a topless Nicole asks him <b>to</b> touch <b>her</b> breasts. When he objects, she steps back and instead takes off her panties. Philly panics and leaves.|$|R
60|$|In {{all this}} trouble and perplexity she {{had no one to}} whom she could turn for advice and assistance. If she told Mrs. Cliff there was a Rackbird in Paris, and that he had been making threats, she was sure that good lady would fly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> home in Plainton, Maine, where she would have iron bars put to all the windows, and double locks <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} [...] (Mustela nigripes), {{also known as}} the American polecat or prairie dog hunter, is a species of {{mustelid}} native to central North America. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN, because of its very small and restricted populations. First discovered by Audubon and Bachman in 1851, the species declined throughout the 20th century, primarily as a result of decreases in prairie dog populations and sylvatic plague. It was declared extinct in 1979 until Lucille Hogg's dog brought a dead black-footed ferret <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> in Meeteetse, Wyoming in 1981. That remnant population of a few dozen ferrets lasted there until the animals were considered extinct in the wild in 1987. However, a captive breeding program launched by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service resulted in its reintroduction into eight western states and Mexico from 1991 to 2008. There are now over 1,000 mature, wild-born individuals in the wild across 18 populations, with four self-sustaining populations in South Dakota (two), Arizona and Wyoming. It was first listed as 'Endangered' in 1982, then listed as 'Extinct in the Wild' in 1996 before being downgraded back to 'Endangered' in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{while at}} home, Peyton yells at Brooke {{that she did}} not ruin their friendship; Brooke ruined it a long time ago. Following this, Peyton decides to skip prom, but gets {{convinced}} not to do so by Lucas. As she walks <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> to answer it (thinking it is Lucas), the man behind the door turns around and it is actually her stalker, Psycho Derek. He ties her up and gags her in her basement and proceeds to make a mock prom for them; he takes pictures of the bound and gagged Peyton, dancing with her and telling her they are gonna [...] "go upstairs and have the perfect prom night". Brooke arrives, knowing that Peyton would never skip prom. Psycho Derek tries to kill Brooke, but Peyton and Brooke eventually defeat him and he ends up in jail. This experience repairs Peyton and Brooke's friendship. Peyton learns that Psycho Derek's real name is Ian Banks. She forgives him after discovering disturbing facts about his past, and tells him that she hopes he finds peace. Lucas and Peyton eventually have sex together for the first time. After making sure with Lucas, Peyton decides to take an internship in L.A. and thus spends the whole summer with Brooke.|$|E

60|$|I told her, that if {{she would}} take my advice, I would tell her how she should obtain her wishes in both those things, and that I would engage I would bring the man <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> again, and make him beg to be let in.

60|$|For {{a moment}} of despairing shock, before the storm broke, Lenore blindly wavered there, unable {{to move from the}} spot that had seen the {{beginning}} and the end of her brief hour of love. Then she summoned strength to drag herself <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room, <b>to</b> lock <b>her</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|That won her consent, {{and after}} seeing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>door,</b> Eden went {{on his way}} rejoicing, for so far the gods he had once spoken of had shown {{themselves}} favourable.|$|R
