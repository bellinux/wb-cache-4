This paper addresses a comparison between multiple unicast and multicast traffic congestion control for Carrier Ethernet. In this work, we proposed to study the Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN), which is a Layer 2 congestion control scheme, {{in the case of}} multicast traffic and multiple unicast traffic. Indeed, the QCN has recently been standardized as the IEEE 802. 1 Qau Ethernet Congestion Notification standard. This scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, which are implemented by the OMNeT++ framework. This paper evaluates the Reaction Point (RP) start <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> detection, feedback <b>rate,</b> loss rate, stability, fairness and scalability performance of the QCN for mul-ticast traffic transmission and multiple unicast traffic transmission. This paper also draws a parallel between QCN for multicast traffic transmission and that for multiple unicast traffic transmission. Despite the benefit of integrating the multi-cast traffic, results show that performance could degrade when the network scales up. The evaluation results also show that it is probable that the feedback implo-sion problem caused by the bottlenecks could be solved if we choose to set the queue parameter Qeq threshold value at a high value, 3 / 4 of the queue capacity for instance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of court {{congestion}} in Indian lower courts. We use several measures to capture court congestion. These include: caseloads per capita and per judge, {{the number of cases}} older than a year per capita and per judge, and <b>congestion</b> <b>rates</b> calculated as the ratio of cases older than a year to cases disposed. We conclude that the Indian state judiciaries differ with respect to the nature and the level of congestion. We can also identify the reasons why some judiciaries are more congested than others. The results show that the large number of judges per capita is negatively related to <b>congestion</b> <b>rates,</b> while judgeship vacancies {{have a positive effect on}} caseloads per judge. Court productivity captured by the clearance rates has a significant and negative effect on both caseloads and <b>congestion</b> <b>rates</b> and seems to be crucial for the effectiveness of congestion-reduction programs. Finally, judiciaries with lower litigation rates display a relatively better performance with respect to current caseloads, but are not efficient in addressing the ï¿½realï¿½ backlogs of cases pending for more than a year.

ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the multiserver loss queuing model recently developed by Peake and Pearce (that extends the classical Poisson model to general arrival time distributions) in deriving bounds on traffic service in the Modernised High Frequency Communication System (MHFCS) being built for the Australian Defence Force. The MHFCS is a four-node virtual high frequency (HF) network that interconnects land-based users with mobile land, sea and air platforms. The problem of maximal <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is considered for this system, where general arrival-time distributions can be used to model different traffic classes, where individual voice call and data traffic iteminter-arrival times are identically and independently distributed. The service facility (viz Network Management Node) consists of a fixed number of homogeneous servers (channels) in parallel, each characterized by independent exponential service times. An arrival finding no server available is lost. The <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is the equilibrium proportion of the time that all the servers are busy. Of additional interest are the associated optimisation problems of finding the arrival time distribution functions that maximise and minimise the <b>time</b> <b>congestion,</b> and the corresponding minimal and maximal congestion values. 1.

This paper presents a congestion propagation model based on SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) epidemic model for capturing the congestion prorogation process through formalizing the propagation by a congestion susceptibility recovery process. In addition, as congestion propagation {{is the key}} parameter in the congestion propagation model, a model for calculating <b>congestion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> is constructed. A gray system model is also introduced to quantify the propagation rate under the joint effect of six influential factors: passenger flow, train headway, passenger transfer convenience, <b>time</b> of <b>congestion</b> occurring, initial congested station and station capacity. A numerical example is used to illustrate the congestion propagation process and to demonstrate the improvements after taking corresponding measures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Engset {{model has}} been {{extensively}} studied and widely used for blocking probability evaluation in telecom-munications networks. In 1957, J. W. Cohen considered two generalizations of the Engset model: 1) Permitting the distributions of the holding time and inter-arrival time to differ from source to source; 2) Permitting the idle time distribution to depend {{on whether or not}} the previous call was successful. He derived the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> for the first general-ization, however, he simply posed the second generalization as a problem. In a leading teletraffic text by Syski, the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> are approximated for the second generalization, though it appears that Syski has overlooked that his results are in fact an approximation. In this paper, we point out Syski’s apparent oversight, we improve the accuracy of his approximation, and we provide an efficient algorithm for its numerical computation and prove its convergence.

40|$|In this lesson, {{we learn}} about models used for {{circuit-switched}} networks. We start with an M/M/m/ m model, also called the m-server loss system [1]. We note here that [2], page 379 states that a system with a finite customer population will always be stable, no matter what value of ρ. This statement is made for any finite state space MC. Does this explain why in M/M/m/m model we often talk about ρ being 1, 10, 100 - see [3], pg. 235. Unlike in the M/M/m case, here ρ or offered load is defined to be λ ⁄ µ. In the M/M/m case, recall, we defined ρ to be λ ⁄ (mµ). In Section 1, we derive the Erlang-B formula for an infinite population. In Section 2, we derive the simple <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> or blocking probability for a finite population model, called the Engset for-mula. In Section 3, we show the difference between call congestion or call loss probability and <b>time</b> <b>congestion.</b> For these two sections, refer to [6], page 518 - 521. Both [4] and [6] refer to [5] for the dif-ference between <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> and call congestion. Section 4 describes the recursion formulation for numerically computing the Engset call loss probabilities from [4]. Section 5 derives the Blocked Call Queueing (BCQ) equations. Only the system in Section 1 is characterized using the queueing theory notation. In Sections 2 - 5, we are modeling {{a system in which}} the number of sources is limited. There is no place to indicate the number of sources from which jobs arrive in the Kendall notation. The last two numbers are for num-ber of servers, and number of jobs in the system. Thus the BCQ derivation for mean waiting delay is different from the mean delay derivations for M/M/ 1, M/M/m type queues that we learned in an ear-lier lesson. This lesson is entirely on the single-link case and is hence more about TDM/FDM sharing on a single link rather than circuit-switched networks...|$|R

We also proposed a novel parsimonious mathematical representation of macroparasite distribution, <b>congestion</b> <b>rate,</b> which i) is easier to use than traditional models, and ii) is based on Malthusian parameters rather than probability theory. Heavy infections of Myxobolus insidiosus (Myxozoa) and metacercariae of Nanophyetus salmincola and Apophallus sp. occurred in parr (subyearlings) from the lower mainstem of this river collected in 2007 and 2008. Smolts (yearlings) collected in 2006 - 2009 always harbored fewer Apophallus sp. with host mortality recognized as a function of intensity for this parasite. Mean intensity of Apophallus sp. in lower mainstem parr was 753 per fish in 2007 and 856 per fish in 2008, while parr from the tributaries had a mean of only 37 or 13 parasites per fish, respectively. Mean intensity of this parasite in smolts ranged between 47 - 251 parasites per fish. Over-dispersion (variance to mean ratios) of Apophallus sp. was always lower in smolts compared with all parr combined or lower mainstem parr.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} expected impact of raising the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) allowed in the Marunouchi-Otemachi business district of Tokyo from the current 1000 % to 2000 % by estimating changes {{in the degree of}} commuting congestion and then calculating, in monetary terms, the resulting increase in the cost of worker fatigue. If the FAR is raised to 2000 %, the daytime population (i. e., the number of people working) in the district is expected to increase from the current 153, 000 to a maximum of 429, 000, an increase of 276, 000. Based on this projection, the author forecasts changes in the <b>rates</b> of commuting <b>congestion</b> for each station-to-station section of the Tokyo Metropolitan area by making the following two assumptions: 1) the peak concentration ratio (i. e., the ratio of the number of people getting off trains during the one-hour peak commuting time to the total number of people getting off at the same station over an entire day) and the unit of concentration (i. e., the ratio of commuter pass users to the total number of people working in the district) remain unchanged; and 2) people commuting to work in the area subject to the eased FAR regulation continue to live in the same place and use the same commuting route. The results show that the average peak-time <b>congestion</b> <b>rate</b> in the most congested sections along the 34 major commuting routes in the metropolitan area increased from the current 179 % to 187 %, a rise of 8 percentage points. In fiscal 2000, the corresponding <b>congestion</b> <b>rate</b> stood at 212 %. Thus, the expected rise in <b>congestion</b> <b>rates</b> resulting from an easing of the FAR regulation would offset roughly one-fourth of the decrease in congestion from fiscal 2000 to the present. Next, using the worker fatigue cost function estimated by Yamaga and Hatta (2000), the author calculates the increments in the fatigue cost for all the station-to-station sections in the metropolitan area. The annual incremental cost for the metropolitan area totaled � 43 billion. By route, the JR Tokaido line has the largest incremental cost at � 7. 7 billion. In easing the FAR regulation for the Marunouchi-Otemachi district, the government should, at the same time, provide incentives to encourage railway operators to invest in enhanced transportation capacity - improvements to the safety system to enable greater frequency of service, introduction of more double-decker trains, and so forth - to minimize the negative effects of the relaxation of the FAR regulation. ...|$|R
