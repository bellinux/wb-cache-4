40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) is {{of great}} {{interest}} in photonic applications due to its wide bandgap (3. 37 eV) and high exciton binding energy (60 meV). In the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ZnO, typically one U V band-edge emission peak and one or more peaks at the visible spectral range due to defect emission are observed. The PL emission of ZnO is commonly green, but other colors like yellow and orange are also reported. Out of the different visible peaks, {{the origin of the}} green one is the most controversial. The most commonly cited explanation for it is the transition between a singly oxidized oxygen vacancy and a photoexcited hole [K. Vanheusden, C. H. Seager, W. L. Warren, D. R. Tallant, and J. A. Voigt, Appl. Phys. Lett. 68, 403 (1996). ]. However, <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>established</b> on ZnO phosphors but not on nanostructured samples. In this work, several ZnO nanostructures (nanorods, nanoneedles, nanoshells and tetrapod nanorods) were synthesized by thermal evaporation and chemical methods. The obtained nanostructures were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL), and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). It was found that fabrication methods significantly affect the defect emissions of the nanostructures. For different fabrication conditions, defect emissions in the green, yellow, and orange spectral ranges were observed. No correlation was found between the deep levels responsible for the visible emission and the EPR signal. Origins of the different defect emissions are discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The tourism {{industry}} has been considerably affected by the global economic crisis over the most recent years, with its roots identified in the US mortgage market segment. This crisis has caused fluctuations in the markets across all industries, triggering uncertainty in nearly every businessperson in the Czech Republic. By their nature, tourist services are non-essential products, used by customers to satisfy their needs only. Thus, in those times of uncertainty, customers tend {{to cut down on}} these services to a certain minimum level. This fact manifested itself during the crisis in 2007 – 2012. The article presents the impact of the global crisis on the {{tourism industry}}, in particular, on accommodation providers in the Olomouc region. The aim of the article was to explore the impact of this crisis on management of group accommodation facilities. The introductory chapter discusses the theoretical aspect of the economic crisis and its relations with company management, as well as the impact of the crisis on provision of accommodation services in the reference period across the nation. Following <b>this,</b> <b>hypotheses</b> <b>are</b> <b>established,</b> to <b>be</b> subsequently assessed by means of the primary research run as the questionnaire poll in the Olomouc region.

The Antennapedia (ANTP) -class is one of the two major classes of animal homeobox genes, and includes the Hox genes, renowned for their role in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of animals. The origin and evolution of the ANTP-class genes are a matter of some debate.

Our comparison of gene organization in Platynereis dumerilii and chordates indicates that the Mega-cluster, if it did exist, had already been broken up onto four chromosomes {{by the time of the}} protostome-deuterostome ancestor (PDA). These results not only elucidate an aspect of the genome organization of the PDA but also reveal high levels of macrosynteny between P. dumerilii and chordates.

By examining earlier presidential elections the study views how economic crises affect voters and unites them based on the necessity of a change in economic politics. Furthermore the paper shows how important a sense of loyalty towards a party can be, as well as how primary groups can have a political effect on American voters. The study concludes that a correlation can be found between inequality and election results, although that cannot explain the polarization alone.

Much attention has focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2] and the Y chromosome [3, 4], both of which escape recombination and so provide information on maternal and paternal lineages, respectively. It is often assumed that the polymorphisms observed at loci on mtDNA and the Y chromosome are selectively neutral and, therefore, that existing patterns of molecular variation can be used to deduce the histories of populations in terms of drift, population movements, and cultural practices. The coalescence of the molecular phylogenies of mtDNA and the Y chromosome to recent common ancestors in Africa [5, 6], for example, has been taken to reflect a recent origin of modern human populations in Africa. An alternative explanation, though, could be the recent selective spread of mtDNA and Y chromosome haplotypes from Africa in a population with a more complex history [7]. It is therefore important to <b>establish</b> whether there <b>are</b> selective differences between classes (haplotypes) of mtDNA and Y chromosomes and, if so, whether these differences could have been sufficient to influence the distributions of haplotypes in existing populations.

Although studies of nucleotide diversity in global samples of Y chromosomes have suggested an absence of recent selective sweeps or bottlenecks [9], selection may, in principle, be very important for the Y chromosome because it carries several loci affecting male fertility [10, 11] and as many as 5 % of males are infertile [11, 12].

In particular, it examines an hypothetical exporting firm with costs in domestic currency, which faces competition from foreign firms in overseas markets and has a market share expansion objective. Within <b>this</b> framework, the <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>established</b> that economic exposure, portrayed in a diagram connecting export prices and real exchange rates, is asymmetric (i. e. the negative effects depreciation are higher than the positive effects of a currency depreciation). In this case, export business can be seen as a real option, given by exporting firms to overseas customer. Different scenarios about the asymmetry <b>hypothesis</b> can <b>be</b> derived for different assumptions about the determinants of economic exposure.

The vast majority of the researchers was primarily focused on the local immunomodulatory role of UVR. But today evidence is increasing in favor of plural immune activation and systemic reaction of the organism. Most of the attention is directed toward the regulatory T lymphocytes which are responsible for the local and systemic immunosuppressive response under the impact of sunlight. The role of regulatory T cells in autoimmune diseases is well studied on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Epidemiological research shows a proportional interdependence of latitude and prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is evidence that UVR has direct influence on the level of antibodies against the SNF 2 -superfamily helicase (Mi- 2), distinctive for dermatomyositis (DM).

So, this study is geared towards emphasizing its importance of application, and attempts to analyze, how organic architecture is achieved its essence, the way it is interesting dealing with the sense of flowing spaces, and its subtle relationship with natural metaphors.

40|$|Paper I: Corporate {{aging and}} {{internal}} resource allocation Abstract Various observers argue that <b>established</b> firms <b>are</b> {{at a disadvantage}} in pursuing new growth opportunities. In this paper, we provide systematic evidence that established firms allocate fewer resources to high-growth lines of business. However, we find no evidence of inefficient resource allocation in established firms. Redirecting resources from high-growth to low-growth lines of business does not result in lower profitability. Also, resource allocation towards new growth opportunities does not increase when managers of <b>established</b> firms <b>are</b> exposed to takeover and product market threats. Rather, it seems that conservative resource allocation strategies are driven by pressures to meet investors’ expectations. Our empirical evidence, thus, favors the hypothesis that established firms wisely choose to allocate fewer resources to new growth opportunities as external pressures force them to focus on efficiency rather than novelty (Holmström 1989). Paper II: Corporate aging and asset sales Abstract This paper asks whether divestitures are motivated by strategic considerations about {{the scope of the}} firm’s activities. Limited managerial capacity implies that exploiting core competences becomes comparatively more attractive than exploring new growth opportunities as firms mature. Divestitures help stablished firms free management time and increase the focus on core competences. The testable implication of <b>this</b> attention <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> that <b>established</b> firms <b>are</b> the main sellers of assets, that their divestiture activity increases when managerial capacity is scarcer, that they sell non-core activities, and that they return the divestiture proceeds to the providers of capital instead of reinvesting them in the firm. We find strong empirical support for these predictions. Paper III: Corporate aging and lobbying expenditures Abstract Creative destruction forces constantly challenge established firms, especially in competitive markets. This paper asks whether corporate lobbying is a competitive weapon of established firms to counteract the decline in rents over time. We find a statistically and economically significant positive relation between firm age and lobbying expenditures. Moreover, the documented age-effect is weaker when firms have unique products or operate in concentrated product markets. To address endogeneity, we use industry distress as an exogenous nonlegislative shock to future rents and show that <b>established</b> firms <b>are</b> relatively more likely to lobby when in distress. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that corporate lobbying efforts by established firms forestall the creative destruction process. In sum, our findings suggest that corporate lobbying is a competitive weapon of established firms to retain profitability in competitive environments...|$|R
40|$|We {{are now in}} the 21 st {{century and}} each {{organisation}} is forced to be on the move and be dynamic, and this depends on the motivation of those working in the organisation in question. In any profession, and nursing is no exception, motivation at work is immediately reflected in everyone´s performance at work. The aim of this thesis was to chart the work motivation factors which support the decision to follow a nursing career and to map the use of motivational programmes by hospital management. Five <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> <b>established</b> {{on the basis of these}} aims. Hypothesis 1 : General nurses are motivated to pursue their career; <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed, as more than half of all nurses are satisfied with thein current positions and do not plan to leave their jobs within the next six years. Hypothesis 2 : The main motivational factor to pursue a nursing career <b>is</b> salary assessment. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. <b>This</b> factor ranked sekond out of a total of sixteen. Hypothesis 3 : For general nurses the prestige of the jo bis a motivational factor. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> refuted; <b>this</b> factor ranked as the thirteenth most important. Hypothesis 4 : General nurses see the possibility of further education as a motivational factor. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. 89 % of those questioned see this as a very important factor. Hypothesis 5 : Hospitals have elaborated motivational programmes. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> refuted. A qualitative examination of each of the interviews showed that the hospitals in question do not have motivational programmes. For the top management of hospitals these results can serve as impetus to implement new motivational programmes or procedures for assessing work performance and the effectiveness of educational activities in places where they are not yet in place...|$|R
