The Wembley stadium's pitch was in very poor condition with the Horse of the Year Show having taken place there a week previously.|$|E
25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because {{there was not much}} time left in the match and wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E
2500|$|A keeper's {{position}} {{depends on}} the bowler: for fast bowling he will squat {{some distance from the}} stumps, in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as [...] "standing up"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to [...] "stand up", for instance Godfrey Evans often stood up to Alec Bedser.|$|E

30|$|Also in Table  4, we {{summarize}} teachers’ self-report {{data from}} the survey on prompts related <b>to</b> <b>having</b> enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan for all their content areas, to plan for mathematics or science instruction, to investigate additional resources, and to meet with other teachers about mathematics or science instruction. The first of these factors is significant for both mathematics and science, such that specialists are more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan {{for all of the}} subjects they teach. It is important to recognize that, even for these specialists, the mean is low, less than 3 for both content areas on a 1 – 6 scale. In mathematics, EMS are significantly more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan for their mathematics instruction. Although not statistically significant, specialists also are more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> investigate additional resources related to their mathematics or science instruction. Thus, the specialists’ indications of having more specialized content-focused planning time and the affordances that this provides are supported by the self-report survey data.|$|R

2500|$|In November 1962, Birmingham voters {{changed the}} city's form of government. Rather than at-large {{election}} of three commissioners, who had specific oversight of certain city departments, {{there would be}} a mayor-council form of government. Members of the city council were to be elected from nine single-member districts. Blacks were still largely disenfranchised. The city had changed its government in response to the extremely negative perception of the city. It had been derisively nicknamed [...] "Bombingham," [...] by outsiders for numerous attacks on civil rights activists and blacks moving into new areas of the city. For instance, in 1961 when the president of the city's Chamber of Commerce was visiting Japan, he saw a newspaper photo of a bus engulfed in flames, which occurred during the Freedom Rides. Bull Connor arranged for opponents <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attack civil rights activists when their bus reached Birmingham.|$|E

2500|$|He {{established}} his own practice, {{at the same}} time becoming active in the local Democratic party. Gowen served as Schuylkill County's elected D.A. (1862–64), though in that period, according to his generally sympathetic biographer, he was [...] "doing too well with his private practice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bother with prosecuting criminals." [...] Others argue that Gowen would have diligently prosecuted numerous cases but for his suspects uniformly being furnished with alibis by fellow criminals, some of whom he brought to justice two decades later as Mollie Maguires. [...] Whatever Gowen's personal attitude towards his official duties, the climate in Schuylkill County at the time was less than conducive to normal conduct of criminal investigations: First, at that time an elected county sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer. [...] Second, and much to the point during Gowen's tenure, in July 1863, roughly the midpoint of his D.A. service and of the Civil War, a national conscription act was passed to bolster Union forces. The eruption of anti-draft riots in New York and other cities threatened to replicate in Schuylkill County as well. [...] Threats and violence, including murder, occurred in several localities. [...] Federal troops were deployed to the county to face down these fierce anti-draft feelings and disruptions, and finally conscription was effected under military force. [...] When his own draft number came up that same year, Gowen—by then a father of three—was well-off enough to pay for a substitute, a common practice among those who could afford it.|$|E

2500|$|Relaxation therapy {{can reduce}} {{cognition}} and motivations to act out, and through relaxation, clients gain coping skills to better manage their anger. This therapy addresses {{various aspects of}} anger such as physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social. These aspects combined are what make relaxation an effective treatment for anger. The mindfulness therapy technique attempts to teach clients acceptance of bodily sensations and emotions. Mindfulness originated in Eastern spiritual traditions that are practiced through meditation. A two-prong component of mindfulness includes: self-regulation and orientation toward the present moment. The center of this therapy technique is experiencing the present moment in a non-judgmental manner that is reflective of meditation. In practice, clients observe breathing, sitting and walking during meditations. The goal is for clients to understand {{that his or her}} thoughts of anger are merely thoughts rather than reality. Mindfulness is also a technique used in the relaxation approach, because the technique halts physiological arousal. Rational emotive behavior therapy explains anger through the client's beliefs and emotion, rather than the event itself. The concept involves clients interpreting events in a rational manner in order to avoid irrational thoughts that lead to anger. Delayed reaction technique is when clients attempt to uncover what is making them angry before acting out on their anger. This allows them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> change what is making them angry and increase time before their response; this encourages thought on a more rational level. In addition, clients are also encouraged to avoid demands in an anti-oppressive order to avoid anger. An example of a demand placed on a client may be that, [...] "I have to have this done by my standards". Research is starting to show that the better individuals understand what anger management is and how it can help them personally and in relationships, aggressive actions are less likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present {{preliminary}} results of numerical modeling {{of the combined}} effects of ICM stripping and galaxy collisions on galaxies in clusters. We use the Hydra adaptive mesh, P 3 M + SPH code of Couchman et al. (1995). Generally, the formation of extended tidal and splash structures in galaxy interactions will facilitate ram pressure stripping. ICM compression of massive clouds stripped from tails and plumes may produce significant populations of free-floating star clusters or dwarf galaxies. There has been suggestions in the literature that galaxy collisions are {{more common in the}} environment of galaxy clusters (e. g., Fried 1988, Rubin, Waterman & Kenney 1999). The cumulative effects of long range tidal disturbances, i. e., galaxy harrassment, can produce some similar results (see Moore et al. 1996), and so complicates the interpretation of observation. However, secular processes are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> affect gas-rich galaxies in groups or subclusters falling into large clusters. In this case cluster potential may induce interactions...|$|R
