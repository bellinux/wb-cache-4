25|$|For most foods, such as rice, {{the typical}} {{person would be}} unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product.

25|$|A fibre {{obtained}} from the leaves is used for making paper. The leaves are harvested in late summer after the plant has flowered, they are scraped to remove the outer skin, and are then soaked in water for two hours prior <b>to</b> <b>cooking.</b> The fibres are cooked for 24 hours with lye and then beaten in a blender. They make a light tan brown paper.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture <b>to</b> <b>cooking</b> at high temperature than is goose foie gras ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose foie gras employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive <b>to</b> <b>cooking.</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found {{inconsistent}} results on the association between asthma in children and gas cooking emissions. We aimed to assess {{the effects of the}} long-term exposure <b>to</b> gas <b>cooking</b> on the onset of asthma and respiratory symptoms, focusing on wheezing, in children from two German birth cohorts: LISAplus and GINIplus. A total of 5078 children were followed until the age of 10 years. Asthma, wheezing, gas <b>cooking,</b> and exposure <b>to</b> other indoor factors were assessed through parental reported questionnaires administered periodically. Logistic and multinomial regressions adjusting for potential confounders were performed. The prevalence of asthma and persistent wheezing was higher among children exposed <b>to</b> gas <b>cooking</b> but the results were not statistically significant. Exposure <b>to</b> gas <b>cooking</b> was positively associated (P-value < 0. 05) with exposure to other indoor factors (dampness, environmental tobacco smoke, and pets). Our results did not show a statistically significant association between the exposure <b>to</b> gas <b>cooking</b> and children's respiratory health. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Mayu Miyano is the {{childhood}} friend of Takashi, who lives {{directly across the}} street from her house. She is depicted as a shy, clumsy, yet busty girl with glasses. Mayu has feelings for Takashi but doesn't have the courage to confess to him, instead she tends to revert <b>to</b> <b>cooking.</b> Because of her close history with Takashi and her relatively large bust size, she is perceived by Yamada as a rival, although Takeshita considers her totally sexually innocent and a virgin. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa in Japanese, and by Jad Saxton in English.|$|E
25|$|Firm {{and fresh}} {{blossoms}} {{that are only}} slightly open are cooked to be eaten, with pistils removed from female flowers, and stamens removed from male flowers. The stems on the flowers can be retained {{as a way of}} giving the cook something to hold onto during cooking, rather than injuring the delicate petals, or they can be removed prior <b>to</b> <b>cooking,</b> or prior to serving. There are a variety of recipes in which the flowers may be deep fried as fritters or tempura (after dipping in a light tempura batter), stuffed, sautéed, baked, or used in soups.|$|E

Also in July 2006, Blumenthal was the first chef to be awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In December 2013, Blumenthal was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of London, recognising his pioneering research and achievements in his field.|$|E

25|$|British usage, barbecuing {{refers to}} a fast cooking process done {{directly}} over high heat, while grilling refers <b>to</b> <b>cooking</b> under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. In American English usage, grilling {{refers to a}} fast process over high heat while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian churrasco and the Argentine asado.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2012 that the band had completed work for the third album, scheduled for a release later that year. The band also revealed {{that they will be}} supporting Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds on their UK Arena tour in spring. Details on the album are sketchy, but McClure has stated it will be produced by Jason Cox and James Dring (Gorillaz) and Youth (The Verve, U2) and will move away from the political-minded nature of the band's second album. The band also announced they had signed <b>to</b> <b>Cooking</b> Vinyl Records. McClure also stated that ex-Milburn and current The Book Club frontman Joe Carnall was to join the band, as well as ex-thisGirl drummer Ryan Jenkinson.|$|E
25|$|Coordinated {{words are}} {{normally}} written separately (with a comma). If {{the meaning of}} the result is {{different from that of the}} two words together, but both elements take suffixes, they are written with a hyphen (e.g. süt-főz ‘cook’, consisting of words referring <b>to</b> <b>cooking</b> in the oven and cooking in water, sütnek-főznek ‘they cook’). A hyphen is needed in cases when a phrase is only used with certain suffixes. Connections of words which are completely fused and thus take suffixes only at the end of the second element are written as one word (e.g. búbánat ‘sorrow and grief’, búbánatos ‘stricken with sorrow and grief’). However, there are phrases that only take suffixes at the end but their elements are still connected with a hyphen, as when words are contrasted (e.g. édes-bús ‘bittersweet’). Certain phrases can be suffixed either at the end of both elements or only at the end of the second element (e.g. hírnév ‘fame’: hírneve or híre-neve ‘his/her/its fame’).|$|E
