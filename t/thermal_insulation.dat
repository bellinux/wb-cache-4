However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack.

It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E

The thermal resistance and conductivity of all the analysed samples were measured according to the procedure indicated in the ISO 8032 standard. A Life-Cycle Assessment according to ISO 14040 was also performed to evaluate the environmental impacts related with the production of these materials. The results show that cardboard panels are a material with thermal and environmental properties on par with contemporary <b>thermal</b> <b>insulations.</b> Depending on their structure the measured thermal conductivity varies from 0. 05 to 0. 12 W·m- 1 ·K- 1 and their environmental impacts are much lower than those of polyisocyanurate foam or mineral wool.

5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation,</b> the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E

This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation,</b> conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E

40|$|Vegetal {{materials}} {{were one of}} the first construction materials used by humans, but the development of petrol-based synthetic materials in the last century replaced them in mainstream construction techniques. However, since environmental impact and resource depletion are increasingly becoming a central issue, vegetal materials are revisited. Natural <b>thermal</b> <b>insulations</b> are mainly developed from woody materials and industrial fibres, but these raw materials are not always locally available. Thus, the use of crop by-products is proposed here. The availability of crop by-products to be used as raw materials for building <b>thermal</b> <b>insulations</b> in Spain is evaluated. It is then compared to demand forecasts based on two different scenarios. Results vary greatly from one scenario to another, but they indicate that the amount of crop by-products is sufficient to meet estimated demand. Barley and wheat straw are by far the most abundant by-products, followed by corn, rice and sunflowers. Available corn by-products would be sufficient to insulate between 250, 000 and 450, 000 dwellings yearlyPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation.</b> In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation.</b> This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed {{a few weeks before}} the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E

5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air is cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E

The thermal response of these materials after exposure to cyclic aeroconvective heating from a plasma arc is described. The <b>thermal</b> <b>insulations</b> evaluated were Composite Flexible Blanket Insulations composed of an outer layer of aluminoborosilicate fabric and alumina insulation.

Insulations were exposed three, six, or nine times in order to demonstrate reusability and to determine the effect oi coatings on the surface durability of these insulations. Test results demonstrated the capability of these insulations to protect either composite or metallic structures from high heating environments. It is shown that high emittance coatings reduce backface temperatures. The durability of these insulations when impacted at low velocities was also demonstrated. The interaction of the coatings with the ceramic fibers was characterized. An analytical thermal model was utilized to correlate experimental thermal test results with calculated values...|$|R
