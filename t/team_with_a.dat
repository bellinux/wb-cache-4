5|$|As a freshman, VanVleet contributed {{double digit}} scoring twice (versus Gonzaga and Ohio State) in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament from {{off the bench}} as the 2012–13 Shockers team reached the final four.

5|$|Bolton's cup run started slowly, with {{a replay}} {{required}} to overcome non-league Reading. A 4–1 victory over Southampton secured a quarter-final berth at Sheffield United. As a Second Division <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poor away record, Wanderers were clear underdogs in the quarter-final, particularly {{in view of}} Sheffield United's strong home form. Nevertheless, Bolton prevailed 2–0 courtesy of goals by Sam Marsh and Billy Yenson. At this point Marsh had scored in every round of the competition. A 1–0 defeat of Derby County in the semi-final took Bolton to the final.|$|E

5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> predominantly red kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. The Australian {{selectors}} sought to accommodate Hayden, {{who had been}} successful as a Test opener, into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the <b>team.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> newly fragile top-order, Australia failed {{to qualify for the}} finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist's four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath's {{final game}} of January was a 3–1 defeat of Burton Swifts in the Birmingham Cup.

5|$|Taylor {{took over}} as manager of Derby County in November 1982, to the great {{surprise}} of {{most people in the}} game. He brought in Roy McFarland as his assistant, and signed Archie Gemmill and Bobby Davison. At the time Derby were going through serious financial problems and were bottom of the table, but he steered them to a mid-table position {{by the end of the}} season with a 15-match unbeaten run. In the Third Round of the FA Cup on 8 January 1983 they knocked out Clough's Forest <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 win at the Baseball Ground. They reached the Fifth Round, where they were knocked out by Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998. Favre had rallied the <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27–23. However, Steve Young responded with a touchdown of his own to wide receiver Terrell Owens with three seconds remaining to end the Packers season.

At {{the end of}} the group stage, the teams who {{finished}} bottom of their group were eliminated, along with the two teams above them (in Group A), and the team above them (in Group B), whereas the teams positioned in the top two slots in the groups progressed to the knock-out rounds. Due to there being an odd number of teams, Group A contained more matches and an additional <b>team,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total of 5 to Group B's 4 teams.|$|E
5|$|The pre-game buildup was {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} rematch. A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over Iowa State, but most predicted the game to be very close. Tulsa was considered a strong running <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solid defense, while Iowa State was balanced offensively and struggled at times on defense. This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E
