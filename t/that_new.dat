5|$|By 1902 PLC {{was running}} out of space again and Marden urged <b>that</b> <b>new</b> {{classrooms}} be built.

5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded <b>that</b> <b>new</b> fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E

5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill.
