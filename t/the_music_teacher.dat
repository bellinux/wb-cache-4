5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|In 1809, {{the school}} opened with 30 {{students}} and {{quickly became a}} family project. In the beginning, Jacob and Rebecca taught all the classes.

25|$|Another operatic feud {{began with}} the arrival of the German {{composer}} Christoph Willibald Gluck in Paris in 1776. He had already written a series of successful Italian operas. In Vienna, he had studied French and had been <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> of the young Marie Antoinette. In 1774, he staged the opera Iphigénie en Aulide in Paris, which became a huge popular triumph; he followed it with a French version of Orfeo ed Euridice, which he had written in Vienna in 1762, and then Alceste, reviving the classical lyrical tragedy style. The supporters of Italian opera responded by bringing the Italian opera composer Niccolo Piccinni to Paris in 1776. The rival new operas written by Gluck and Piccinni did not please the fickle Parisian audiences, and both composers left Paris in disgust. By the time of the Revolution the repertoire of the Paris opera consisted of five operas by Gluck, and those of Piccinni, Antonio Salieri, Sacchini and Gretry. Rameau and the French classical style had almost disappeared from the repertoire.|$|E

2500|$|When Shakira was four, {{her father}} {{took her to}} a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the doumbek, a {{traditional}} drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing. She started dancing on the table, and the experience made her realize that {{she wanted to be a}} performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in second grade, she was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> told her that she sounded [...] "like a goat". At school, she was often sent out of the class because of her hyperactivity (ADHD). She says she had also been known as [...] "the belly dancer girl", as she would demonstrate every Friday at school a number she had learned. [...] "That's how I discovered my passion for live performance," [...] she says.|$|E
2500|$|Cherubino then arrives and, after {{describing}} his emerging infatuation with all women, particularly with his [...] "beautiful godmother" [...] the Countess (aria: [...] – [...] "I don't know anymore what I am"), asks for Susanna's aid with the Count. It seems the Count is angry with Cherubino's amorous ways, having discovered {{him with the}} gardener's daughter, Barbarina, and plans to punish him. Cherubino wants Susanna to ask the Countess to intercede on his behalf. When the Count appears, Cherubino hides behind a chair, {{not wanting to be}} seen alone with Susanna. The Count uses the opportunity of finding Susanna alone to step up his demands for favours from her, including financial inducements to sell herself to him. As Basilio, <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher,</b> arrives, the Count, not wanting to be caught alone with Susanna, hides behind the chair. Cherubino leaves that hiding place just in time, and jumps onto the chair while Susanna scrambles to cover him with a dress.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, {{war broke}} out in Europe and on 3 September 1939, war was {{declared}} between England and Germany. Defence Regulation 18b was issued, ordering the internment of anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Nazis. The Home Office then ruled that anyone born in Germany was classified as an enemy alien and all German males over age 16 were interned. In addition to the pupils who were interned, some of the pupils who had gone home that summer to visit their families in Nazi areas never returned and were not heard from again. With two hours' notice to pack their things, the school lost five men and 10 of the older boys, then, the cook and female students aged 16, before {{it was determined that}} [...] "good Germans" [...] who had fled the Nazis could be released, provided they remain in one place {{until the end of the}} war. This benefited the school greatly. Maths was taught by an astronomer, <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> had been an assistant to Ludwig Karl Koch, the stoker, formerly a senior producer at Berlin's Deutsches Theater, directed school plays.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had {{assisted}} on The Likes of Us and who was <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> at the Colet Court school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir. Doggett requested a [...] "pop cantata" [...] {{along the lines of}} Herbert Chappell's The Daniel Jazz (1963) and Michael Hurd's Jonah-Man Jazz (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 {{on the back of the}} success of Jesus Christ Superstar.|$|E

6000|$|It was Sunday {{afternoon}} in Miss Patricia Doyle's pretty flat at 3708 Willing Square. In the small drawing room Patricia--or Patsy, as {{she preferred to}} be called--was seated at the piano softly playing the one [...] "piece" [...] <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher</b> had succeeded in drilling into her flighty head by virtue of much patience and perseverance. In a thick cushioned morris-chair reclined the motionless form of Uncle John, a chubby little man in a gray suit, whose features were temporarily eclipsed by the newspaper that was spread carefully over them. Occasionally a gasp or a snore from beneath the paper suggested that the little man was [...] "snoozing" [...] as he sometimes gravely called it, instead of listening to the music.|$|E
60|$|There were no Mayflowers in June; {{but now the}} Old Lady's {{garden was}} full of {{blossoms}} and every morning Sylvia found a bouquet of them by the beech--the perfumed ivory of white narcissus, the flame of tulips, the fairy branches of bleeding-heart, the pink-and-snow of little, thorny, single, sweetbreathed early roses. The Old Lady had no fear of discovery, for the flowers that grew in her garden grew in every other Spencervale garden as well, including the Stewart garden. Chris Stewart, when he was teased about <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>teacher,</b> merely smiled and held his peace. Chris knew perfectly well who was the real giver of those flowers. He had made it his business {{to find out when}} the Mayflower gossip started. But since it was evident Old Lady Lloyd did not wish it to be known, Chris told no one. Chris had always liked Old Lady Lloyd ever since the day, ten years before, when she had found him crying in the woods with a cut foot and had taken him into her house, and bathed and bound the wound, and given him ten cents to buy candy at the store. The Old Lady went without supper that night because of it, but Chris never knew that.|$|E
