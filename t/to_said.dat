5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people <b>to</b> <b>said</b> person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|Edward Wadie Said {{was born}} on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and Wadie Said, a {{businessman}} in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed Mandatory Palestine (1920–48). Wadie Said was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned American citizenship <b>to</b> <b>Said</b> père and his family. Edward’s mother, Hilda Said was born Lebanese and raised in Nazareth, Palestine.|$|E

Especially troublesome <b>to</b> <b>Said</b> was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E

The fighters at Herdla were {{dispatched}} and intercepted the bombers over Sotra. They avoided engagement over Bergen to avoid interfering with the air defenses. This was repeated on 29 October with 244 bombers. From December Bf109s returned to Herdla. The number of skirmishes between British and German forces along the West Coast increased in this period, and the Luftwaffe concentrated its aircraft matériel in Norway <b>to</b> <b>said</b> area.

25|$|Termite colonies are {{examples}} of eusocial insects. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist {{each other in the}} rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual’s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. Hamilton’s rule is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness <b>to</b> <b>said</b> individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic.|$|E
25|$|Oblate {{spheroid}} waveguide (OSWG) horn designs improve directivity pattern control, {{provide a}} lower frequency of directivity (the lower {{the better to}} match woofers and mid-woofers' directivity), and--as claimed by the inventor -- Dr.Earl Geddes they mitigate higher order modes (HOM), a form of linear phase/amplitude-distortion. A major contribution <b>to</b> <b>said</b> comb-filter effects, namely the practically limited hornlength is explicitly not addressed by the theory of OSWG. Realized specimen attempt constant directivity and a smooth transition between the compression driver and the horn. OSWG designs are applied to the higher frequency range, above about 1kHz.|$|E
