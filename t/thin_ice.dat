5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through <b>thin</b> <b>ice.</b> The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on <b>thin</b> <b>ice.</b> When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E

40|$|The Arctic is {{undergoing}} big changes, {{there has been}} a reduction in sea ice extent and an increase in the amount of <b>thinner,</b> newer <b>ice.</b> This changing surface causes challenges to numerical weather prediction and climate simulation, due to the very interconnected nature of the surface and atmosphere in the Arctic. Changes to the surface may impact on the air temperature, the surface fluxes of heat and moisture and the microphysics of clouds amongst others. These areas could also, in turn, change the surface. The Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) is the area of the sea ice which is between the open water and solid ice, and is characterised by a complex and constantly changing ice surface. The impact of <b>thinning</b> <b>ice</b> in the MIZ was investigated using a series of idealised modelling experiments, and it was found that <b>thinner</b> sea <b>ice</b> in the MIZ would increase the surface temperature and fluxes of heat. In turn this causes the clouds, which formover the open water, to formcloser to the ice edge. The clouds were found to be thinner for the experiments with <b>thinner</b> <b>ice,</b> which resulted in them allowing more shortwave radiation to reach the surface. This result implies that <b>thinning</b> sea <b>ice</b> would act to further <b>thin</b> sea <b>ice.</b> Using observations from the Aerosol- Clouds Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic (ACCACIA) campaign, two sets of model sensitivity studies were undertaken to test which boundary layer parametrisation schemes would performbetter. It was discovered that the boundary layer in the model is more sensitive to the surface representation rather than the choice of boundary layer scheme. These results point to the need for more work, both observations and modelling, on the sea ice {{and its impact on the}} atmosphere in order to better predict the changes the Arctic and the planet will undergo with a changing climate. ...|$|R

50|$|In 2006-07, a {{team led}} by Son Nghiem of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, studied trends in Arctic {{perennial}} ice cover by combining data from NASA's QuikSCAT satellite, which can identify and map different classes of sea ice, including older, thicker perennial <b>ice</b> and younger, <b>thinner</b> seasonal <b>ice.</b> The scientists observed that the Arctic Ocean was dominated by <b>thinner</b> seasonal <b>ice</b> that melts faster. This ice is more easily compressed and responds more quickly to being pushed out of the Arctic by winds. Those <b>thinner</b> seasonal <b>ice</b> conditions facilitated the ice loss, leading to this 2007’s record low amount of total Arctic sea ice. Nghiem concluded that the rapid decline in winter perennial ice the past two years was caused by unusual wind patterns that compressed the sea ice, loaded it into the Transpolar Drift Stream and then sped its flow out of the Arctic, where it rapidly melted in the warmer waters at lower latitudes.|$|R
40|$|Air {{temperature}} and winter precipitation changes {{over the last}} five decades have impacted the timing, duration, and thickness of the ice cover on Arctic lakes as shown by recent studies. In the case of shallow tundra lakes, many of which are less than 3 m deep, warmer climate conditions could result in <b>thinner</b> <b>ice</b> covers and consequently, in a smaller fraction of lakes freezing to their bed in winter. However, these changes have not yet been comprehensively documented. The analysis of a 20 yr time series of European remote sensing satellite ERS- 1 / 2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a numerical lake ice model were employed to determine the response of ice cover (thickness, freezing to the bed, and phenology) on shallow lakes of the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) to climate conditions over the last six decades. Given the large area covered by these lakes, changes in the regional climate and weather are related to regime shifts in the ice cover of the lakes. Analysis of available SAR data from 1991 to 2011, from a sub-region of the NSA near Barrow, shows a reduction in the fraction of lakes that freeze to the bed in late winter. This finding is in good agreement with the decrease in ice thickness simulated with the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo), a lower fraction of lakes frozen to the bed corresponding to a <b>thinner</b> <b>ice</b> cover. Observed changes of the ice cover show a trend toward increasing floating ice fractions from 1991 to 2011, with the greatest change occurring in April, when the grounded ice fraction declined by 22 % (α = 0. 01). Model results indicate a trend toward <b>thinner</b> <b>ice</b> covers by 18 – 22 cm (no-snow and 53 % snow depth scenarios, α = 0. 01) during the 1991 – 2011 period and by 21 – 38 cm (α = 0. 001) from 1950 to 2011. The longer trend analysis (1950 – 2011) also shows a decrease in the ice cover duration by ~ 24 days consequent to later freeze-up dates by 5. 9 days (α = 0. 1) and earlier break-up dates by 17. 7 – 18. 6 days (α = 0. 001) ...|$|R

25|$|The thermal {{properties}} of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. Thermal diffusivity {{is a measure}} of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through <b>thin</b> <b>ice</b> continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the hydrological cycle. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.|$|E

40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{investigating}} the effects of sea ice changes on the climate sensitivity to doubled atmospheric CO 2, the authors use a standard simple sea ice model while varying the sea ice distributions and thicknesses in the control run. <b>Thinner</b> <b>ice</b> amplifies the atmospheric temperature senstivity in these experiments by about 15 % (to a warming of 4. 8 C), because it is easier for the <b>thinner</b> <b>ice</b> to be removed as the climate warms. Thus, its impact on sensitivity {{is similar to that of}} greater sea ice extent in the control run, which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction. An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO 2 simulations illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature changes, including cloud cover and water vapor feedbacks that arise in response to sea ice variations, amounts to 37 % of the temperature sensitivity to the CO 2 doubling, accounting for 1. 56 C of the 4. 17 C global warming. This is about four times larger than the sea ice impact when no feedbacks are allowed. The different experiments produce a range of results for southern high latitudes with the hydrologic budget over Antarctica implying sea level increases of varying magnitude or no change. These results highlight the importance of properly constraining the sea ice response to climate perturbations, necessitating the use of more realistic sea ice and ocean models...|$|R
