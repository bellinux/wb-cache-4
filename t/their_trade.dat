5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} trading {{strategies}} of corporate insiders along three dimensions: (1) when they break up <b>their</b> <b>trades</b> into sequences of multiple transactions, (2) {{how long they}} take to complete <b>their</b> <b>trades,</b> and (3) if they adapt <b>their</b> <b>trading</b> decisions to the liquidity of the market. The literature develops two complementary theories of optimal trading strategies: Information-based arguments predict that insiders trade faster if they compete with other insiders for exploiting the same information. By contrast, liquidity-based arguments pre-dict the opposite. Liquidity-based arguments have more explanatory power and we find strong evidence that insiders adapt <b>their</b> <b>trading</b> strategies to market liquidity. However, based on disclosure-day returns we classify about one in seven trades as information-based and these trades do complete faster than liquidity-based trades {{in the presence of}} competi-tion from other insiders, in line with information-based arguments...|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group until the middle of the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using deep-lying midfielders, as he noted that most of the Ireland international players plied <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> in England. Crucially he instructed all members of his team to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E

During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, but the number of visitors and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E

Following the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur).|$|E

5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements.

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{insiders}} and firms trade when arbitrage is limited. When arbitrage is costly (proxied by high idiosyncratic risk), insiders and firms earn higher absolute returns on <b>their</b> <b>trades</b> (insider trading, share repurchases, and seasoned equity offerings) {{in the following}} year. Furthermore, they initiate <b>their</b> <b>trades</b> following greater past price movements in the preceding year. These results are not driven by information asymmetry or firm size. Overall, our {{results are consistent with}} the idea that insiders and firms compete with outside arbitrageurs in exploiting mispricings and benefit when outside arbitrage is limited...|$|R
