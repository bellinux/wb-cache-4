500|$|In an {{interview}} with music webzine Pitchfork, Robyn was asked if [...] "Fembot" [...] represented a dislike for the notion that humans and robots are separate, and she responded by saying, [...] "The classic, dystopian theory about the future is not really as interesting <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> book I, Robot is all about these robots that basically went nuts, and it's always because they were wrongly programmed by humans. It's like a mirror of our own psyche. It's almost like the wrong program could be a mental disease." [...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time. [...] "Technology is becoming more organic, and using the word 'fembot' or 'robot' in a song makes things more human to me", she said. In {{an interview}} with music website Stereogum, she explained that the song also chronicles her personal experience of [...] "turning 30 and contemplating children". She elaborated, saying, ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, and it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

2500|$|For example, in a {{surviving}} recorded radio {{interview from}} June 25, Arnold described them as looking [...] "something like a pie plate that {{was cut in}} half {{with a sort of}} a convex triangle in the rear." [...] His motion descriptions were: [...] "I noticed to the left of me a chain which looked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, it sounds <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are among}} them {{a few things that}} are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe that the people are right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of 1812, Miller raised a company of local men and traveled to Burlington, Vermont. He transferred to the 30th Infantry Regiment in the regular army of the United States with the rank of lieutenant. Miller spent most of the war working as a recruiter and on February 1, 1814, he was promoted to captain. He saw his first action at the Battle of Plattsburgh, where vastly outnumbered American forces overcame the British. [...] "The fort I was in was exposed to every shot. Bombs, rockets, and shrapnel shells fell as thick as hailstones", he said. One of these many shots had exploded two feet from him, wounding three of his men and killing another, but Miller survived without a scratch. Miller came to view the outcome of this battle as miraculous, and therefore at odds with his deistic view of a distant God far removed from human affairs. He later wrote, [...] "It seemed to me that the Supreme Being must have watched over the interests of this country in an especial manner, and delivered us from the hands of our enemies... So surprising a result, against such odds, did seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of a mightier power than man." ...|$|E

60|$|I sat {{looking at}} Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this supposititious case: whether, {{if she were}} {{employed}} <b>to</b> lose <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> boy in the fairy tale, I {{should be able to}} track my way home again by the buttons she would shed.|$|R
6000|$|... "The people I speak of," [...] the {{magistrate}} said, [...] "have vast temples constructed of huge stones placed in circles, which appear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> great pyramids of Egypt, an astronomical signification, for I {{found that the}} stones round the sacrificial altars were so placed that the sun at its rising threw its rays upon the stone only upon the longest day of summer." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything.

6000|$|... "Well, it doesn't quite {{strike me}} in that light, Pina. My {{imagination}} isn't so lively as yours.

60|$|I rather {{avoided the}} old chest after this. It {{took on a}} new {{significance}} in my eyes and seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tomb of something--possibly some dead and buried romance of the past.|$|E
60|$|We {{sat down}} in the candle-lit {{twilight}} to supper. It was <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> supper of a child, taken at peace in the clear beams, ere he descend into the shadow of sleep.|$|E

6000|$|... "Better go slow," [...] urged {{one of his}} friends. [...] "That chap looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> one of <b>the</b> old guard. He {{may have}} {{something}} to say about your doings with his daughter." ...|$|R
500|$|... "To me [...] a singer/songwriter. But his album {{itself is}} incredible. He’s super talented. <b>To</b> <b>me</b> he’s <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Black James Taylor. He’s lyrical—he’s {{got a great}} {{perspective}} and super sick melodies. I haven’t seen anybody bob and weave through chords with such catchy melodies in a long time—that’s why I liked working with him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno {{where they}} went--Abe didn't say an' it wasn't my {{business}} to question 'em," [...] returned Dick Logan. [...] "Looked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> elderly gent {{was some kind}} o' a school sharp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{it still}} seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> crying of a woman, And it saddens me much that so piteous a sound On this my bridal night when I would get agone from sorrow [...] Should so ghost-like wander round!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{singular}} spectacle," [...] said Maxwell.

6000|$|He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, [...] "I'd {{like to go}} {{in there}} and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk down <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I was <b>the</b> butler! I'd <b>like</b> to--" ...|$|R
