40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new equipment}} for the compression testing of materials under high rates of loading. The equipment consists of an electromagnetic actuator, a fixed housing containing two flat compression platens, a <b>translating</b> <b>cam</b> and a follower. The electromagnetic actuator makes possible reaching high strain rates with a very precise control of the impact velocity and of the energy transmitted to the <b>translating</b> <b>cam.</b> The cam profile enables compression testing to be performed under the strain-rate vs. strain loading paths that are commonly found in manufacturing {{in order to meet}} the machine-tool and process combined specifications. The equipment was designed, fabricated and instrumented by the authors and, besides giving constructive details for those readers that may be interested in developing a low-cost equipment for compression testing at high rates of loading, the paper also puts emphasis on the flexibility and adequacy of its operative conditions for determining the mechanical behaviour of Aluminium AA 1050 -O under different testing conditions...|$|E

40|$|A {{hydraulically}} actuated {{device is}} described for applying a test load to a bearing {{or the like}} to prove the integrity of its mounting or staking within a bore in a housing such as gear case. To accommodate limited access situations, the device is constructed in a right angle configuration in which a hydraulic cylinder applies axial pressure to a first thrust rod assemly which includes a first thrust rod through a threated spindle driving a linearly <b>translated</b> <b>cam.</b> Cam follower wheel transfers the translation to a second thrust rod assembly which includes a horizontal shaft and a spindle within a cross-arm housing portion and a tubular housing portion. The same second thrust direction applies the bearing loading in either of two directions depending upon {{the shape of the}} interface parts. The interface parts can bear on the bearing from either side with respect to the bearing mounting structural part...|$|R

[...] Even Michaelis, the great archaeologist, who denounces 'The Curse of Minerva' as a [...] "'libellous' poem," [...] and affirms [...] "that only blind passion could doubt that Lord Elgin's act was an act of preservation," [...] admits that [...] "the removal of several metopes and of the statue from the Erechtheion had severely injured the surrounding architecture" [...] ('Ancient Marbles in Great Britain', by A. Michaelis, <b>translated</b> by <b>C.A.M.</b> Fennell, 1882, p. 135).

This paper used Pro/E's datum-graph function, to create the follower's displacement line graph, and to control cam profile by using the displacement line graph, the line <b>translating</b> tip follower <b>cam</b> mechanism was wholly parametric designed. The system can provide 16 kinds of typical combination motion law for users. The system can generate automatically cam profile according to the parameter imported by the consumer.

40|$|The cam {{fatigue life}} of the {{translating}} roller [...] -follower and translating flat [...] -faced follower system has been investigated for polynomial and cycloidal displacement functions. Ioannides and Harris (IH) life prediction model are used to estimate the cam fatigue life. Computer program codes are written to calculate and simulate {{the different types of}} loads that act on the cam, the contact stresses in the cam and the followers and the 2 ̆ 7 volume under risk 2 ̆ 7. Ioannides [...] -Harris theory is applied to the 2 ̆ 7 volume under risk 2 ̆ 7 and expected fatigue life is calculated. The effects of cam base circle radius, cam angular velocity, roller [...] -follower radius of curvature, cam thickness, follower eccentricity (offset), total lift (rise or fall), and second dwell angle on the fatigue life are studied for the translating roller [...] -follower and flat [...] -faced follower. In the <b>cam</b> <b>translating</b> roller [...] -follower systems, it is found that the main design parameter governing the cam fatigue life is the cam base circle radius. In this system, the fatigue life curve shows an improvement in the fatigue life up to a critical cam base circle radius value. Any further increase in the cam base circle radius appears as a decrease in the fatigue life. While in the <b>cam</b> <b>translating</b> flat [...] -faced follower systems, the fatigue life curve shows an improvement in the fatigue life up to a cam base circle radius value where the fatigue life was infinite. Also it is found that the cam radius of curvature plays the major rule in controlling the cam fatigue life in the flat [...] -face follower systems...|$|R
40|$|When {{creating}} shapes {{by using}} a 3 D printer, usually, a static (declarative) model designed {{by using a}} 3 D CAD system is <b>translated</b> to a <b>CAM</b> program and it {{is sent to the}} printer. However, widely-used FDM-type 3 D printers input a dynamical (procedural) program that describes control of motions of the print head and extrusion of the filament. If the program is expressed by using a programming language or a library in a straight manner, solids can be created by a method similar to turtle graphics. An open-source library that enables “turtle 3 D printing” method was described by Python and tested. Although this method currently has a problem that it cannot print in the air; however, if this problem is solved by an appropriate method, shapes drawn by 3 D turtle graphics freely can be embodied by this method...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The use {{of digital}} {{fabrication}} {{in the production}} and making of architecture is becoming a prevalent vehicle for the design process. As a result, {{there is a growing}} demand for computer-aided design (CAD) skills, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) logic, parametric modelling and digital fabrication in student education. This paper will highlight a case study project that sought to ingrate computational prototyping with digital fabrication techniques in the production of architecture. The goal is to use virtual and physical prototyping to educate students in CAD, CAM, parametric modelling and digital fabrication. Rather than repeating conventional approaches or recreating from precedent, iterative prototyping challenges students to understand the CAD technique or parameters for modelling and <b>translate</b> intentions for <b>CAM</b> production. Students engage real world constraints of materials, time and tectonics. In the end, these projects are critical of the digital and speculate on the architectural detail in an age of digital ubiquity...|$|R
40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) signals {{regulate}} {{a diverse}} set of cellular responses, from proliferation to muscular contraction and neuro-endocrine secretion. The ubiquitous Ca 2 + sensor, calmodulin (<b>CaM),</b> <b>translates</b> changes in local intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations into changes in enzyme activities. Among its targets, the Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent protein kinases I and IV (CaMKs) {{are capable of}} transducing intraneuronal signals, and these kinases are implicated in neuronal gene regulation that mediates synaptic plasticity in mammals. Recently, the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) has been proposed as a target for a CaMK cascade involving not only CaMKI or CaMKIV, but also an upstream kinase kinase that is also CaM regulated (CaMKK). Here, we report that all components of this pathway are coexpressed in head neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Utilizing a transgenic approach to visualize CREB-dependent transcription in vivo, we show that this CaMK cascade regulates CRE-mediated transcription in a subset of head neurons in living nematodes...|$|R

The <b>cam</b> rim with cover diameter of 2. 4 mm {{is driven by}} four electrostatic comb-drive actuators (ECA). Reciprocating motion of the ECAs is converted to unidirectional rotating movement of the outer cam rim through ratchet and anti-reverse mechanisms. The MCS was fabricated by using SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer with 30 孠thick device layer, and only one mask.

This project is sponsored by Endologix, Inc. to provide test data characterizing mechanical material properties of various formulations of polymer used in abdominal aortic aneurysm surgeries. With this project goal, the machine {{must be able to}} test the polymer at body conditions; these include a testing temperature of 37 °C and a cycling frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 10 Hz. This report proposes the following solution to this design challenge: an AC motor-driven mechanism utilizing a planetary gearbox and pulley system to reduce the speed of the motor to those necessary to achieve testing frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 5 Hz, 8 Hz, and 10 Hz. From the drive mechanism, a shaft-mounted <b>cam</b> <b>translates</b> the rotational motion to linear motion through a cam follower. This cam follower carries a load cell and test specimen grip fixtures which clamp onto the specimen to apply cyclic loading. To vary the percent elongation applied to the test specimen, the cam has been designed to be interchangeable to accomplish a range of elongations: 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 %...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} is {{a highly}} prevalent degenerative joint disorder characterized by joint tissue damage and pain. Knee joint distraction has been introduced as a joint preserving surgical procedure to postpone knee arthroplasty. An often used standard externally fixation device for distraction poses a burden to patients due {{to the absence of}} joint flexion during the 6 weeks treatment. Therefore, a personalized articulating distraction device was developed. The aim {{of this study was to}} test technical feasibility of this device. METHODS: Based on an often applied rigid device, using equal bone pin positions and connectors, a hinge mechanism was developed consisting of a cam-following system for reproducing the complex joint-specific knee kinematics. In support, a device was developed for capturing the joint-specific sagittal plane articulation. The obtained kinematic data were <b>translated</b> into joint-specific <b>cam</b> shapes that were installed bilaterally in the hinge mechanism of the distraction device, as such providing personalized knee motion. Distraction of 5 mm was performed within a range of motion of 30 deg. joint flexion. Pre-clinical evaluation of the working principle was performed on human cadaveric legs and system stiffness characteristics were biomechanically evaluated. FINDINGS: The desired range of motion was obtained and distraction was maintained under physiologically representative loading. Moreover, the joint-specific approach demonstrated tolerance of deviations from anatomical and alignment origin during initial placement of the developed distraction device. INTERPRETATION: Articulation during knee distraction is considered technically feasible and has potential to decrease burden and improve acceptance of distraction therapy. Testing of clinical feasibility is warranted...|$|R
