Some, for instance Kai Nielsen, endorse world government; others, such as Simon Caney, do not. The extent to which cosmopolitans advocate global redistribution of resources also varies. All cosmopolitans, however, believe that individuals, and not states, nations, or other groups, are the ultimate focus of universal moral standards.|$|E

25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E

[...] The season commenced with both parts of [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] on October3,2008. The following episodes aired almost every Friday during the 10 to 11pm time slot from October10,2008, until January9,2009. In Canada, it aired on Movie Channel One of The Movie Network. In the United Kingdom, the season was picked up for broadcast by ITV4. The first episode was broadcast on October6,2008, only {{three days after the}} release on the Sci Fi Channel.

500|$|An {{reviewer}} from MTV {{said that}} [...] "Latin pop innovator Shakira represents {{the kind of}} eventuality for which Alanis Morissette, Bob Dylan and Beck are all precedents", however also noted that [...] "Those expecting polite recreations of Latin styles past will be sorely disappointed, but listeners for whom crossover is the norm will find a wealth of satisfaction in Donde Estan los Ladrones, whether or not <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> words". Leila Cobo Hanlon from Miami Herald was positive, saying that the album [...] "retains Shakira's trademark sound — rock-laced pop melodies backed by acoustic guitars — {{as well as her}} deeply personal approach to music-making", but also noting that [...] "ironically, the album's only failures occur when it looks too closely at its predecessor". Sputnikmusic website gave a positive review saying [...] "¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? is the gem of Shakira's discography, {{and one of the best}} Spanish pop releases of the past decade", although criticized its [...] "slight lack of variety". Franz Reynold from Latin Beat Magazine noted that [...] "while many of the cuts on this collection are definitely chart-bound, that is due more to the fact that she doesn't stray too far from the previous formula, than it does to any hope that success provides room for expansion", but complimented tracks like [...] "Inevitable" [...] and [...] "Tú". Rubens Herbst from Brazilian newspaper [...] gave a mixed review, writing that the album was [...] "homogenous, well-produced and full of potential hits", but [...] "empty and forgettable, like every FM pop — and the fact of singing in Spanish doesn't take Shakira away from the label". In July 2017, the album ranked at number 95 on the list for the 150 greatest female albums of all time by the National Public Radio.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the United States, the One-China Policy was first stated in the Shanghai Communiqué of 1972: [...] "the United States {{acknowledges}} that Chinese {{on either side of the}} Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. [...] The United States does not challenge that position." [...] The United States has not expressed an explicitly immutable statement regarding whether it believes Taiwan is independent or not. [...] Instead, Washington simply states that <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> PRC's claims on Taiwan as its own. [...] In fact, many scholars agree that U.S. One-China Policy was not intended to please the PRC government, but as a way for Washington to conduct international relations in the region, which Beijing fails to state.|$|E

The attack was widely condemned in Israel. Khdeir's family members have, however, blamed government incitement for the murder and rejected the PM's condolence message, {{as well as a}} visit by then President Shimon Peres. The day the suspects were arrested, the family of one of the Israeli victims, the Fraenkels, called the family of Abu Khdeir to condemn the murder and offer their condolences. The Fraenkels said <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the loss and that they oppose any act of violence either by Jews or Arabs. The murder was condemned by the families of the three murdered Israeli teens, who sent Khdeir's family their condolences.|$|E
2500|$|After the conference-specific tryouts, the {{managers}} begin the draft. Like most major sports leagues, the order is assembled {{by the previous}} season's standings in reverse.

The late-round draft picks [...] those that occupy roster spots 24 and beyond [...] are notified of their conditional team affiliation. Their registration fee is discounted, while their contact information is kept for emergency roster situations; roster vacancies via injuries, vacations, or those who must return to school in early August.

2500|$|Traditional {{mathematics}} {{focuses on}} teaching algorithms {{that will lead}} to the correct answer. [...] Because of this focus on application of algorithms, the traditional math student must always use the specific method that is being taught. [...] This kind of algorithmic dependence is de-emphasized in reform mathematics. [...] Reformers do not oppose correct answers, but prefer to focus students' attention on the process leading to the answer, rather than the answer itself. [...] The presence of occasional errors is deemed less important than the overall thought process. Research has shown that children make fewer mistakes with calculations and remember algorithms longer when <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concepts underlying the methods they use. In general, children in reform classes perform at least as well as children in traditional classes on tests of calculation skill, and considerably better on tests of problem solving.|$|E
