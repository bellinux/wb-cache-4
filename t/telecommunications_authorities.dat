40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{telecommunications}} needs {{of developing countries}} {{and the possibility of}} using satellite communications to meet those needs. Three primary technological factors provide a guide to this application: small inexpensive satellite earth stations can provide {{a solution to the problem}} of limited ground facilities; satellites can operate in a broadcast and multiple acess mode as well as in a conventional point- to-point mode; and, the capacity required to support a single interactive digital terminal is about 1000 times less than that required to support a voice telephone and abput 1 000 000 times less than that required for video transmission. These factors lead to consideration of new forms of national networks based on satellites, microprocessors and small earth stations which do not follow the North American model. These new advanced forms of networks can co-exist with conventional voice networks, and can provide a realistic alternative for consideration by national <b>telecommunications</b> <b>authorities.</b> Telecommunications Satellites National networks...|$|E

This paper deals with the new model of management structure of the Croatian Posts and Telecommunications (HPT), made upon the one-time abandoned pattern of organization as originally based upon the principles of self-management decentralization. Consequently, a new far more efficient and viewed socially far more rational organization system of posts and telecommunications has been required. The exposed organization model has been designed as a unique system with two sub-systems: Postal Authorities and <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Authorities</b> linked with joint functions (services). On this basis, consequently, the organization of individual levels of postal and telecommunications network and individual geographic regions have been structured. Each organization i. e. management level has been structured according to the contents and scope of its assignments and {{the area of the}} region it covers. By way of interaction of organization (management) units, the organizational unity of the system has been achieved. This way the regular maintenance of the postal and telecommunications network is secured as well as the regular and standardized quality of domestic and international postal and telecommunications traffic. </p...|$|E

40|$|Although {{telecommunications}} {{has long}} been recognized as an essential catalyst for growth, investments in telecommunications infrastructure {{has not been a}} central focus for most developing countries. This is primarily because until recently, <b>telecommunications</b> <b>authorities</b> were government owned agencies and were subject to standard government budget practices which meant that they had compete for budget allocation from the state along with other bureaucracies. As funds were not allocated exclusively according to economic criteria, the telecommunications industry generally experienced a gap in investments as the gains associated with telecommunications investments were underestimated or simply unknown. The reform of the public sector in most developing countries in recent years has facilitated an upsurge in investment in the telecommunications industry. This has brought about questions as {{to the role of the}} private sector in economic development and also in particular what effects telecoms investments can potentially have on economic growth. This study looked into these issues in the context of the Nigerian telecommunications industry and the conclusion reached from a review of the literature and the study findings reveal that: A positive relationship exists between economic development and infrastructure investments in general and telecommunications in particular. Sustained Investments in telecommunications on its own are not enough to ensure economic growth, but a lack of adequate telecommunications infrastructure and investment can significantly constrain economic development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2009. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). A band plan is a plan for utilizing a particular band of radio frequencies that are {{a portion of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. Each band plan defines the frequency range to be included, how channels are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels. An Amateur Radio Band Plan is an arrangement of how to use radio frequencies. Amateur radio frequency allocation is done by national <b>telecommunications</b> <b>authorities,</b> in our case, it should have been done by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. Globally, the ITU oversees how much radio spectrum is set aside for amateur radio transmissions. In 2001 the National Frequency Allocation Plan was made and adopted in 2004 by BTRC. The commission allocated HF and VHF, UHF frequency range for HAM, but merely specified any details. Radio amateurs use a variety of transmission modes, including Morse code, radioteletype, data, and voice. Specific frequency allocations are a matter of record and vary from country to country and between ITU regions as specified in the current ITU HF frequency allocations for amateur radio. In our thesis we are aiming {{to come up with the}} band plan for amateur radio in Bangladesh. The proposal contains the distribution of amateur frequency to set the first such footing towards an effective utilization of the allocated frequencies. The proposed band plan is in accordance with the National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) of Bangladesh, compatible with International Amateur Radio Union Region 3 (IARU R 3) countries and it is done after taking consideration of our technology and resource.

40|$|Purpose of the study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to offer an {{overview}} on spectrum management methods and to provide a detailed analysis of one of them, namely the Administrative Incentive Pricing (AIP). This thesis discusses the background, purpose and determination of AIP by first shortly introducing the alternatives for AIP and then critically assessing the alternative ways to construct such payments. The main economic models discussed include the opportunity cost based theory by Smith and NERA (1996) as well the subsequent, more refined model by Levine and Rickman (2007), which extends the Smith-NERA methodology to account for market structure and interference constraints. These models and the alternative ways of assigning frequencies are critically viewed against their core assumptions, regulator's objectives for spectrum management as well as from the point of view of economic efficiency. Methodology: The study is conducted as a literature review combining literature and publications from scientific research regarding spectrum management and formation of AIP payments, consultative research commissioned by the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>authorities</b> as well as publicly available information on realized market transactions for spectrum. Results of the study: Taking into account the growing demand and utilization of spectrum resources and given its scarcity, spectrum management and efficiency of use is crucial. Traditional administrative allocation and assignment methods need to be replaced by market based methods or complemented by market mimicking methods such as the AIP in order to fulfill efficiency. AIP payments are currently constructed through three different kinds of methods basing the payment either on the concept of opportunity cost, realized market prices or treating the formation as an optimization problem where the regulator maximizes overall welfare with respect to the spectrum fee given the interference and resource constraints. The latter method (by Levine and Rickman) combines economic modelling and information theory arriving at a group of equations determining optimal AIP. The key conclusion is that in a setting where interference, market structure and overall welfare including consumer and producer surplus as well as the revenue impact for the government from imposing AIP are accounted for, the optimal AIP should be higher whenever spectrum sharing is possible. The AIP then act as Ramsey tax across sectors of the economy being inversely related to the elasticity of demand. The method by Levine and Rickman explicitly accounts for most of the crucial elements of spectrum and spectrum markets, but further studies are needed especially to account for dynamic efficiency and how AIP payments may be used to promote it...|$|E
