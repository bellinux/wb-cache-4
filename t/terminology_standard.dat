40|$|Abstract Background SNOMED CT {{is being}} {{increasingly}} adopted {{as the standard}} clinical terminology for health care applications. Existing clinical applications that use legacy interface terminology need to migrate to the preferred SNOMED CT standard. In this paper, we describe our experience and methodology for mapping concepts from a legacy system to SNOMED CT. Methods Our approach includes the establishment of mapping rules between terminologists and back and forth collaboration of the mapped results through one or more iterations {{in order to reach}} consensus on the final maps. Results We highlight our results {{not only in terms of}} the number of matches, quality of maps, use of post-coordination, and multiple maps but also include our observations about SNOMED CT including inconsistencies, redundancies and omissions related to our legacy mapping. Conclusion Our methodology and lessons learned from this mapping exercise may be helpful to other terminologists who may be similarly challenged to migrate their legacy terminology to SNOMED CT. This mapping process and resulting discoveries about SNOMED CT may further contribute to refinement of this dynamic, clinical <b>terminology</b> <b>standard.</b> </p...|$|E

Kockaert 1, 2 & Frieda Steurs 1, 2, 3 KU Leuven 1, University of the Free State 2, UCO 3 Abstract The NATO Terminology Office (NTO) advocates {{clear and}} {{unambiguous}} communication among its members and partners, following the NATO Policy for Standardization: "NATO documents must contain NATO agreed terminology. " It is the NATO Terminology Programme (NTP) that provides standardized terminology, stamped with the "NATO Agreed" status to all NATO terms. This paper investigates in which way the NTO could apply terminology standards issued by ISO TC 37 {{with a view to}} pursuing this advocacy. Intensional definitions (ISO 704), instrumental in developing (multilingual) concept systems, will be tested on a sample of terms and definitions in the NATO terminology database. It will be demonstrated that ISO 24156 - 1, a <b>terminology</b> <b>standard</b> on concept modelling, is useful in implementing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) in multilingual concept systems with a view to consolidating and mapping agreed terminology, hence to communicating clearly.

40|$|Purpose: Version 1. 0 of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) is a logic-based {{compositional}} terminology. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 18104 : 2003 Health Informatics¿Integration of {{a reference}} terminology model for nursing {{is an international}} standard to support the development, testing and implementation of nursing terminologies. Methods: This study examines how ISO 18104 : 2003 has been interpreted {{in the development of}} ICNP® Version 1. 0 by identifying mappings between ICNP® and the ISO standard. Representations of diagnostic and interventional statements within ICNP® are also analyzed according to the requirements mandated by the ISO standard. Results: All structural components of ISO 18104 : 2003 i. e. semantic categories, semantic domains, qualifiers and semantic links are represented either directly or in interpreted form within ICNP®. The formal representations within ICNP® of diagnostic and interventional statements meet the requirement of the ISO standard. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that ICNP® Version 1. 0 conforms to ISO 18104 : 2003. More importantly perhaps, this study provides practical examples of how components of a <b>terminology</b> <b>standard</b> might be interpreted and it examines how such a standard might be used to support the definition of high-level schemata in developing logic-based compositional terminologies...|$|E

40|$|Most {{physicists}} uphold {{that the}} {{tests of the}} Bell inequalities (BI) performed up to now confirm the predictions of standard quantum mechanics (SQM) and refute local realism. But some scholars criticize this conviction, defending local realism in various ways. We present here a new viewpoint based on an improved version of the extended semantic realism (ESR) model that has been recently worked out {{by one of the}} authors. The ESR model embodies the mathematical formalism of SQM into a more general framework in which not only local realism but also objectivity of physical properties holds, and the probabilities of SQM are reinterpreted as conditional instead of absolute. Hence the ESR model provides some predictions that are formally identical to those of SQM but have a different physical interpretation, and further predictions that differ also formally from those of SQM. In particular, we show here that the BI introduced by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (BCHSH inequalities) must be replaced by modified BCHSH inequalities. These depend on detection probabilities which may be such that the new inequalities are never violated by the conditional expectation values predicted by the model. The condition that no violation occurs implies the existence of upper bounds on detection probabilities, which makes the ESR model falsifiable. These results admit an intuitive explanation in terms of unfair sampling but basically differ from the seemingly similar results obtained by other approaches in which the efficiency problem is discussed in order to vindicate some kind of local realism.

Yet there is no standard method for investigators to query for studies that are relevant to their scientific hypothesis.
