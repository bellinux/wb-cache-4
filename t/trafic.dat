5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (<b>TRAFIC),</b> membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E

60|$|When {{navigation}} {{was so far}} improved {{that the}} Phœnicians began to leave the sea-shore, and sail through the Mediterranean by {{the help of the}} stars, it may be presumed that they began to discover the islands of the Mediterranean, {{and for the sake of}} <b>trafic</b> to sail as far as Greece: and this was not long before they carried away Io the daughter of Inachus, from Argos. The Cares first infested the Greek seas with piracy, and then Minos the son of Europa got up a potent fleet, and sent out Colonies: for Diodorus [212] tells us, that the Cyclades islands, those near Crete, were at first desolate and uninhabited; but Minos having a potent fleet, sent many Colonies out of Crete, and peopled many of them; and particularly that the island Carpathus was first seized by the soldiers of Minos: Syme lay waste and desolate 'till Triops came thither with a Colony under Chthonius: Strongyle or Naxus was first inhabited by the Thracians in the days of Boreas, a little before the Argonautic Expedition: Samsos was, at first desert, and inhabited only by a great multitude of terrible wild beasts, 'till Macareus peopled it, as he did also the islands Chius and Cos. Lesbos lay waste and desolate 'till Xanthus sailed thither with a Colony: Tenedos lay desolate 'till Tennes, a little before the Trojan war, sailed thither from Troas. Aristæus, who married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus, carried a Colony from Thebes into Cæa, an island not inhabited before: the island Rhodes was at first called Ophiusa, being full of serpents, before Phorbas, a Prince of Argos, went thither, and made it habitable by destroying the serpents, which was about the end of Solomon's Reign; in memory of which he is delineated in the heavens in the Constellation of Ophiuchus. The discovery of this and some other islands made a report that they rose out of the Sea: in Asia Delos emersit, & Hiera, & Anaphe, & Rhodus, saith [213] Ammianus: and [214] Pliny; claræ jampridem insulæ, Delos & Rhodos memoriæ produntur enatæ, postea minores, ultra Melon Anaphe, inter Lemnum & Hellespontum Nea, inter Lebedum & Teon Halone, &c.|$|E
60|$|In {{the days}} of Ammon a body of the Edomites fled from David into Egypt, with their young King Hadad, as above; and carried thither their skill in navigation: and this seems to have given {{occasion}} to the Egyptians to build a fleet on the Red Sea near Coptos, and might ingratiate Hadad with Pharaoh: for the Midianites and Ishmaelites, who bordered upon the Red Sea, near Mount Horeb on the south-side of Edom, were merchants from {{the days of}} Jacob the Patriarch, Gen. xxxvii. 28, 36. and by their merchandise the Midianites abounded with gold in the days of Moses, Numb. xxxi. 50, 51, 52. and {{in the days of the}} judges of Israel, because they were Ishmaelites, Judg. viii 24. The Ishmaelites therefore in those days grew rich by merchandise; they carried their merchandise on camels through Petra to Rhinocolura, and thence to Egypt: and this <b>trafic</b> at length came into the hands of David, by his conquering the Edomites, and gaining the ports of the Red Sea called Eloth and Ezion-Geber, as may be understood by the 3000 talents of gold of Ophir, which David gave to the Temple, 1 Chron. xxix. 4. The Egyptians having the art of making linen-cloth, they began about this time to build long Ships with sails, in their port on those Seas near Coptos, and having learnt the skill of the Edomites, they began now to observe the positions of the Stars, and the length of the Solar Year, for enabling them to know the position of the Stars at any time, and to sail by them at all times, without sight of the shoar: and this gave a beginning to Astronomy and Navigation: for hitherto they had gone only by the shoar with oars, in round vessels of burden, first invented on that shallow sea by the posterity of Abraham, and in passing from island to island guided themselves by the sight of the islands in the day time, or by the sight of some of the Stars in the night. Their old year was the Lunisolar year, derived from Noah to all his posterity, 'till those days, and consisted of twelve months, each of thirty days, according to their calendar: and to the end of this calendar-year they now added five days, and thereby made up the Solar year of twelve months and five days, or 365 days.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of medical {{marijuana}} laws (MML) on crime treating the introduc- tion of MML as a quasi-experiment and using three different data sources. First, using data from the Uniform Crime Reports, we find that violent crimes such as homicides and robberies decrease in states that border Mexico after MML are introduced. Second, using Supplementary Homicide Reports' data we show that for homicides the decrease {{is the result of a}} drop in drug-law and juvenile-gang related homicides. Lastly, using STRIDE data, we show that the introduction of MML in Mexican border states decreases the amount of cocaine seized, while it increases the price of cocaine. Our results are consis- tent with the theory that decriminalization of small-scale production and distribution of marijuana harms Mexican drug <b>traficking</b> organizations, whose revenues are highly re- liant on marijuana sales. The drop in drug-related crimes suggests that the introduction of MML in Mexican border states lead to a decrease in their activity in those states. Our results survive a large variety of robustness checks. Extrapolating from our results, this indicates that decriminalization of the production and distribution of drugs may lead to a drop in violence in markets where organized crime is pushed out by licit competition...|$|R

Notably, through German and French intermediaries, Otto Weidinger strongly influenced the writing of the book by Leopold Gaubusseau. The latter confirmed in a letter to Weidinger, dated 12 July 1968: [...] "in France, communism is free. Its propaganda is powerful and scientific. … In 1945, communist propaganda was using Tulle and Oradour to its benefit. It said: Das Reich, it is fascism, devastation, death." [...] The servility of Gaubusseau is mentioned in a letter from Weidinger to Lammerding: [...] "for Dr Gaubusseau, it was intended primarily to refute prominently the negative affirmations and distortions of Delarue. … He asked me to submit to you a request to organize a joint meeting. … Dr Gaubusseau is convinced that you are not responsible and would absolutely like to know you."

While many studies on intermodalism face a lack of quantifiable data, this research proposes an original methodology based on employment. The data is collected for 76 port cities, 9, 000 companies and more than one million employees in all transport modes. By bringing together employment figures and basic urban and port indicators, results of the factor analysis show the different functional and spatial trends.

40|$|Is the {{changing}} distribution of transport modes {{the effect of}} supply-side factors or of competition? – The changing distribution of land freight transport modes can be explained with reference to two sets of factors : those {{having to do with}} changes in the production apparatus upstream of the transport market; and those that affect the competitiveness of various modes on the transport market itself. On the first set of factors, changes in industrial organization affect distribution by changing the type of products transported. Using the traffic statistics by NST categories, the effect this phenomenon had over the period 1980 - 1991 can be measured in terms of shares of the market going to different transports modes. Changes in the freight structure “ explains” a sixth of the loss in market share by railroads, a third of that lost by inland waterways, and nearly a fifth of the gains recorded by road transport.

Administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) to Wistar rats induces proteinuria {{and enhanced}} mesangial deposition of circulating macromolecules. After proteinuria of longer duration focal and segmental glomerular hyalinosis and sclerosis (FSGHS) develops. The present report analyzes {{these aspects of}} PAN nephrosis in PVG/c rats, a strain previously shown to be remarkably resistant to proteinuria and FSGHS with aging or after uninephrectpmy. In Wistar rats multiple injections of PAN during five months resulted in sustained severe proteinuria and FSGHS lesions in 8. 1 ± 1. 0 % (mean ± 1 SEM) of their glomeruli (N = 6). In PVG/c rats a 1. 3 -fold higher dose of PAN was needed to induce chronic proteinuria similar to the Wistar rats. After five months 3. 3 ± 0. 9 % of their glomeruli showed FSGHS (N = 6, P < 0. 01) and the glomerular lesions were considerably less advanced. In acute PAN nephrosis induced by a single intravenous injection of PAN the mesangium of Wistar rats contained large amounts of lipid {{in contrast to a}} few small mesangial lipid droplets in nephrotic PVG/c rats. After injection of colloidal carbon in nephrotic PVG/c rats no enhanced carbon accumulation was found in the mesangium when compared to non-proteinuric controls.

The unchanged mesangial <b>traficking</b> of macro-molecules in nephrotic PVG/c rats and the low incidence of FSGHS lesions in the presence of sustained glomerular proteinuria may reflect a relative resistance to PAN-induced glomerular damage in this particular rat strain...|$|R
