The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the {{proposed}} invasion of the UK was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. This meant the British merchant fleet would not be at Germany's disposal for use in evacuations, and planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled. In late August 1940, Rademacher entreated Ribbentrop <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at his ministry to begin drawing up {{a panel of experts}} to consolidate the plan. Ribbentrop never responded. Likewise, Eichmann's memorandum languished with Heydrich, who never approved it. Establishment of ghettos in Warsaw and other cities in Poland resumed in August 1940. Hitler continued to mention the plan until February 1942, when the idea was permanently shelved. British Empire forces took the island from Vichy France in the Battle of Madagascar in November 1942 and control was transferred to the Free French.|$|E

The prime minister responded the very same night when she congratulated Josipović saying she invited the opposition leader for a coffee over six months ago claiming he refused. Milanović responded the next day by saying he doesn't want finger-pointing, but a constructive discussion about jobs, the budget and tax reform. They came to an agreement the following week and they held a meeting on 21 January.|$|E
25|$|Hall is {{generally}} considered {{to have been the}} founder of public education in Delaware. In 1822, while Secretary of State, he created a plan for the improvement of public schools that received the vocal support of Governor Collins and several governors who followed. In 1829 the bulk of the ideas were enacted into law. They provided for the formation of school districts, for holding and regulating meetings of the school voters, and giving the voters full control of the schools in their respective district. The voters were <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> every year, elect a clerk and two commissioners and set a budget and administer it. But there were many problems in enacting the plans and the original law was frequently modified. Hall continued as the key advocate for public education and served as superintendent of the schools in New Castle County until 1855.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who {{had become}} a fixture at the Massasoit House {{conventions}} where the rules were debated and changed, devised {{a number of major}} innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby was replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules. American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death. This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging them to make drastic changes. One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved {{to be one of the}} most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.|$|E
25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The marchers reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the marchers into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of the marchers from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the marchers at the church were refused permission <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the marchers resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the marchers fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The marchers resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|E

500|$|William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan, {{who succeeded}} Harry Higgins as {{chairman}} of the Ritz upon his death in 1928, was especially keen on attracting American guests to the hotel. He was a close friend of the Earl of Carnavon and his American wife Catherine Wendell, and at times the couple were freely given the entire second floor of the hotel to accommodate guests. Upon the death of Lord Lurgan in 1937, Carnavon was told that he had to begin paying for his staying at the hotel, but was given a [...] "slight reduction for old time's sake". Carnarvon later remarked: [...] "The Ritz has been my London home for over fifty years. I'm very fond of the place. Nobody knows it better". In 1931, the Aga Khan was involved with organising the Round Table Conference at the hotel, which was attended by Mahatma Gandhi and many others.

500|$|The Hobbs Company {{continued}} to interpose objections in 1913. On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list {{of changes that}} he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs representatives. On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. Secretary MacVeagh agreed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at his office in Washington on February 14. Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day. The secretary noted that no other firm had complained, that the Hobbs mechanism had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Indian's cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece. MacVeagh concluded, [...] "You will please, therefore, proceed with the coinage of the new nickel." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} agreement, the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections.

[...] Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel, [...] "and, instead of pointing out clearly just what the situation demanded, agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [...] he was warranted in doing". [...] On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith. [...] On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close.

Lucas protested and claimed that Israel is the only gay-friendly country in the Middle East, that the group was anti-Semitic, and that LGBT people in the Palestinian territories are tortured and killed. After Lucas's calls for a boycott, the Center backed down and decided that Siegebusters was not an LGBT-related group, and so they should not use their space for the Israeli Apartheid Week event. Siegebusters protested the decision by organizing an online petition; Lucas told The Jerusalem Post that his success with the event's cancellation was a [...] "landmark moment" [...] in his life.|$|E

2500|$|As Podemos {{wanted to}} avoid being singled out as the main party {{responsible}} for triggering new elections, Podemos' leaders adopted a rapprochement and reconciliation strategy with PSOE. After a brief meeting with Sánchez to resume negotiations on 30 March, Iglesias {{announced that he was}} willing to give up the post of Deputy Prime Minister in any prospective PSOE–Podemos coalition government in order to ease relations between the two parties. Podemos also accepted a three-way negotiation with C's, although PSOE and Podemos still differed in their visions of the role Rivera's party should take. While Podemos still refused to enter or support any government in which C's was directly involved, they accepted that they could work together on given issues. PSOE, for its part, maintained its wish for a [...] "broad spectrum government" [...] with the support of all three parties, though still without clarifying what kind of government was being sought or if all three parties would be part of it.

Concurrently, Rajoy announced on 7 March he would call Sánchez [...] "to hold a meeting this week" [...] to restate his idea of a grand coalition, to which Sánchez replied he would attend with Rivera. On 9 March, in part due to C's pressure, the PSOE agreed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with the PP in order to start talks, but announced they would not [...] "negotiate the accord's content with Rajoy". This approach to the PP was, however, a change from the Socialists' previous stance of refusing to negotiate even a PP abstention in a prospective Sánchez investiture. The PP went on to reject the prospect of holding a meeting with both PSOE and C's, refusing to negotiate {{on the basis of the}} PSOE–C's pact and seeking for a meeting between party leaders and not between negotiating teams, something which both PSOE and C's rejected.|$|E
