40|$|The multiple-dose {{pharmacokinetics}} of amoxicillin (AM [administered {{twice daily}} in a 25 -mg/kg {{of body weight}} intravenous dose]) in 17 preterm infants (11 males; gestational age, 29 +/- 1. 9 weeks; birth weight, 1, 175 +/- 278 g) were evaluated on day 3 of life. Blood samples were collected from an arterial catheter at 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after the intravenous dose. A high-performance liquid chromatography method {{was used to determine}} AM concentrations in serum. AM pharmacokinetics followed a one-compartment open model. The glomerular filtration rates of all patients were simultaneously studied by means of the 24 -h continuous inulin infusion technique. The elimination half-life, apparent volume of distribution, and <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> AM (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6. 7 +/- 1. 7 h, 584 +/- 173 ml, and 62. 4 +/- 23. 3 ml/h, respectively. The mean (+/- standard deviation) AM peak and trough levels were 53. 6 +/- 9. 1 and 16. 0 +/- 4. 9 mg/liter, respectively. All infants had a serum trough level above 5 mg/liter. The <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> and apparent volume of distribution of AM and the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin increased significantly with increasing gestational age. The <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> AM (1. 0 +/- 0. 4 ml/min) and the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin (1. 0 +/- 0. 3 ml/min) were similar. The <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> AM increased significantly with increasing <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin. We conclude that an AM dose of 25 mg/kg every 12 h given to preterm infants {{in the first week of}} life with gestational ages of less than 32 weeks results in serum levels well above the MIC for major microorganisms involved in neonatal infections...|$|R

40|$|Glomerular {{filtration}} rate measurement by “single-shot” injection of inulin. In 14 ADPKD patients the <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> and the urinary <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin using the constant infusion method {{were compared with}} the “single-shot” technique.

A high correlation {{was found between the}} <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> and the urinary clearance for both the constant infusion method (r = 0. 96) and the single injection technique (r = 0. 96). The coefficient of variation for the <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin was significantly lower for the constant infusion method and the single injection technique (7. 8 % and 7. 1 %) than for the urinary <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> inulin (11. 3 % vs. 9. 7 %, P < 0. 05). A constant overestimation <b>of</b> the urinary <b>clearance</b> by the <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> was observed with both methods (constant infusion method 8. 3 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2 and single injection technique 13. 4 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2).

40|$|The {{influence}} of concomitant administration of piperacillin (PIP) on the pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate (MTX) and 7 -hydroxymethotrexate (7 -OH-MTX) was studied in rabbits. Six rabbits received an initial i. v. bolus (0. 21 mg kg- 1) {{followed by a}} constant-rate i. v. infusion of the drug (5 μg min- 1 kg- 1) for 240 min. The PIP dose (30 mg kg- 1) was repeated every 30 min {{until the end of}} the infusion period. The control group consisted of four rabbits treated the same way except for the addition of PIP. There were significant increases in the mean residence times found for MTX (MRTinf) and 7 -OH-MTX (MRTm,inf) following PIP administration. Concomitant administration of PIP with MTX also produced significant 1. 5 - and 2. 8 -fold increases in the area under the curve of MTX and 7 -OH-MTX, respectively. The <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> MTX and the operative <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> 7 -OH-MTX significantly decreased, but in a less than proportional manner. The study demonstrates that the interaction between MTX and PIP is mainly due to the reduced <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> both MTX and 7 -OH-MTX combined with a slight increase in the formation <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> the metabolite...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate a potential GHB detoxification strategy by inhibit-ing the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) -mediated renal reab-sorption of GHB in rats, using the MCT substrate L-lactate. The use of the osmotic diuretic D-mannitol alone or combined with L-lactate was also explored. GHB (208 mg/h/kg) was infused i. v. for 3 h in the absence or presence of L-lactate (60. 5, 121, and 302. 5 mg h 1 kg 1), D-mannitol (0. 5 g/kg), or L-lactate (60. 5 mg h 1 kg 1) com-bined with D-mannitol (0. 5 g/kg).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationships between the <b>total</b> oral <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> propranolol and the partial clearances through its primary metabolic pathways, i. e. glucuronidation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation. Seven young, white males were given single 80 mg oral doses of the drug together with tritium-labelled propranolol. Plasma propranolol was measured by GC/MS and fourteen metabolites were measured in urine by h. p. l. c. with radiometric detection. The <b>total</b> oral <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> propranolol in these subjects varied about three-fold, from 27. 5 to 71. 4 ml min- 1 kg- 1. The clearance through glucuronidation was very similar in all subjects, ranging from 6. 8 to 9. 9 ml min- 1 kg- 1. The clearance through side-chain oxidation varied 2. 4 -fold, from 10. 9 to 25. 8 ml min- 1 kg- 1. Increased clearance through this pathway correlated with increased <b>total</b> oral <b>clearance</b> (r = 0. 84; P less than 0. 02). The clearance through ring oxidation varied as much as 5. 6 -fold, from 7. 5 to 41. 8 ml min- 1 kg- 1.

The PIP dose (30 mg kg) was repealed every 30 min {{until the end of}} the infusion period. The control group consisted of four rabbits treated the same way except for the addition of PIP. There were significant increases in the mean residence times found for MTX (MRTjnf) and 7 -OH-MTX (MRTlllint) following PIP administration. Concomitant administration of PIP with MTX also produced significant 1. 5 - and 2. 8 -fold increases in the area under the curve of MTX and 7 -OH-MTX. respectively The <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> MTX and the operative <b>total</b> body <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> 7 -OH-MTX significantly decreased, but in a less than proportional manner. The study demonstrates that the interaction between MTX and PIP is niainlv due to the reduced <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> both MTX and 7 -OH-MTX combined with a slight increase in the formation <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> the metabolite...|$|R
