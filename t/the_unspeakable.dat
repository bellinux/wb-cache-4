25|$|Previously {{the reader}} had been {{cushioned}} from experiencing the full horror of events, {{but in the}} final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with {{the attack on the}} undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair (Doc Daneeka and the Chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Mudd, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of Michaela, who represents pure innocence. In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of Snowden are finally revealed.|$|E

They had found the {{original}} printout Max threw away and had been trying to use it to manipulate the stock market in their favor. However, they caused the market to crash. Lenny drives by and manages to get Max away from them. However, Lenny takes Max to his companions, who want Max to give them the number. At a nearby synagogue, they reveal their intentions: they believe the 216-digit number was meant for them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> name of God. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.|$|E

500|$|I {{look upon}} it as {{nothing short of}} desecration to bring such a {{tremendous}} and world-wide subject under the gaslights of an opera: the most rococo and degraded {{of all forms of}} art – the idea of a sandy-haired German tenor tweedledeeing over <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> woes of Sigurd, which even the simplest words are not typical enough to express! ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone ranked [...] "Imagine" [...] {{number three}} on {{its list of}} [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", {{describing}} it as [...] "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> horror of September 11th.

500|$|The {{transformative}} {{power of}} the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired {{to focus on the}} song's power after watching a performance at Lincoln Center, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them. James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: [...] "there is a transformative power that is applicable... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> into imaginative literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Morris Dickstein of The New York Times {{was more}} {{critical}} of the book, calling it [...] "a misconceived and badly executed novel, a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> horrors of the Nazi era." [...] He described it as [...] "wearisome", and [...] "suffocate" [...] by too much [...] "fine writing" [...] (belles-lettres). He also complained that the characters are lifeless, and while they each have detailed histories, they are only [...] "verbal figments" [...] that do not separate them from one another. Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler's speech are drawn from some of Steiner's earlier works, he [...] "unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant—at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous." ...|$|E
500|$|It was in {{this climate}} that Weizsäcker {{addressed}} parliament on 8 May 1985. Here, he articulated the historic responsibility of Germany and Germans for the crimes of Nazism. In contrast {{to the way the}} end of the war was still perceived by a majority of people in Germany at the time, he defined 8 May as a [...] "day of liberation". Weizsäcker pointed out the inseparable link between the Nazi takeover of Germany and the tragedies caused by the Second World War. In a passage of striking boldness, he took issue with one of the most cherished defenses of older Germans. [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> truth of the Holocaust became known at {{the end of the war}}," [...] he said, [...] "all too many of us claimed they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything." ...|$|E

500|$|On 13November 1915, White was {{captured}} {{while attempting to}} cut telegraph wires near Baghdad. He was mentioned in despatches in July 1916. Imprisoned in Turkey, he escaped from a train in Constantinople in July 1918 and managed to stow away on a cargo ship to Odessa, Ukraine, before travelling to London. His experience of the Soviets in Odessa helped inform his subsequent anti-communism. [...] White was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in June 1919. In December, he was again mentioned in despatches, for [...] "valuable services whilst in captivity". Still in London, he met Vera Deakin, daughter of former Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, and promptly became engaged to her. White was discharged from the AIF in January 1920, and married Vera on 22March at St John's Church of England in Toorak, despite the opposition {{of some of the}} Deakin family. That year he also became managing director of his father's hardware company, C.J. White & Sons Pty Ltd. From 1926 to 1931, he commanded the 6th Battalion, CMF, as a lieutenant colonel.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Munich {{massacre}} at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Meir appealed to the world to [...] "save our citizens and condemn <b>the</b> <b>unspeakable</b> criminal acts committed". Outraged at the perceived lack of global action, she ordered the Mossad to hunt down and assassinate suspected leaders and operatives of Black September and PFLP.
