40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{economic and}} health implications of <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> a {{once a day}} low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) {{in the treatment of}} acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from a US healthcare payer perspective. Study Design: An economic model, composed of two submodules, was created: A short-term module based on clinical trial data covering the first 3 months and a long-term module that projects trial results based on published data for up to 50 years. Methods: Clinical trial results were combined with data from long-term follow-up studies of DVT in a model that estimates the health and economic consequences of treatment. Both short- and long-term costs with <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> were compared with UFH, as were health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Patients treated with <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> are estimated to live a mean of 0. 9 years longer on average (0. 6 discounted), resulting in an increase of 0. 8 QALYs (0. 5 discounted). At the same time, lifetime savings are $US 621 per patient (1999 values), even when all patients receiving tinzapirin sodium are treated as inpatients. Early discharge of patients receiving <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> or outpatient treatment, would save between $US 3000 and $US 5000 per patient. Conclusion: <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> leads to better health outcomes and substantial economic savings compared with UFH treatment when all management costs are considered.

40|$|Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) {{has been}} {{suggested}} as providing safe, effi-cient, convenient, and possibly more cost-effective anticoagulation for hemodialysis (HD) than un-fractionated heparin (UFH) with a single bolus dose {{at the start of}} hemodialysis effectively pre-vents clot formation in the dialyzer and bubble trap with fewer side-effects and possible benefits on uremic dyslipidemia. In this study, we compared the safety, clinical efficacy, and cost effectiveness of <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (Innohep) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in 23 chronic HD patients; their extracorporeal anticoagulant protocol-consisted of UFH was switched to Tinzaparin for a period of 6 months. Clinical clotting (grade 1 - 4) was evaluated by visual inspection after blood draining of the air trap every hour and the dialyzer after each session. Anticoagulation with <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> re-sulted in less frequent dialyzer and air-trap clotting compared to UFH (P= 001 and 0. 04 respec-tively). Over 24 weeks, we observed no alteration in the serum lipid profile of the patients. There was a statistically significant improvement in the dialysis single pool Kt/V after 6 months of Tinza-parin use (1. 40 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 28 for Tinzaparin versus 1. 23 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 28 for heparin) without any modification in the hemodialysis prescription. The total cost for 24 weeks use of <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> was 23 &#x 0025; more expensive compared to that for UFH. We conclude that a single bolus of <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> injec-tion {{at the start of the}} dialysis session was more effective and convenient in our patients than UFH, but at a higher total cost. Furthermore, at least on the short term, there was no observed benefit on the lipid profile...|$|E
40|$|LMWHs) are now {{standard}} {{therapy for}} the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embo-lism (PE). No published trials have compared LMWHs, and few studies have examined outpatient therapy for PE. Only <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> has demonstrated superiority to unfractionated heparin in a clinical trial. Methods: We compared 2 LMWH products, tinzapa-rin and dalteparin sodium, {{for the treatment}} of acute DVT and PE in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of con-secutive outpatients presenting to a venous thromboem-bolism service at 4 tertiary-care hospitals. Patients were treated with subcutaneous <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 175 IU/kg every 24 hours, or subcutaneous dalteparin sodium, 200 IU/kg every 24 hours, for at least 5 days. Warfarin so-dium therapy was started simultaneously and contin-ued for 90 days. The primary end point was efficacy (re-currence of venous thromboembolism); safety (bleeding) was a composite end point. Results: Two hundred fifty-four patients received tin-zaparin (39 with PE and 215 with DVT) and 251 re-ceived dalteparin (51 with PE and 200 with DVT). Most patients had an active malignancy or idiopathic DVT/ PE. The outcome events occurred in 11 (4. 4 %; 95 % con-fidence interval [CI], 2. 2 %- 7. 7 %) and 15 patients (5. 9 %; 95 % CI, 3. 3 %- 9. 5 %) in the dalteparin and tinzaparin groups, respectively, including 9 and 10 recurrences, re-spectively, and 2 and 5 major hemorrhages, respectively (P=. 44). The 95 % CI on the difference of − 1. 5 % was − 5. 3 % to 2. 4 %. Conclusions: Tinzaparin and dalteparin are safe and ef-fective for the outpatient treatment of DVT or PE. Our finding of no differences between the LMWHs based on major clinical end points means that practical issues can be the deciding factor on which drug to use.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of tinzaparin for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE and PubMed database search (1980 –December 2002) was conducted. Only articles written in English were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles reporting the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of tinzaparin in humans were evaluated. Emphasis was placed on randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: <b>Tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) that exerts its anticoagulant effect through inhibition of factors Xa and IIa and release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the vascular epithelium. Tinzaparin is indicated for treatment of acute symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), with or without pulmonary embolism. Clinical studies suggest that tinzaparin is also effective for VTE prophylaxis, {{as well as other}} indications. Once-daily subcutaneous tinzaparin is equally or more effective than intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for prevention and treatment of VTE, at least as safe as UFH for bleeding complications, and requires little or no monitoring. No dose “cap ” is required for obese patients, and no initial dosing adjustments are necessary in elderly and/or renally impaired patients, although some monitoring is recommended. The few comparative data available suggest that tinzaparin efficacy may be comparable to that of other LMWHs; more comparative studies are needed. Pharmacoeconomic studies indicate a favorable cost–benefit ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Tinzaparin is safe and effective for prevention and treatment of DVT. Consistent once-daily dosing may facilitate self-administration of tinzaparin in the outpatient setting...|$|E
40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH) {{is widely regarded}} as the anticoagulant treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profiles of LMWH vary significantly with increasing gestation. Consequently, it remains unclear whether LMWH regimens recommended for use in nonpregnant individuals can be safely extrapolated to pregnant women. The aims of this study were to assess the safety and the efficacy of <b>tinzaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (Innohep) administered only once daily during pregnancy. A systematic retrospective review identified a cohort of 37 high-risk pregnancies which had been managed using tinzaparin 175 IU/kg once daily. In 26 cases, the index pregnancy had been complicated by development of an acute venous thromboembolism (17 deep vein thrombosis and nine pulmonary embolism). For each individual, case notes were examined and data extracted using a predetermined questionnaire. No episodes of recurrent venous thromboembolism were identified amongst this cohort of pregnancies managed using once daily LMWH administration. However, two unusual thrombotic complications were observed, including a parietal infarct in one patient, and a postpartum cerebral venous thrombosis in another. Once daily tinzaparin was well tolerated, with no cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia, symptomatic osteoporosis, or foetal malformations. Tinzaparin dose modification based upon peak anti-Xa levels occurred in 45 % of the cases examined. The present study is the largest study to have examined the clinical efficacy of once daily LMWH for use in pregnant women at high risk of venous thromboembolism. Our data support the safety and efficacy of antenatal tinzaparin at a dose of 175 IU/kg. In order to determine whether this once daily regimen provides equivalent (or indeed greater) thromboprophylaxis to twice daily LMWH regimens during pregnancy will require highly powered direct comparative studies...|$|E
