His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's slaves. Tubman refused {{to wait for the}} Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her. [...] "here was one of <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had a right to," [...] she explained later, [...] "liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other." ...|$|E

500|$|The team's uniform did {{not change}} {{significantly}} after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase [...] "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept {{as a way to}} expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying [...] "When I found out I had cancer, there were <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{his first}} press conference as President-elect, Obama was {{questioned}} by reporters {{as to which}} breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, [...] "We have two criteria {{that have to be}} reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So – so whether we're {{going to be able to}} balance those <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{left school}} at age 15 and worked briefly as a silk screen printer. Spurred on by his father, his {{ambition}} {{was to become}} a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he went for trials at Brentford F.C., a Third Division club at the time. Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials. In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, [...] "Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> can do actually: play football and sing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sometime during August 2011, Parks was {{contacted}} by electronic musician Skrillex for orchestral arrangements. Parks elaborated in 2013, [...] "When Skrillex called me up, I'd {{never heard of}} him. I pretended I knew who he was. [...] "'Send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless.
