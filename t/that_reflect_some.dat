Optical devices such as telescopes and cameras will return some of the optical flux back to the source, since it has optics <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> light.

50|$|Finally, another {{complication}} is {{that there}} is no effective mirror for x-ray frequency light. In a common laser, the lasing medium is normally placed between two partial mirrors <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> of the output back into the media. This greatly increases the number of photons in the media and increases the chance that any given atom will be stimulated. More importantly, as the mirrors reflect only those photons traveling in a particular direction, and the stimulated photons will be released in the same direction, this causes the output to be highly focused.|$|E

Users were able to create a profile on the Lost Zombies website and submit videos, audio, pictures and written accounts <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> portion of the Lost Zombies time line.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{mathematics}} education, models are concrete representations of abstract mathematical ideas <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some,</b> or all, essential qualities of the idea. Models are often developed as physical or virtual manipulatives and curricular materials that accompany them. A {{part of the debate}} about multiplication and repeated addition is the comparison of different models and their curricular materials. Different models may or may not support multiplication of different types of numbers; for instance the set model in which numbers are presented as collections of objects, and multiplication as the union of multiple sets with the same number of objects in each, cannot be extended to multiplication of fractional or real numbers.Different models may also be relevant to specific applications of arithmetic; for example, combination models come up in probability and biology.|$|E

The query string parameters dictate the content to show on the page, and frequently include information opaque or irrelevant to users—such as internal numeric identifiers for values in a database, illegibly-encoded data, session IDs, implementation details, and so on. Semantic URLs, by contrast, contain only {{the path of a}} resource, in a hierarchy <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>some</b> logical structure <b>that</b> users can easily interpret and manipulate.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave devices {{consists of a}} piezoelectric crystal-like lithium niobate on which transducers are made by single-metal-layer photolithographic technology. The transducers usually are Inter-Digital Transducers (IDT), which have a two-toothed comb-like structure. An antenna {{is attached to the}} IDT for reception and transmission. The transducers convert the incident radio wave to surface {{acoustic wave}}s that travel on the crystal surface until it reaches the encoding reflectors <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> waves and transmit the rest. The IDT collects the reflected waves and transmits them to the reader. The first and last reflectors are used for calibration as the response may be affected by physical parameters such as temperature. A pair of reflectors may also be used for error correction. The reflections increase in size from nearest to farthest of the IDT to account for losses due to preceding reflectors and wave attenuation. Data is encoded using Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). The crystal is logically divided into groups, such that each group typically has a length equal to the inverse of the bandwidth. Each group is divided into slots of equal width. The reflector may be placed in any slot. The last slot in each group is usually unused, leaving n-1 positions for the reflector, thus encoding n-1 states. The repetition rate of the PPM is equal to the system bandwidth. The reflector's slot position may be used to encode phase. The devices' temperature dependence means they can also act as temperature sensors.|$|E

However, when one side is brightly lit and the other kept dark, the darker side becomes difficult to see from the brightly lit side because it is masked by the much brighter reflection of the lit side.|$|R

In this paper, we define what would be a good hypertext system for scientific corpora and the useful types of links for the system.

40|$|We examine {{two aspects}} {{concerning}} {{the influence of}} unidirectional links on routing performance in multihop wireless networks. In {{the first part of}} the paper, we evaluate the benefit from utilizing unidirectional links for routing, as opposed to using only bidirectional links. Our evaluations are based on three transmit power assignment models <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> realistic network scenarios with unidirectional links. Our results indicate that the marginal benefit of using a high-overhead routing protocol to utilize unidirectional links is questionable...|$|E

PROMENADE integrates: UML in order to define the elements {{that are involved in}} the process; and precedence relationships, triggers and exceptions, to state the dynamic part, i. e., the ordering of the tasks to be executed during the process.

30|$|In this {{category}} of schemes, the main logic of attack detection assumes that each radio transceiver generates a distinct {{radio frequency signal}} <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>some</b> physical characteristics <b>that</b> make it distinguishable from other transceivers, which is called its frequency fingerprint. These frequency fingerprints are used to counter identity attacks. However, the schemes {{may not be able}} to detect the attack if multiple devices are installed close to each other, thus creating the same fingerprints. Hence, DoS attacks can be launched easily. Moreover, this transceiver requires higher costs in terms of fingerprinting measurements and extra hardware implementation with enough precision, which restricts its use [27, 28]. Some of the schemes that use frequency fingerprinting are given below.|$|R

40|$|Depression {{occurs in}} about 15 % {{of the general}} {{population}} and is at least two to three times more common in patients with cancer. Depression is often difficult to diagnose in these patients because of the complexity and constraints of cancer care, patient and family reluctance to acknowledge distress, and the presence of multiple other symptoms. Both antide-pressants and psychotherapy are effective in treating depres-sion in patients with cancer, much like in patients with other significant medical problems. Precise assessments of the ben-efits of treating depression in these patients are important in weighing them against the costs and potential adverse ef-fects. Such estimates are limited by a paucity of randomized, placebo-controlled trials and methodological problems in the existing studies <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>some</b> of the clinical difficulties in case-finding, treatment, and follow-up of patients with can...|$|E

The motivation for looking at this problem is the scarcity of ramping resources and their increasing importance motivated by the variability of power resources, particularly due to the addition of solar power, which exacerbates the need of fast ramping units in the early morning and early evening hours. We show that the solution for the marginal price can be found through Euler-Lagrange equations and we argue that this price signal better reflects the market value of power in the presence of significant ramps in net-load...|$|R
