40|$|Abstract—Smart Grid (SG) {{can greatly}} improve the {{efficiency}} and reliability of traditional grid. As a promising feature of future SG, the Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) technique exhibits great potential to balance the supply and demand of electrical power as well as integrate renewable energy. Recently, some V 2 G-based schemes have been proposed to leverage the energy-storage capability of electric vehicles (EVs) to effectively reduce energy loss caused by supply-demand mismatches. However, most of the existing schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> is profit-neutral, lacking of adequate incentive to <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>stations</b> for wide deployment. In this paper, we investigate a scenario where <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> is modelled as an entity driven by its own profit. We formulate the interactions between <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> and multiple EVs as a game, in which two kinds of EVs, cooperative EVs and selfish EVs, are considered. Regarding the intelligence of selfish EVs, a dynamic pricing over multiple time slots is developed from <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> station’s perspective to maximize its own profit. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that through our scheme of dynamic pricing for selfish EVs and charging scheduling for cooperative EVs, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> can maximize its profit while EVs maximize their utilities.

2500|$|Recharging a large {{battery pack}} {{presents}} a high {{load on the}} electrical grid, but this can be scheduled for periods of reduced load or reduced electricity costs. In order to schedule the recharging, either <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> or the vehicle can communicate with the smart grid. Some plug-in vehicles allow the vehicle operator to control recharging through a web interface or smartphone app. Furthermore, in a Vehicle-to-grid scenario the vehicle battery can supply energy to the grid at periods of peak demand. This requires additional communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle electronics. SAE International is developing a range of standards for energy transfer {{to and from the}} grid including SAE J2847/1 [...] "Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid".

The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP-PE (protective earth) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16 A). If the circuit is closed then <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> can also test the protective earth to be functional. The vehicle can request a charging state by setting a resistor; using 2.7 kΩ a Mode 3 compatible vehicle is announced (vehicle detected) which does not require charging. Switching to 880 Ω the vehicle is ready to be charged and switching to 240 Ω the vehicle requests with ventilation charging in which case charging power is only supplied if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). <b>The</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> can use the wave signal to describe the maximum current that is available from <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> with the help of pulse width modulation: a 16% PWM is a 10 A maximum, a 25% PWM is a 16 A maximum, a 50% PWM is a 32 A maximum and a 90% PWM flags a fast charge option.|$|E

50|$|The {{pilot line}} {{circuitry}} examples in SAE J1772:2001 {{show that the}} current loop CP-PE is connected permanently via a 2.74 kΩ resistor making for a voltage drop to from +12 V to +9 V when a cable is hooked up to <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> which activates the wave generator.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>the</b> {{problem of}} <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> pricing and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) station selection. When a PEV {{needs to be}} charged, it selects a <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> by considering <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> prices, waiting times, and travel distances. Each <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> optimizes its <b>charging</b> price based on the prediction of <b>the</b> PEVs' <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selection decisions and the other station's pricing decision, {{in order to maximize}} its profit. To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a one-dimensional system with two competing <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> and Poisson arriving PEVs. We propose a multi-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game model, in which <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> (leaders) announce their charging prices in Stage I, and the PEVs (followers) make their <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selections in Stage II. We show that there always exists a unique <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selection equilibrium in Stage II, and such equilibrium depends on <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> stations' service capacities and the price difference between them. We then characterize the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the pricing equilibrium in Stage I. We also develop a low complexity algorithm that efficiently computes the pricing equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage Stackelberg game. Comment: 15 pages, 21 figure...|$|R
