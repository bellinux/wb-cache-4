5|$|In the aftermath, Cassidy says {{goodbye to}} Vitayakul and Min. Before leaving, he {{gives them a}} picture of Sofia and asks them <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> it until he has found her. He then sets out {{in search of his}} daughter.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaur {{arms are}} short when {{compared}} to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> prey.|$|E
5|$|Consecutive points {{finishes}} in Hungary and Italy saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings with a 5-point margin over Button. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> this position however, after {{one too many}} laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from {{the lead of the}} , and a disappointing 11th-place result in Japan. These meant that he had finished on equal points with Button but lost out on a countback.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the hands}} for {{propulsion}} and maneuvering is usually restricted <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> solid objects in a current. The general use of hands for propulsion and maneuvering by swimming motions {{is widely considered}} inefficient and the mark of incompetence.|$|R
50|$|P. axillaris {{grows on}} hillsides, and is adapted <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> slopes while {{being exposed to}} rain and storms. Its brown bark peels off in rather large smooth pieces. The fruit superficially resembles the green part of an acorn.|$|R

5|$|In 1944, led by {{standout}} halfback Bill Paschal, whose 737 {{rushing yards}} and 54 points led the team, the Giants reached {{the championship game}} where they faced the Green Bay Packers {{for the third time}} in 10 seasons. They lost again, this time 14–7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns and the Packers defense was able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants.|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to.</b> King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
50|$|Herman Raucher {{wrote the}} script on spec in 1969, after realizing {{that several of}} his friends who espoused liberal sympathies still {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> racist ideologies. Columbia Pictures liked the idea but were afraid to make the film without a black director; they hired Van Peebles based on his film Story of a Three Day Pass.|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Joshi has {{summed up}} the {{disposition}} effect as the disposition that investors have <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> losing positions longer than winning positions, saying that [...] "investors hate losses and will gamble to avoid experiencing them, so they exhibit risk-seeking behaviour by holding losers. Conversely investors will want to lock in gains, so they exhibit risk-averse behaviour by selling winners.” ...|$|R

5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million. While they tried <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the opening {{as long as they}} could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|Anti-incumbency led to {{the defeat}} of 47 {{incumbent}} members of parliament, including the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Paavo Väyrynen of the Centre Party and the Minister for Communication Suvi Lindén of the NCP. Among other notable MPs who failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their seats were former Minister for Agriculture Juha Korkeaoja of the Centre Party, the vice-chairman of the Centre Party Timo Kaunisto and Marja Tiura of the NCP, who had been elected with {{the highest number of}} votes for a female candidate in the 2007 election.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
50|$|The scuba diver usually {{moves around}} in the water column, but may {{occasionally}} walk on the bottom when this is required by the task or other circumstances.Using the hands for propulsion and maneuvering is usually restricted <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> solid objects in a current. The general use of hands for propulsion and maneuvering by swimming motions is widely considered inefficient and the mark of incompetence.There are several techniques for effective propulsion using fins.|$|R
60|$|She {{put her arm}} {{round her}} friend's waist and {{led her to the}} window, talking earnestly. In five minutes Mrs. Gannett was wavering, in ten she had given away, and in fifteen the {{energetic}} Mrs. Cluffins was en route for Hobson's, swinging the cage so violently in her excitement that the parrot was reduced <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> its perch with claws and bill. Mrs. Gannett watched the progress from the window, and with a queer look on her face sat down to think out the points of attack and defence in the approaching fray.|$|R

5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract on the open market, but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 percent of his shots on net.|$|E
5|$|Ralphie V {{took the}} field with the {{football}} team {{for the first time}} at the spring game on April 19, 2008. In her pre-game run Ralphie ran perfectly, but slipped out of her harness at the very start of the halftime run, bumping, but not trampling, one handler and shedding all but one of her other handlers. Zeb Kopasz was the only handler <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her. They were able to get her under control on the far 25-yard line and return her to her trailer.|$|E
50|$|The {{later stages}} of the war began with Culture strikes deep within the new Idiran zones of influence. As the Idirans were religiously {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> all of their conquests, these strikes forced them to divide their attentions. They were eventually overwhelmed by the Culture, a civilization they had not considered as having the requisite will to fight. Factors involved in the Culture victory were the vast productive capacities implied in its post-scarcity economy, its advanced technological level, and its superior war planning, all largely due to capabilities of Minds, the artificial sentiences leading the Culture.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course we}} had to pay {{considerable}} attention to the raft, which at times tossed and pitched in a fashion that made me sick all over, and rendered it necessary <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> tightly <b>to</b> prevent being swept overboard.|$|R
60|$|I {{was just}} hailing for a boat {{when one of}} the woolly-heads began <b>to</b> scream. <b>Holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the end of the canoe, both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under several times. Then he loosed his clutch and disappeared. A shark had got him.|$|R
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for several weeks before Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing else. He made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} joint manager with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from heart surgery, the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but {{this was to be}} Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams {{in each of the}} two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{the concept}} of {{intellectual}} property rights have developed and ensure the ability of entrepreneurs <b>to</b> temporarily <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the profitability of their ideas through patents, copyrights, and other governmental safeguards. Conversely, such barriers to entry prevent the exploitation of informational developments by rival firms within an industry.|$|R
50|$|The two species, Pseudopulex jurassicus and Pseudopulex magnus, {{are similar}} to modern fleas, but their bodies were more compressed, and they had longer claws which they used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> tightly <b>to</b> dinosaurs or pterosaurs. They were also 10 times as large as modern fleas and possessed {{serrated}} stylets, likely for feeding on blood through thick layers of skin.|$|R
50|$|The adults {{grow up to}} 12 - 13 mm long. The {{front legs}} in males are larger than in females, sexual {{dimorphism}} that allows males of these terrestrial and often dirty and slippery beetles <b>to</b> better <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the back of females. They are nocturnal. They usually overwinter under the bark of an old tree.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh {{gained control}} of the South Vietnamese {{government}} after General Dương Văn Minh was overthrown in a military coup. Although General Khánh was able {{to gain control of}} the military junta, he failed to garner support from the civilian population when he implemented various laws which limited the freedoms of the South Vietnamese people. He then had a falling-out with the Catholic faction within his own government, when he became increasingly reliant on the Buddhist movement <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power. Consequently, on February 20, 1965, General Khánh was ousted from power and was forced to leave South Vietnam forever. The political instability in Saigon gave North Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi an opportunity to step up their military campaign in the south. They believed the South Vietnamese government was able to survive because it still had a strong military to combat the growing influence of the Viet Cong. With the summer campaign of 1965, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces aimed to inflict significant losses on the South Vietnamese military. In Phước Long Province, the Communist summer offensive culminated in the Đồng Xoài campaign.|$|E
5|$|In September 1459 Warwick {{crossed over}} to England {{and made his}} way north to Ludlow to meet up with Salisbury, the latter fresh from his victory over Lancastrians at the battle of Blore Heath, and York. At nearby Ludford Bridge their forces were {{scattered}} by the king's army, partly because of the defection of Warwick's Calais contingent under the command of Andrew Trollope. As it turned out, the majority of the soldiers were still reluctant to raise arms against the king. Forced to flee the country, York left for Dublin, Ireland, with his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais, accompanied by the duke's son, Edward, Earl of March (the future King Edward IV). Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, was appointed to replace Warwick as Captain of Calais, but the Yorkists managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the garrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

40|$|This {{concept paper}} proposes a {{conceptual}} model of employee's job security during economic downturn. Due to the turbulent global economy, natural resources are under strain, austerity cuts are threatening public sector jobs. Organisations are laying off their workforce {{in order to}} cope with the economic conditions. The future has become more unpredictable and uncertain about the workers keeping their jobs. The fear of losing their jobs in the midst of uncertainty becomes a great concern that needs an urgent attention. The question remains, should the organisations lay off their workforces? Or should the employees continue <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their jobs {{in the midst of this}} economic turbulence? Based on this, the paper examined theoretical issue relating to employees job security in relation to economic downturn. It presents a conceptual model to examine employees' job security during economic downturns, and further argued on the possibilities of employees <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their jobs during economic turbulence...|$|R
