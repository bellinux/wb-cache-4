40|$|Porous {{biodegradable}} polymeric scaffolds {{are essential}} for tissue engineering application since they should provide the adequate three-dimensional structure for cellular attachment and tissue development. In particular, pore size and shape and overall porosity are key structural features in controlling neotissue formation. Since scaffolds structural properties play a relevant role in all processes involved in tissue genesis including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, growth, differentiation and biosynthesis, an accurate control over the pore size and its distribution, pore shape, pore interconnectivity, and overall porosity of scaffolds is mandatory {{for the success of}} any tissue engineering approach. Several methods have been proposed to tailor make porous scaffolds to obtain the desired pore structure.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of surface {{enlargement}} on the efficiency of a muon (mu (+)) moderator by comparing the flux of epithermal mu (+) emerging from a solid Ar (s-Ar) layer deposited on a Rat Al substrate with the fluxes from an Ar layer deposited on gratings manufactured in Si and Ag substrates. We developed a simple replication technique <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> <b>a</b> Si g-rating into a thin Ag foil, where the gratings consist of V-shaped grooves with 20 mum depth and ridge distance of 30 mum on an area of 30 x 30 mm(2), We obtain a gain in epithermal mu (+) flux of 1. 5 with respect {{to that of a}} Rat moderator geometry. The 15 % reduction with respect to the geometrical enlargement factor of 1. 73 is due to mu (+) absorption losses in the V-groove walls. The data imply a nearly isotropic angular distribution of epithermal mu (+) inside the s-Ar moderator and a reflection coefficient of about 80 % for epithermal mu (+) impinging on s-Ar.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} two {{processes to}} fabricate unsaturated polyesters, UP, {{to serve as}} <b>a</b> stamp <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> <b>a</b> microfluidic chip <b>to</b> apply to a peristaltic micropump. The mechanical properties of UP are great to apply to vibration type micro-actuators. However, it’s rarely discussed academically. As a result, we proposed two processes developed and compared macro- and micro-scopically. It was first observed that process I of traditional UP curing process and process II of modified process can both replicate the geometries of microfludic chips well macroscopically. In addition, the former one has macroscopic defaults like cracks, bend, and separation between vessel and UP molds, while the latter one doesn’t. Optical microscope and confocal microscope are also applied to verify the replication effects microscopically. Again, both processes illustrate good replication results with variation of both lengths and areas all less than 10 %, while process II has better geometries and lower deviation on different sites. The process I was proven that the averages of depth and widest width change rates for replication are- 1. 06 % (between- 4. 15 % and 2. 89 %) and- 2. 77 % (between- 6. 93 % and 0. 67 %), respectively. And, the replication results of process II shows also reasonable change and even smaller deviations that the averages of depth and widest width change rates are- 4. 77 % (between- 6. 33 % and- 3. 84 %) and 1. 53 % (between 1. 15 % and 2. 15 %), respectively. 1...|$|R

A world in which travelling may be indeed a pilgrimage. A world hospitable to the pilgrims. And so the modern men and women lived in a time-space with structure; a solid, tough, durable time-space¿ 	The world is not hospitable to the pilgrims any more. The pilgrims lost their battle by winning it. They strove to make the world solid by making it pliable, so that identity could 	be built at will, but built systematically, floor by floor and brick by brick. They proceeded by turning the space in which identity was to be built in a desert. They found out that the desert, though comfortingly featureless for those who seek to make their mark, does not hold features well. The easier it is <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> <b>a</b> footprint, the easier it is to efface it. A gust of wind will do. And deserts are windy places. 	It soon transpired that the real problem is not how to build identity, but how to preserve it; whatever you may build in the sand, is unlikely to be a castle. In a desert-like world it takes no great effort to blaze a trail- the difficulty is how to recognize it as a trail after a while. How to distinguish a forward march from going in circles, from eternal return? It turns virtually impossible to patch the trodden stretches of sand into an itinerary- let alone into a plan for a life-long journey. (Zygmunt Bauman 1996 : 8...|$|R

30|$|Nanoimprint {{lithography}} can {{be defined}} as the use of a mold to define nanoscale deformation of a resist, which is then cured either by heat or UV application. Once the resist is cured the mold is removed and the patterned resist can be used as is or treated through etching, metal deposition or other standard lithographic techniques to generate either a final device or a new mold for further processing. The technique is broadly separated into two categories, hard and soft nanoimprint lithography. In this context, hard and soft refer to the qualities of the mold. Hard nanoimprint lithography employs a mold made of a rigid material such as silicon or quartz, enabling the support of fine features as small as 5  nm [20]. This high resolution comes at the cost of higher defect rates from particles and trapped air bubbles on a nonconforming mold and substrate. To address this challenge, the concept of soft lithography was extended to nanoimprint lithography through the use of molds composed of elastomeric material such as Poly(dimethylsiloxanes) (PDMS), polyimides and polyurethanes, although PDMS {{is by far the most}} common material [21]. Elastomeric materials can either be used as a freestanding molds for applications on curved or rough surfaces, or attached to a rigid substrate for improved durability. However, due to the higher flexibility and thermal expansion of elastomeric materials such as PDMS, registration to existing patterns can be challenging leading to overlay errors. Soft nanoimprint lithography has been further extended to roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography for extremely high volume, low cost applications [22]. In roll-to-roll processes, typically a soft polymer mold is wrapped around a rigid roller and imprinted onto another flexible polymer web which is continuously fed through a series of rollers, yielding extremely high throughput. This complicated process leads to significant materials constraints. Molds must be flexible enough to wrap around a roller but stiff enough <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> <b>a</b> resin onto a flexible substrate and have exceptional antisticking properties to allow rapid mold release after curing. Resists must spread quickly and uniformly, cure quickly and have minimal shrinkage. Despite these challenges, the promise of continuous processing has created significant interest in the field and demonstrations of nanostructured devices by roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography are abundant.|$|R

Process variables, such as temperature and pressure, controlled feature dimensions without affecting the overall microchannel geometry.
