500|$|Kerry LePage {{wrote in}} his 2004book Some Day Never Comes that he chooses <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day based on his own choice, not that of another person. J. Broad {{wrote in his}} 2007book Some Day Never Comes that the phrase causes people to feel they have an {{obligation}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day. Mike Royko wrote in his 2002 book For the Love of Mike that people may have a bad day, not a nice one, because they [...] "confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher".|$|E
500|$|Guy Browning penned {{an article}} in 2007 titled [...] "How <b>to...</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day" [...] for The Guardian, writing that sarcasm will creep into the {{discussion}} if the British say [...] "have a nice day". Browning explained that in Britain, people assume that the day will be horrible—even catastrophic. He wrote that for the United States though, [...] "nice days and the having thereof are written into the constitution".|$|E
500|$|Have a {{nice day}} is a {{commonly}} spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers {{at the end of}} a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that [...] "Have {{a nice day}}" [...] can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} lecture, we developed two data definitions for monitors, hand-translated the traffic light example into {{both of those}} definitions, and wrote the code necessary to run the monitors on inputs. As with our slideshow and animation language examples, we would like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nicer</b> notation for writing down monitors and use macros to convert that notation into our desired data definitions. Here’s a possible ascii notation for monitors. We want to use �to depict the arrows and: to separate a state name from its transitions. (define TL-monitor (monitor is-re...|$|R
50|$|Geometrically speaking, {{these three}} {{properties}} make Lebesgue measure {{very nice to}} work with. When we consider an infinite-dimensional space such as an Lp space or the space of continuous paths in Euclidean space, it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similarly <b>nice</b> measure <b>to</b> work with. Unfortunately, this is not possible.|$|R
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosberg {{was delighted}} {{at his first}} podium finish, and was looking towards {{the rest of the}} year for similar results. [...] "I think we have a solid car to start the season with.

2500|$|The {{departure}} of founding member Bruce Gilbert in 2006 left Wire as a trio composed of Colin Newman (vocals, guitar, various), Graham Lewis (bass, vocals, various) and Robert Grey (drums). Having released Object 47 in 2008, the band had {{originally intended to}} record Red Barked Tree in December 2009, at Githead and Wire soundman Frankie Lievaart's studio in Rotterdam. When Lievaart proved unable to trace, having left the country with Gogol Bordello, the only alternative would have been Newman's swim~ studio, but as Newman explained to emusic.com, this {{would not have been}} suitable: [...] "I can produce fairly decent-sounding mixes here , but for physical recording, if you're going to record drums in a nice room, first of all you've got <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> room, and someone who knows how to record drums. If you're going to record a whole band, you've got to have the right place to do it." [...] Their preferred option not being available, the band therefore decided to book four days in a commercial studio in London, which put the recording date back to February 2010.|$|E

Did you notice how quickly he ran away from us? He's thin, too; if it wasn't for his tan, he'd look really ill. The boy's eyes are so pathetic; and he used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> smile in them." ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{students}} are very relaxed {{about all the}} traditions that come with a sittning and do as they please so as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> evening. Others recognize that the traditions in fact enhance the festivity of the sittning and adhere to them rigorously. Strangely, when Swedish students from different sittning traditions meet they will often find each other's traditions quite remarkable, even absurd.|$|R

40|$|We study two-sided {{markets in}} which agents are {{buyers and sellers}} or firms and workers or men and women. The agents are to form {{partnerships}} (which provide them with satisfaction) {{and at the same}} time make monetary transfers (e. g. salaries or dowries). The core of this market game is shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> particularly <b>nice</b> structure so that precise answers can be given to questions concerning comparative statics and manipulability...|$|R

6000|$|It is not right, I suppose, to {{wish to be}} {{anything}} but what we are,' said Jane, rather puzzled by the appeal; 'and perhaps that poor beggar-boy would only like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> room, and kind mother and sister, like you, Alfred.' ...|$|E

50|$|Heavy Weapon {{generally}} received good reviews. It <b>has</b> {{been reviewed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> presentation with humor and good graphics. The soundtrack {{has also been}} praised, as it adds to the game's enjoyment. In the PC version, some have said the controls are difficult at times; however, the Xbox version <b>has</b> been said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> decent controls. The lasting appeal for the game has not been well received, as it gets too repetitive over time.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectral}} measure of large Euclidean random matrices. The entries of these matrices {{are determined by}} the relative position of n random points in a compact set Ω_n of ^d.

The moments of the limiting distribution are computed, and we prove that the limit of this limiting distribution as the density of points goes <b>to</b> infinity <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> expression.

Smalls’ “tell {{it like it}} is” demeanor {{in the world of}} relationships and dating encourages women to be more firm with men and not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> too <b>nice</b> approach. “It wouldn't be a bad idea for women <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> keep themselves busy.” says Smalls to Sonya Eskridge in an interview with S2S Magazine. “Working towards your goals is sexy and that means that sometimes your man may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for <b>a</b> minute."Never let <b>a</b> man <b>have</b> too much access to you,” she suggests.|$|R

Aubuchon added that Tom Mason's capture helped the writer's change the character slightly. He stated: [...] "Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated. It wasn't the experience [...] He {{thought he was going}} <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> conversation with <b>an</b> extraterrestrial being. It turned out to be worse than that.

40|$|Given a list L(v) {{for each}} vertex v, {{we say that}} the graph G is L-colorable {{if there is a}} proper vertex {{coloring}} of G where each vertex v takes its color from L(v).
