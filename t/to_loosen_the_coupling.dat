40|$|In {{many cases}} it is {{possible}} to separate out the causal and temporal reasoning needed for temporal planning into classical planning and scheduling. However, where the two problems are tightly coupled, that is, where there are temporal constraints encoded in the problem which will affect the choice of action, this strategy can lead to producing un-schedulable plans. This paper analyses where such cases can arise through encoding temporal constraints as durative actions and then examining where the constraints can be broken. It is found that it is not always possible to translate the problem <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupling.</b> One option still open is to leave the problems connected only where necessary. The paper looks at how this could be done and the advantage of taking this approach. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To deploy {{context-aware}} applications, {{there has}} been a steadily increasing interest in context model to efficiently represent various contexts in daily life. However, most ways of modeling context are specific to purpose of each service or give undue value to particular information, e. g. location. <b>To</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> between contexts and services, we propose unified context that represent user-centric contextual information in terms of 5 W 1 H (Who, What, Where, When, How, and Why), to be shared among services. The proposed context can simply model a user’s context in environments by assorting complicated information into six categories. Also, the unified context can enable sensor, user, and service to differently generate or exploit a defined 5 W 1 H-semantic structure. Furthermore, unified context is structured with elements of 5 W 1 H and attributes of each element so that any service can easily exploit the context for improving service. As a result, the proposed unified context enables context-aware services to more quickly provide personalized services by exploiting unified user-centric context.

40|$|Building Automation Systems (BASs) {{can save}} {{building}} owners money by reducing energy consumption while simultaneously preserving occupant comfort. There are algorithms that optimize this tradeoff, such as detecting which appliances are turned on without requiring expensive status detectors to {{be attached to}} each appliance. However, better ways are needed to determine which algorithms are best-suited to a particular building. This paper explores the idea of allowing building managers to automatically communicate among themselves and exchange ratings of individual monitoring and control algorithms {{in such a way}} that each building manager can then obtain predicted ratings for all algorithms that he has not yet tried personally. We allow individual algorithms to be replaced by using a blackboard architecture <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> between them. We propose a recommender system that operates on a database of contributed ratings to predict ratings of untried algorithms. To explore this approach, we developed a prototype that seamlessly interacts with both emulated physical buildings and buildings simulated in software and we implemented several of the control algorithms described in previous works. We demonstrate a recommender system that selects between algorithms in various types of buildings. 1...|$|E
40|$|Transformation {{rules are}} often used to {{implement}} compilers for domain-specific languages. In an ideal situation, each transformation rule is a modular unit transforming one input element of the source program into a new element of the output program. However, in practice, transformation rules must be written which take one input element and produce several new elements belonging to various locations in the output program, the so-called local-to-global transformations. The implementation of such transformations is very complex and tightly coupled which imposes severe constraints on maintenance and evolvability. In this paper, we propose a transformation architecture on top of rewrite rules <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> this <b>coupling.</b> <b>The</b> resulting transformation system combines the simplicity and modularity properties of rewrite rules with a new semi-automatic composition system that enables the implementation of local-to-global transformations without hampering maintenance and future evolutions...|$|R
