25|$|Launched on {{the same}} rocket as the RME, the Low-power Atmospheric Compensation Experiment (LACE) {{satellite}} was built by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to explore atmospheric distortion of lasers and real-time adaptive compensation for that distortion. The LACE satellite also included several other experiments to help develop and improve SDI sensors, including <b>target</b> <b>discrimination</b> using background radiation and tracking ballistic missiles using Ultraviolet Plume Imaging (UVPI). LACE was also used to evaluate ground-based adaptive optics, a technique now used in civilian telescopes to remove atmospheric distortions.|$|E
25|$|The Black Shark torpedo offers {{fibre optic}} wire for {{increased}} bandwidth and signal processing ability compared to copper wire guided torpedo types. The sonar capability include non-doppler shifted <b>target</b> <b>discrimination</b> and multi-frequency capability that features advanced spatial and angular analysis abilities. The design {{goal for the}} torpedo was 300% improvement of passive acquisition and 200% active acquisition with its sonar system. The brushless motor design coupled with the aluminum-silver oxide (Al-AgO) battery gives the system a top speed 50+ knot, {{and a range of}} 50km, performance envelope. Like all other battery powered HWTs, the battery power system does not suffer the loss of performance of Otto fuel II types at greater depths since there is no exhaust to deal with at greater pressures. The result is a 150% improvement in speed and 200% in torpedo endurance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) {{reported}} {{its interest}} {{in using the}} Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of ballistic missile launches. The MDA is exploring concepts to use the UAV's EO/IR sensor to achieve [...] "launch-on-remote" [...] capabilities with missile interceptors before detection by Aegis radars. [...] At least two aircraft {{would be needed to}} triangulate a target to provide high-fidelity data. The MTS-B includes short and mid-wave IR bands, optimal for tracking launch and rocket burn. In 2013, the MDA terminated plans to build a follow-on to the two orbiting Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile <b>target</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is to use data from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an off-board cue to launch an SM-3 missile from an Aegis ship. Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.|$|E

40|$|How are whites {{injured by}} minority-targeted racism? For years, American antidiscrimination {{scholars}} and judges have not looked beyond the familiar answers provided by Civil Rights Era norms. According to these norms, the primary injuries whites suffer due to minority <b>targeted</b> <b>discrimination</b> are {{denial of the}} enjoyment of a colorblind workplace or frustration of their interest in diversity, including the opportunity to associate with minorities. Consistent with this view, Title VII interracial association doctrine — the vehicle that permits whites to sue for minority <b>targeted</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace — only recognizes these two narrow categories of injury. However, review of failed Title VII interracial association cases provides a far richer account of how whites are injured by minority <b>targeted</b> <b>discrimination,</b> one that forces us to re-evaluate our focus on Civil Rights Era understandings of white injury. Relying in part on these failed interracial assoc iation cases, this Article offers a new theory called “marginal whiteness,” to provide a conceptual understanding of this broader set of injuries. What the marginal whiteness framework reveals is that many low-status, or “marginal whites,” are secondary casualties of higher-status whites’ attempts to discriminate against minorities. After identifying some of the concrete economic and social costs “marginal whites” suffer from minority <b>targeted</b> <b>discrimination,</b> the Article explores how the recognition of marginal whites will force antidiscrimination scholars to develop more nuanced complex understanding of white privilege. It discusses the repercussions of this insight for Title VII law, Critical White Studies and for antidiscrimination scholarship more generally...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of state sex and race {{discrimination}} laws that were passed prior to federal antidiscrimination legislation.

Because an equal pay constraint raises the relative price of female labor, we would expect the relative employment of females to decline. We find robust evidence that state equal pay laws for women reduced relative employment of both black women and white women. We also find some evidence of positive effects of race discrimination laws on earnings of blacks relative to whites, although no evidence of employment effects.

40|$|Smooth pursuit eye {{movements}} can {{be interrupted}} and resumed {{at a later}} stage, eg, when a concurrent task requires visual sampling from elsewhere. Here we address whether and how interruptive saccades are affected by pursuit movements. Our participants pursued an object which moved horizontally in a sinusoidal pattern (frequency: 0. 25 Hz, amplitude: 4 deg. visual angle). During this, <b>discrimination</b> <b>targets</b> appeared at 10 deg. eccentricity, {{to the left or}} right of the center. They were timed so that they appeared for 1 second while the pursuit object moved either toward or away from the <b>discrimination</b> <b>target's</b> position. Saccade reaction times were earlier when the <b>discrimination</b> <b>targets</b> appeared in a position that the tracking object was moving towards. Interestingly, saccade RTs back to the pursuit object were shorter when the object moved away from the <b>discrimination</b> <b>target.</b> We conclude that interruptions of pursuit movements lead to asymmetries in saccade generation. These asymmetries could have been caused by biases in attention along the predicted pursuit path...|$|R

50|$|Within radar {{technology}} PRF {{is important}} since it determines the maximum target range (Rmax) and maximum Doppler velocity (Vmax) {{that can be}} accurately determined by the radar.

This leads to use of low PRRs for search radar, and very high PRFs for fire control radars. Many dual-purpose and navigation radars—especially naval designs with variable PRRs—allow a skilled operator to adjust PRR to enhance and clarify the radar picture—for example in bad sea states where wave action generates false returns, and in general for less clutter, or perhaps a better return signal off a prominent landscape feature (e.g., a cliff).|$|E
