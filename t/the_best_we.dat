It is quite apparent, by parallels existing between Celtic and other Indo-European laws {{that at least}} some of the legal principles that make up Common Celtic law must be very ancient, perhaps going back to the Early Bronze Age or even the Neolithic period. Others may have only developed much later, perhaps even only as a result of contacts with Mediterranean cultures (mainly Greeks and Romans) during the late Iron Age and Antiquity.|$|E

25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can do is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, {{and use it as a}} model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E

[...] Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement, along with the flexible systems used in development, the cohesion of the team, and effective scheduling. On the other hand, Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team, as well as inefficient pre-production, delays due to waiting on technology, and the major difficulties in finding a publisher. Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic, partly because of technical difficulties, and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf, with regard to screenwriting. Regarding gameplay, he said that [...] "ne of the main failings of NOLF [...] was that it ended up feeling a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be". Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue: [...] "Unfortunately, we came up a little short on intrigue. Stealth was too unforgiving. Once you were spotted, you were playing an action game." [...] The team paid attention to these points while developing No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E

Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired {{as a result of the}} incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd [...] "gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe."

Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children.

500|$|Decay {{received}} a weak but overall positive reception from the video games industry's critics. Writing for GameSpot, Doug Radcliffe argued that Decay was [...] "impressive", praising {{the design of}} puzzles required players to work together, {{as well as the}} way in which the ranking system discouraged players from competing against each other. GameSpy's David Hodgson was more reserved in his views of the game; although describing it as [...] "great fun", he noted that it could become [...] "tedious, with one member waiting for minutes at a time, while the other scratches their head, then completes an objective". In addition, Hodgson felt that the more puzzle-orientated nature of Decay left the action elements [...] "a little muted compared to Gordon's single player quest". Allgame described Decay as an [...] "added bonus" [...] for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life, but noted that as the game was designed for two players, it significantly suffered when a single player attempts to play it by switching between two characters, a point that both GameSpy and GameSpot agreed on. In his review for IGN, citic Doug Perry felt that Decay was [...] "neat in its own limited way", but that it was more of a distraction from the main game, [...] "a complementary cup of vegetable soup than a piping hot main dish of New York steak". While The Electric Playground reviewer Steve Smith stated that the control scheme for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life [...] "is about <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> have seen on the PS2 or any console", he concluded that although Decay was a [...] "nice add-on", it was [...] "no reason to buy this port".|$|E

A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically you would like to be in their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have thought that was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E

It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> can do for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win.
