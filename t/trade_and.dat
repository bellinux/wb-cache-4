We find growth-oriented managers are momentum traders, while style neutral and value managers are contrarian. Further, the contemporaneous relation between institutional <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> returns depends on relative trade size, broker use, and investment style – there is a negative contemporaneous relation between <b>trades</b> <b>and</b> returns for value / contrarian managers and a positive contemporaneous relation between <b>trades</b> <b>and</b> returns for style neutral and growth managers.
