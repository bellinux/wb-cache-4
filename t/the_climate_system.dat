5|$|Global warming, also {{referred}} to as climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> is warming.|$|E
5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Aspects of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> {{will show}} {{variation}} {{in response to}} changes in forcings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of forcings imposed on it, <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> will still show {{internal}} variability (see images opposite). This internal variability {{is a result of}} complex interactions between components of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system,</b> such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean (see also the later section on Internal climate variability and global warming). An example of internal variability is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.|$|E
25|$|An abrupt {{climate change}} occurs when <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> {{is forced to}} {{transition}} to a new climate state {{at a rate that}} is determined by <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing. Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime. One proposed reason for the observed abrupt climate change is that feedback loops within <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states.|$|E

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} of <b>climate</b> control <b>systems</b> {{is important in}} order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of their climate control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> and <b>the</b> expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> {{as a function of the}} system’s settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> control <b>system’s</b> settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> control <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent...|$|R
