5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash <b>the</b> <b>simulation,</b> which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload <b>the</b> <b>simulation,</b> shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers they had in <b>the</b> <b>simulation,</b> and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes {{the new head of}} the Zin Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Saints rally inside <b>the</b> <b>simulation</b> {{in order}} to confront Zinyak, but are ambushed by an {{enormous}} Zin force. They escape, but Kinzie is captured by Zinyak and the Boss emerges from <b>the</b> <b>simulation</b> to find that Keith betrayed the Saints and fled. Returning to Steelport, the Boss finds Keith has been declared president of <b>the</b> <b>simulation.</b> When confronted, Keith claims that Zinyak has the means to restore Earth, and has agreed {{to do so in}} exchange for the Boss' life. The Boss, determined to find Kinzie, pursues Keith into his nightmare, and with help from Roddy Piper, beats Keith up until he barely manages to tell them where Kinzie has been taken to, Keith ultimately comes to his senses and rejoins the Saints.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} and make available three web-based simulations {{that help to}} teach concepts related to process flow and variability. These programs simulate, (i) a G/G/ 1 queue, (ii) a single-stage process to demonstrate the long-run validity of Little's Law and (iii) a continuous-time reorder point/reorder quantity inventory system. All of <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> are interactive, for they allow users to change system parameters by moving simple sliders. <b>The</b> <b>simulations</b> do not require specialized software to run and are available through any web browser. We offer evidence of how <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> have helped <b>the</b> students to learn, including documentation from a web-based exercise with <b>the</b> queueing <b>simulation</b> that was completed by 74 students. This document describes three web-based simulations that help students understand the dynamics of continuous-time systems subject to variability. <b>The</b> <b>simulations</b> have been useful in introductory MBA operations manage-ment courses, and they would also be appropriate for undergraduate courses in operations research and oper-ations management. Given that <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> are simple to use and entertaining to watch, {{they may also be}} appropriate for high school students to motivate the study of operations research. This document describes <b>the</b> <b>simulations,</b> <b>the</b> pedagogical goals that motivated their development, alternate teaching tools that are available to instructors, and how we have used <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> in <b>the</b> classroom.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>simulation</b> {{begins to}} weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading the Boss to {{conclude}} Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within <b>the</b> <b>simulation.</b> Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E

30|$|To get a {{sense of}} the extent to which the change in the {{variance}} of revenue exposure under <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> reflects a reduction in the absolute value of exposure among outliers, versus changes in rank order, the last column of Table  3 shows the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between revenue exposure and <b>the</b> various <b>simulations.</b> <b>The</b> large positive coefficients indicate that rank order is largely preserved under <b>the</b> <b>simulations.</b> <b>The</b> coefficient is close to one for <b>the</b> tax structure <b>simulations.</b> Though it is only half as large under <b>the</b> uniform AGI <b>simulation</b> (<b>Simulation</b> III), <b>the</b> coefficient is still significant at the one percent level. Thus, replacing the actual AGI changes with national averages reduces exposure among outliers, while still mostly preserving rank order in state revenue exposure.|$|R

When we consider a cost-effective threshold of three times national GDP (R$ 53, 607 /QALY), we found a high probability that an age-targeted strategy (e.g., Strategy F) would be cost-effective (approximately 60 % of <b>the</b> <b>simulations).</b> Considering a WTP of R$ 20, 000 /QALY, 10 % of <b>the</b> <b>simulations</b> with Strategy F would be considered to be cost-effective.
