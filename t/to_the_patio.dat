Upon the platform was a [...] wide bench, and a single [...] wide step lead down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b> Excavations of the platform uncovered material that was dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic and Terminal Classic. Structure 7 was the last to be built on Patio B, postdating the construction of Structures 6 and 8.|$|E

The central door was [...] wide and the flanking doorways measured [...] wide.

2500|$|The [...] {{building}} houses {{a variety of}} collections as well as 19 computers. One of the larger collections is the children’s collection, {{which has its own}} room that can open onto an exterior patio. Two other rooms also open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b> Other features of the building include tile in the highly traveled portions, blue-heather carpet elsewhere, and wood accents on the walls and ceilings. The main entrance leads to the grand foyer that has a high ceiling and skylights, and is home to the library’s reference desk.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, a $1 {{million project}} {{expanded}} upper-deck seating <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> total capacity <b>to</b> 4,500 and added an auxiliary scoreboard along the first base line. Later, partially shaded party patios were {{constructed in the}} right field corner; these patios can be reserved by fans who may bring in food and beverages, including beer and wine, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patios.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Scottie's {{apartment}} (900 Lombard Street) is {{one block}} downhill from the [...] "crookedest {{street in the}} world". Although the door has been repainted, the entrance is easily recognizable save for a few small changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b> The doorbell and the mailbox, which Madeleine uses to deliver a note to Scottie, {{are exactly the same}} {{as they were in the}} film. A spite wall was erected in 2012 by the current owner of the property. The wall encloses the whole entrance area on the Lombard side of the building.|$|E
2500|$|The Natives of {{the southwestern}} United States, {{including}} the Zia, were {{known for their}} [...] "pueblo homes" [...] made of adobe. These were built like an apartment complex with a huge box base, smaller box on top, and an even smaller {{one on top of}} that. That way, it had different floors for storing different items and for families. Until recently, no doors were located on the bottom floor, so the only way to access the building was by ladders made from logs. One ladder would reach from the ground <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> (second floor) and another led through an opening through a roof and down onto the first floor. Other ladders led to higher floors. At night, ladders would be taken inside for protection, so no outsider could come in without permission.|$|E

50|$|From 1997 <b>to</b> May 2000, <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> {{was closed}} for refurbishment, where the carvings were cleaned, extra {{lighting}} was installed, and a new floor, also of white Macael marble, was put in. The floor closely matches the original floor of <b>the</b> <b>patio,</b> and was produced in the same quarry as the stone of <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b>|$|R
50|$|Teddy {{reveals that}} for extra income he {{sometimes}} {{aids in the}} maintenance of a beach house in Craggy Neck owned by a widow named Helen.

50|$|Its {{architecture}} is absent of stucco as decoration element, although mud was possibly used to join volcanic rock in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> technique of placing stone on stone, {{as was done}} to shape walls, alleys, platforms and other archaeological structures. There are two large prehispanic roads; these avenues are framed by high and thick volcanic stone walls, (some of them more than a kilometer long) that together with the streets and roads allowed access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patios</b> and ceremonial areas, constituting an important access control <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city and internal urban areas; this great fortress also had a moat that protected the city on its limits with the Valley, from possible invasions from this sector.|$|R

500|$|Patio A {{was formed}} {{by a group of}} 5 {{buildings}} serving a dual residential and administrative function. Evidence of this {{is the fact that the}} structures in the group were divided into multiple rooms with internal benches, a form of architecture that is recognised as being a palace and that may serve for either elite domestic or administrative activity. The stone blocks used in construction measured approximately [...] on each side with a finely dressed front face, tapering towards the back in order <b>to</b> grip <b>the</b> structural fill. This patio is situated on the west side of the main terrace of the acropolis, Terrace 1. Patio A has an area of , with the largest building on <b>the</b> west side. <b>Patio</b> B lies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and <b>Patio</b> C <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, a lower terrace supports <b>Patio</b> F <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest and <b>Patio</b> D <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. <b>The</b> <b>patio</b> was accessed via a short 3-step stairway on the southeast side.|$|R
50|$|In {{the centre}} of its {{rectangular}} cloister is a Christian pillory, consisting of a pillar, pedestal and base with four steps in concentric circles. On {{either side of the}} cloister are five Roman arches, with the middle arch representing <b>the</b> passage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cloister's <b>patio.</b> <b>The</b> arches and pilars are in worked stone, as is the pavement.|$|R
50|$|Holmes {{actually}} went to Nash's {{three times that}} morning. The first time, he forgot <b>to</b> unlatch <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> door; <b>the</b> second time, he did so, but returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wonderland hideout only to find some of the gang members were extremely high on heroin. After the members revived, Holmes was worried that <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> door may have been locked again, so he returned to Nash's a third time, purchased some crack cocaine, ensured the door was unlatched, and notified the gang that the home was ready for invasion.|$|R
60|$|This {{side of the}} big adobe {{house was}} of much older {{construction}} than the back and larger part. There was a narrow passage between the houses, leading from the outside through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b>|$|E
60|$|The dancing became general, and, {{the evening}} being warm, the big doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> were thrown open. Now one couple, and now another, danced out {{and down the}} long arcades where the {{moonlight}} streamed, until it became the general thing.|$|E
60|$|Wright had {{returned}} {{and was now}} standing, cigarette between lips, in the door leading out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio.</b> At the same moment that I heard a heavy tramp of boots, from the porch side I saw Wright's face change remarkably, expressing amaze, consternation, then fear.|$|E

60|$|She had slowly {{descended the}} steps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio,</b> looking handsomer {{than he had}} ever seen her, and as if {{sustained}} and upheld by the enthusiasm of her cause. Her hand was outstretched towards his--his heart beat violently--in another moment he might have forgotten all and clasped her to his breast. Suddenly she stopped, her outstretched arm stiffened, her finger pointed to the chair on which Susy's cloak was hanging.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{turned away}} then {{and left the}} patio by the opening into the yard. Nell was really sleepy, and when she had fallen asleep again he would return. He walked around for a while. Belding and the rangers were shoeing a broncho. Yaqui was in the field with the horses. Blanco Sol grazed contently, and now and then lifted his head to watch. His long ears went up at sight of his master, and he whistled. Presently Dick, as if magnet-drawn, retraced his steps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> and entered noiselessly.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next morning}} we were up early for a breezy gallop over the three square miles of Enriquez's estate. I was astounded, when I descended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio,</b> to find Enriquez already mounted, and {{carrying}} before him, astride of the horn of his saddle, a small child,--the identical papoose of my memorable first visit. But the boy was no longer swathed and bandaged, although, for security, his plump little body was engirt by the same sash that encircled his father's own waist. I felt a stirring of self-reproach; I had forgotten all about him! To my suggestion that the exercise might be fatiguing to him, Enriquez shrugged his shoulders:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{wondered}} why {{he could not see}} them clearly, and then his hearing also seemed to fail him. He was conscious of a confused shouting in the street below, but it grew curiously faint, and he staggered clear of the rest, and, scarcely knowing why he did so, groped his way back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio,</b> where he sat down beside a bush of heliotrope or some other flower that had a heavy sickly smell. He did not know how long he sat there feeling cold and faint, but at last somebody shook him and held something to his lips. He drank, gasped, and saw Harper smiling gravely down on him.|$|E
60|$|The trees now rose on {{one side}} in a dense, black mass, the ground was more level, and Walthew saw that the animal had struck into a road that led through a clearing. He {{followed}} it, {{in the hope that}} there was a hacienda near, and soon a light shone in the distance. The mule now needed no urging, and in a few minutes a building of some size loomed against the sky. Walthew rode up to it, and as he reached the arched entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patio</b> a man appeared, while another man moved softly behind him as if to cut off his retreat.|$|E
50|$|Casa Malaparte is a {{red masonry}} box with reverse {{pyramidal}} stairs leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>patio.</b> On <b>the</b> roof is a freestanding curving white wall of increasing height. It sits on a dangerous cliff 32 metres above the sea overlooking the Gulf of Salerno. Access to this private property is either by foot from the Town of Capri or by boat and a staircase cut into the cliff. Casa Malaparte's interior and exterior (particularly <b>the</b> rooftop <b>patio)</b> are prominently featured in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film, Contempt (Le Mépris).|$|R
50|$|Santo André da Borda do Campo was a town {{founded in}} 1553 {{on the same}} plateau. In 1560, the threat of Indian attack led many colonists <b>to</b> flee from <b>the</b> exposed Santo André da Borda do Campo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walled <b>Pátio</b> do Colégio in São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga.

50|$|This casona {{was built}} {{at the end of}} the 19th century by philanthropist Francisco de Urquiaga. It {{features}} a neoclassical style, popular during the Porfiriato.

Legend tells that it served as a lair for the popular bandit Chucho el Roto, reason why the house is also referred to by his name.
