25|$|A {{common use}} of sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is in the}} production of parts washer detergents. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide {{are some of the most}} aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s when <b>trichloroethane</b> was outlawed by the Montreal Protocol. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s, {{most of the}} dioxane {{produced}} {{was used}} as a stabilizer for 1,1,1-trichloroethane for storage and transport in aluminium containers. Normally aluminium is protected by a passivating oxide layer, but when these layers are disturbed, the metallic aluminium reacts with <b>trichloroethane</b> to give aluminium trichloride, which in turn catalyses the dehydrohalogenation of the remaining <b>trichloroethane</b> to vinylidene chloride and hydrogen chloride.

50|$|Before {{they became}} {{strictly}} regulated, {{the general public}} often encountered haloalkanes as paint and cleaning solvents such as <b>trichloroethane</b> (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane), pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for chlorodifluoromethane).

Othmar's brother, Franz Zeidler Jr. (1851-1901), also became a chemist and would collaborate with him on several projects. As a doctoral student with Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Strasbourg, then in Germany, Zeidler is credited with the first synthesis of the insecticide Dichloro Diphenyl <b>Trichloroethane</b> or DDT in 1874. Othmar returned to Austria before 1876 and, after working at the I. chemischen Universitätslaboratorium at the University of Vienna, became a pharmacist in the Fünfhaus district of the capital.

50|$|IBM used liquid {{cleaning}} agents in {{circuit board assembly}} operation {{for more than two}} decades, and six spills and leaks were recorded, including one leak in 1979 of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank. These left behind volatile organic compounds in Endicott's soil and aquifer. Trace elements of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott's drinking water, but the levels are within regulatory limits. Also, from 1980, IBM has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals, including <b>trichloroethane,</b> freon, benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople. IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution, though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found. Despite the amount of pollutant, state health officials could not verify whether air or water pollution in Endicott has actually caused any health problems. According to city officials, tests show that the water is safe to drink.|$|E
50|$|It is {{intended}} that the SGVs replace the former ICRCL values. It {{should be noted}} that the CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems. The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzoapyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 <b>trichloroethane,</b> tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene. The SGVs for ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (SOM) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (TOC) content). As an initial screen the SGVs for 1% SOM are considered to be appropriate.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} point of Goldschmiedt's research at the Universität Straßburg was synthesis of diphenyl <b>trichloroethane,</b> starting from bromal (CBr3CHO) and benzene and following by reduction with hot zinc forming stilbene. In Vienna, his focus changed to natural-product chemistry of plants. He found that the relations between erucic acid, brassidinic acid and behenic acid correspond to the relationship in the three fatty acids oleic acid, elaidic acid and stearic acid. Goldschmiedt also improved the method of Victor Meyer to determine, through vapor density, the molecular mass of compounds with low boiling point. The mineral indralite and the mercury-containing stupp (stupp {{is a mixture of}} mercury, dust, soot and unreacted ore produced in the mercury smeltering process) produced from it became the {{starting point}} for his research of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially the two compounds idryle and pyrene. This research took most of his time between 1877 and 1883. In the following five years, Goldschmiedt focused on the determination of the structure of papaverine - a compound found in poppy seed and opium. With his 9th publication on that topic in 1889, he concluded that the structure of papaverine had been solved. At the University of Prague, Goldschmiedt had to perform analysis of the drinking water in Bohemia that slowed his research on other fields. Consequently, the determination of the structure of scutellarin took him many years: after the first publication on that topic in 1901, only in 1910 he managed to obtain enough starting material for more detailed studies. In Prague, he also studied glucuronolactone and ratanhine - a substance found in hardwood Ferreira spectabilis (Sucupira amarela). This substance had been in storage since the first tests by a Ph.D. student of Rochleder in 1868. Although only a small amount was available, Goldschmiedt succeeded to determine that the substance was methyltyrosine.|$|E

40|$|Linear chemometric {{algorithms}} {{were used}} to model the quantitative response of an evanescent fiber optic chemical sensor in aqueous mixtures with concentrations between 20 and 300 ppm. Four data sets were examined with two different experimental arrangements. Two data sets contained trichloroethene, 1, 1, 2 <b>trichloroethane,</b> and toluene. Partial Least Squares, PLS, and Principal Component Regression, PCR, algorithms performed comparably on these calibration sets with cross-validated root mean squared errors of prediction (RMSEP) for trichloroethene, 1, 1, 1 <b>trichloroethane,</b> and toluene of approximately 26, 29 and 22 ppm, respectively. The third data set contained trichloroethene, 1, 1, 2 <b>trichloroethane,</b> toluene, and chloroform and the fourth contained these four analytes as well as tetrachloroethene. Again, both chemometric algorithms performed comparably on a given data set with RMSEP for trichloroethene, 1, 1, 2 <b>trichloroethane,</b> toluene, and chloroform of approximately 6, 6, 9, and 16 ppm from the first set, and 7, 11, 13, and 31 ppm from the second set with tetrachloroethene RMSEP of 31 ppm. The decrease in the quantitative performance of the sensor for modeling toluene and chloroform upon addition of tetrachloroethene to the sample solutions is due to increased cladding absorption features in the spectral response matrix. These features overlap with the analyte absorption features of toluene and chloroform. These results suggest one of the limitations {{with this type of}} sensing format...|$|E
