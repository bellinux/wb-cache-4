5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is {{automatic}} reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|More recently, <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> visual {{similarities}} between Yertle the Turtle and US Senator Mitch McConnell has been publicly promoted by comedian Jon Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's {{last act}} of {{political}} activism {{was a statement}} in support of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers' protest on 14 December.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> had {{a strong}} unifying effect on staff, {{bringing}} them together across race, class and employment category. During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> Professor Dasarath Chetty, director of public relations, circulated emails to staff threatening to dock pay for time spent not at work, and instructing them not {{to speak to the}} press about <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Students also joined in on <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> with approximately 1000 students participating during one day on the Pietermaritzburg campus. On 16 February 2006, two weeks after the start of <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> unions and management reached agreement and issued a joint press release suspending <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> release also pledged to [...] "develop processes for the full engagement of all issues raised" [...] during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Congress, too, {{was active}} in <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> [...] Each chamber of Congress passed {{non-binding}} resolutions urging Truman to use the Taft-Hartley Act to end <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> while also introducing or passing various bills to permit the president to end <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Ultimately, however, Congress did not act before <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> ended.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{years after}} <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> {{newspapers}} had still not recovered the lost circulation from <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>striking</b> electoral {{victory of}} Solidarity {{candidates}} in the limited elections, and the subsequent formation of the first non-communist government in the region in decades, encouraged many similar peaceful transitions from communist party rule in Central and Eastern Europe {{in the second half}} of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. <b>The</b> <b>striking</b> morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|They {{can strike}} to a {{distance}} of about one third of their body length, but juveniles will launch their entire bodies forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip their victims, instead releasing quickly to return to <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> position.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and <b>the</b> public was, by and large, opposed to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> as well. Several of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and in maintaining the calm during <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> itself.|$|R
5000|$|But when <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> persisted, <b>the</b> sheriff—in {{collusion}} {{with mine}} owners—recruited {{a force of}} 1,300 hooligans to become deputies and break <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Although <b>the</b> mine owners and union had reached an agreement ending <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> deputies remained in Cripple Creek.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{publications}} were created or benefited from <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> New York Review of Books was created during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> issuing its first copies on February 21, 1963, with circulation reaching 75,000 during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> before retreating to between 50,000 and 60,000 following <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> Brooklyn Eagle saw circulation grow from 50,000 to 390,000 before shrinking to 154,000 {{before it was}} hit with a deliverers' strike on June 27, 1963.|$|R
5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E
50|$|The unions {{appealed to}} President Theodore Roosevelt on May 7, {{asking him to}} {{investigate}} the causes of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> unions also requested that the president refuse to send troops to Chicago before investigating the status of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> first. On May 10, Dold, Shea and other strike leaders met with Roosevelt personally in Chicago. Roosevelt refused to mediate an end to <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> denounced <b>the</b> use of violence in <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and warned <b>the</b> labor leaders to settle <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> quickly before federal military intervention was needed.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1934, Bridges and the Albion Hall {{group and}} militants in other ports began {{planning}} a coast-wide <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> Roosevelt administration tried {{to head off}} <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> by appointing a mediation board to oversee negotiations, but neither side accepted its proposed compromise. Bridges was elected chairman of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> began on May 9. While the elected local officers were the nominal leaders of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> at its outset, Bridges led the planning of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> along with his friend Sam Kagel. They recruited rank-and-file opposition to the two proposed contracts that the leadership negotiated and the membership rejected during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and <b>the</b> dealings with other unions during related events.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> also {{affected}} Walt Disney. Before <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> he (and <b>the</b> other employees) {{felt as if}} they were [...] "one big family", but during and after <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> Walt felt betrayed and he was not sure whether he could trust anyone. Walt eventually recovered for the most part but never quite forgave the people who had been part of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, {{but there was no}} time to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> began August 4, 1997, and was <b>the</b> largest <b>strike</b> {{in terms}} of <b>striking</b> workers that <b>the</b> country had seen thus far. Almost 100 percent of UPS workers {{who were members of}} the Teamster Union were {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> UPS losses were over $600 million.|$|R
50|$|After {{two weeks}} the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Limerick, Phons O'Mara, and the Catholic bishop Denis Hallinan called for <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to end, and <b>the</b> <b>Strike</b> Committee issued a {{proclamation}} on 27 April 1919 stating that <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> was over.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> {{was widely}} supported. A group of {{politicians}} in Ticino, the canton in which Bellinzona is located, launched a solidarity fund to provide {{financial support for}} <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> received political support from the Ticino canton government and the bishop of Ticino, who also coordinated financial assistance. Solidarity committees across Ticino raised {{more than one million}} francs (600,000 euros) in support of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|On September 9, Boston Police Department {{officers}} went {{on strike}} at 5:45p.m. Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) failed to report for work. Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. Many of those who provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor {{in the public mind}} and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Striking</b> Black {{campaign}} earned Bo national {{recognition and}} widespread popularity in Chongqing—all the {{more because of}} the city’s reputation as a center for criminal activity. The apparent success of Bo's campaign raised Bo's national and international profile and resulted in calls for a nationwide campaign based on his experiences in Chongqing. Through the campaign, Bo gained {{the support of a}} number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping and Zhou Yongkang, all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo's achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> was {{met with}} heavy-handed {{repression}} from the authorities. Seeking to quash <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> Interior Ministry and the Railways Directorate threatened to replace Iraqi workers with Indian labourers and cut the water supply to the workers' living quarters in Bagdhad. These moves prompted solidarity actions and the spread to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to Samawah on April 16, Basra on April 18 and Mosul on April 19. The members of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee were arrested. The Railway Workers Union was banned. However, <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> continued. In <b>the</b> end the Railway Directorate agreed to a 20-30% salary hike.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the weapons}} {{traditionally}} wielded by already-established unions is strike action. Some companies may decline entirely {{to negotiate with the}} union, and respond to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> by hiring replacement workers. This may create a crisis situation for strikers [...] - [...] do they stick to their original plan and rely upon their solidarity, or is there a chance that <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> may be lost? How long will <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> last? Will strikers' jobs still be there if <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> fails? Are other strikers defecting from <b>the</b> <b>strike?</b> Companies that hire strikebreakers typically play upon these fears when they attempt to convince union members to abandon <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and cross <b>the</b> union's picket line.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>Strike</b> Relief Fund {{came too}} late to sustain <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> {{especially}} given <b>the</b> real material needs of <b>the</b> workers on <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|The new library {{opened in}} December 2014 {{and has become}} a highly popular {{gathering}} place. In addition to a book collection significantly larger than that of the former library, the new building houses a wide range of amenities including cafés, an auditorium, and community rooms. <b>The</b> <b>striking</b> architecture is characterised by the fifth floor's cantilever over the entrance plaza, a central atrium criss-crossed by staircases, and the building's transparency and relationship to the urban context.|$|E
5|$|The present Budolfi Church, {{which has}} {{the status of a}} cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century, {{although}} at least two earlier churches stood on the same spot. Built in the Gothic style, it consists of a nave flanked by two aisles, a tower, and a porch. After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall, was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by Lauridtz Jensen.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{closure of}} 150coal mines, {{some of which}} were not losing money, resulted in the loss {{of tens of thousands of}} jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities. Miners had helped bring down the Heath ministry, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear, contributed to her triumph over <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> miners.|$|E
25|$|The PATH ran {{extra service}} between 33rd Street and the World Trade Center from 6 AM to 8 PM {{during the days}} of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> PATH {{recorded}} a 50% increase in daily ridership compared to before <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Explanation: False if in truth, {{people do}} not oppose <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> or oppose <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> for {{different}} reasons.|$|R
5|$|The UMWA used {{civil disobedience}} to attract {{attention}} {{to the needs of}} the miners. The union stressed that all actions of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> gained <b>the</b> media's attention. People came from all across the country to support the UMWA's cause, and around 50,000 people went to southwest Virginia during the course of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
