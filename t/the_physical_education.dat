Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a cohort of other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's physical education program was lagging behind those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College. The New York and Boston alumnae clubs began an attempt to raise $20,000, which they believed to be an adequate sum to pay for a new home for athletics at the school.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} and analyse how elite sport students who studied at the National Sport Upper Secondary Schools with specialization on table tennis, experienced the aim and content of <b>the</b> subject <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> related to <b>the</b> learning of the subject, learning of <b>the</b> Specialized <b>Physical</b> <b>Education,</b> as well as their own elite investment. The theoretical perspective used in the study is Lave and Wengers (1991) theoretical concept the Community of practice. Where the focus is based on how the students like a community fulfills the criteria who used to characterize the Community of practice and also the aspect of "learning as participate" in the Community of practice. The results showed that the students did not experience a specific aim with <b>the</b> subject <b>Physical</b> <b>Education.</b> <b>The</b> biggest difference was in how the students experienced the learning of <b>the</b> subject Specialized <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> towards <b>Physical</b> <b>Education.</b> All of <b>the</b> students exemplify the meaning of studying at the National Sport Upper Secondary Schools with the aim of becoming an elite athlete. Therefore <b>the</b> subject <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> was seen by the students more as a subject of amusing character than a subject with knowledge, unlike what they experienced with <b>the</b> subject Specialized <b>Physical</b> <b>Education.</b> In relation to their own elite investment it became obvious that the students considered that they could not use the practical skills which were supposed to be developed in <b>the</b> subject of <b>Physical</b> <b>Education.</b> However two of the students emphasized that the theoretical knowledge was important elements in relation to their elite investment...|$|R

Barry herself was rather shy, awkward and self-conscious about her slight deafness. Barry followed Blackwell during her many trans-Atlantic moves, during her furious house hunt between 1874 and 1875, during which they moved six times, and finally to Blackwell's final home, Rock House, a small house off Exmouth Place in Hastings, Sussex, in 1879.|$|E
