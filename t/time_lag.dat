Despite a large body of observational evidence for <b>time</b> <b>lags,</b> no fundamental physical explanation for the origin of this phenomenon has been presented. We develop a new theoretical model for the production of X-ray <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> based on an exact analytical solution for the Fourier transform describing the diffusion and Comptonization of seed photons propagating through a spherical corona.

We find that the hard <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> accompany with the horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) and the soft <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> dominate the noise in the low frequency range 0. 1 - 10 Hz on HB. In the Cyg-like phase, the <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> decrease on the middle normal branch (NB) from HB/NB vertex to NB/FB vertex, whereas the <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> are roughly invariant in the Sco-like source. We discuss that the Compton upscattering by the corona introduces the soft lag in low frequency noise.

40|$|Many accreting {{black holes}} {{manifest}} <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> during outbursts, {{in which the}} hard Fourier component typically lags behind the soft component. Despite decades of observations of this phenomenon, the underlying physical explanation for the <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> has remained elusive, although there are suggestions that Compton reverberation plays an important role. However, the lack of analytical solutions has hindered {{the interpretation of the}} available data. In this paper, we investigate the generation of X-ray <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> in Compton scattering coronae using a new mathematical approach based on analysis of the Fourier-transformed transport equation. By solving this equation, we obtain the Fourier transform of the radiation Green's function, which allows us to calculate the exact dependence of the <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> on the Fourier frequency, for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous coronal clouds. We use the new formalism to explore a variety of injection scenarios, including both monochromatic and broadband (bremsstrahlung) seed photon injection. We show that our model can successfully reproduce both the observed <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> and the time-averaged (quiescent) X-ray spectra for Cyg~X- 1 and GX~ 339 - 04, using a single set of coronal parameters for each source. The <b>time</b> <b>lags</b> are the result of impulsive bremsstrahlung injection occurring near {{the outer edge of the}} corona, while the time-averaged spectra are the result of continual distributed injection of soft photons throughout the cloud.
