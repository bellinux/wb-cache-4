40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} quarter car suspension–seat–driver model was implemented for optimum design. A nonlinear quarter car model comprising of quadratic tyre stiffness and cubic stiffness in suspension spring, frame, and seat cushion with 4 {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) driver model was presented for optimization and analysis. Suspension system was aimed to optimize the comfort and health <b>criterion</b> <b>comprising</b> of Vibration Dose Value (VDV) at head, frequency weighted RMS head acceleration, crest factor, amplitude ratio of head RMS acceleration to seat RMS acceleration and amplitude ratio of upper torso RMS acceleration to seat RMS acceleration along with stability <b>criterion</b> <b>comprising</b> of suspension space deflection and dynamic tyre force. ISO 2631 - 1 standard was adopted to assess ride and health criterions. Suspension spring stiffness and damping and seat cushion stiffness and damping are the design variables. Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization – Crowding Distance (MOPSO-CD) algorithm are implemented for optimization. Simulation result shows that optimum design improves ride comfort and health criterion over classical design variables...|$|R

3000|$|Regarding {{the receive}} and {{transmit}} beamforming, in this paper, we consider three different algorithms, namely ZF, MMSE and MSNR.

The optimisation problem with <b>those</b> <b>criteria</b> for multi-way relaying can be written as in [8, 19]. Therefore, in this paper, we use the solution for receive and transmit beamforming from [8, 19] and extend them to suit non-regenerative multi-way relaying by using the permutation matrix as explained above. In the following, we explain the receive and transmit beamforming for the three SMTB algorithms.|$|R

40|$|Objective/Background The {{management}} of aortic graft infection (AGI) is highly complex {{and in the}} absence of a universally accepted case definition and evidence-based guidelines, clinical approaches and outcomes vary widely. The objective was to define precise criteria for diagnosing AGI. Methods A process of expert review and consensus, involving formal collaboration between vascular surgeons, infection specialists, and radiologists from several English National Health Service hospital Trusts with large vascular services (Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration [MAGIC]), produced the definition. Results Diagnostic criteria from three categories were classified as major or minor. It is proposed that AGI should be suspected if a single major criterion or two or more minor criteria from different categories are present. AGI is diagnosed if there is one major plus any criterion (major or minor) from another category. (i) Clinical/surgical major <b>criteria</b> <b>comprise</b> intraoperative identification of pus around a graft and situations where direct communication between the prosthesis and a nonsterile site exists, including fistulae, exposed grafts in open wounds, and deployment of an endovascular stent-graft into an infected field (e. g., mycotic aneurysm); minor criteria are localized AGI features or fever ≥ 38 °C, where AGI is the most likely cause. (ii) Radiological major <b>criteria</b> <b>comprise</b> increasing perigraft gas volume on serial computed tomography (CT) imaging or perigraft gas or fluid (≥ 7 weeks and ≥ 3 months, respectively) postimplantation; minor criteria include other CT features or evidence from alternative imaging techniques. (iii) Laboratory major <b>criteria</b> <b>comprise</b> isolation of microorganisms from percutaneous aspirates of perigraft fluid, explanted grafts, and other intraoperative specimens; minor criteria are positive blood cultures or elevated inflammatory indices with no alternative source.
