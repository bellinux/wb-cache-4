5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> {{begin to}} develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> and the diversionary duct closes, so that <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> can begin to respire. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

25|$|In a single-lung {{transplant}} {{the process}} starts out after <b>the</b> donor <b>lung</b> has been inspected {{and the decision}} to accept <b>the</b> donor <b>lung</b> for <b>the</b> patient has been made. An incision is generally made from under the shoulder blade around the chest, ending near the sternum. An alternate method involves an incision under the breastbone. In {{the case of a}} singular <b>lung</b> transplant <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> is collapsed, <b>the</b> blood vessels in <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tied off, and <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> removed at <b>the</b> bronchial tube. <b>The</b> donor <b>lung</b> is placed, <b>the</b> blood vessels reattached, and <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> reinflated.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> of most {{reptiles}} have {{a single}} bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some lizards, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites can affect <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with}} the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> but involve <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

50|$|In {{disorders}} {{that are}} intrinsic to <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> parenchyma, <b>the</b> underlying process is usually pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of <b>the</b> <b>lung).</b> As <b>the</b> disease progresses, <b>the</b> normal <b>lung</b> tissue is gradually replaced by scar tissue interspersed with pockets of air. This {{can lead to}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> having a honeycomb-like appearance.|$|R
5|$|The {{critical}} {{issue is the}} filtering capacity of the lung system. Small bubbles may pass through <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> into the systemic circulation.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> to be breathed out.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. <b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lungs</b> of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E

5|$|The major {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is gas exchange between <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, {{a very thin}} diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> via the blood. The invasion of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
