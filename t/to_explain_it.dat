5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity.

25|$|Some {{doubt this}} biographical {{interpretation}} of Nemean 7 {{since it is}} largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave {{different versions of the}} myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma. Nemean 7 in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> so far with no agreed success.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{the sinking of the}} Clan Ranald is still undetermined. Many {{theories}} have been put forward to try <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> One of these theories was that the vessel struck Marion Reef. However, this was dismissed, as an inspection of the hull revealed that there were no holes that indicated that the vessel hit any underwater obstruction. Other theories include the water ballast tanks were not emptied or that the sea cock was opened throughout the journey. Some even suggested that most of the crew were drunk at that time.|$|E

25|$|When the JILA team {{raised the}} {{magnetic}} field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud. Carl Wieman explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should {{not be enough to}} cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms, energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.|$|E
25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms., titled Flos Duellatorum, was {{believed}} to have been lost in World War II and only resurfaced in a private collection in Italy in 2005. Novati described this manuscript as an unbound collection of leaves, covered with a cardboard folder with a marbled paper cover. The Pisani Dossi Ms. is the only manuscript in the series that includes a date, claiming to be completed on 10 February 1409 after six months of effort. It consists of 36 folia and possesses two different prologues, one in Renaissance Latin and one in Italian. The body of the text consists of four to six illustrations per page, each with only a brief couplet or quatrain <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> This manuscript is typically referred to as either the 'Novati' or 'Pisani Dossi version'.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} inaugurated {{planning for}} the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New Look in his State of the Union message in January 1954 and Secretary Wilson helped <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> More defense for less money was possible, he said. With new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and materiel, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.|$|E
