25|$|Foreign {{involvement}} in the Syrian Civil War refers to political, military and operational support to parties involved in the ongoing conflict in Syria that began in March 2011, as well as active foreign involvement. Most parties involved {{in the war in}} Syria receive various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from foreign countries and entities based outside Syria. The ongoing conflict in Syria is widely described as a series of overlapping proxy wars between the regional and world powers, primarily between the U.S. and Russia as well as between Iran and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> hinges on responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine moderating effects of gender role identification, sex, and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> on the buffering role <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> on cardiovascular responses. We hypothesized that (a) gender role identification, more than sex, would moderate the effect <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> and (b) to obtain optimal attenuating effects <b>of</b> social <b>support,</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> provided should match <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> preferred in terms of one’s gender role identification. That is, feminine participants would benefit more from relatively direct support, whereas masculine participants would benefit more from indirect support. Healthy participants (N¼ 100) performed a psychological stressor in the presence of a friend, after mental activation of a friend, or alone. Results revealed no moderating effects of gender role identification whether or not in combination with <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Nevertheless, results demonstrated an attenuating effect <b>of</b> mental <b>support</b> on heart rate and cardiac output in men. It is concluded that pathways linking social relationships and health may differ between women and men...|$|R

[...] Such social supports may be done through a formal process, such as under the auspices of a non-governmental organization, religious organization, or homeless ministry, or may be done on an individual basis.

2500|$|Around {{the late}} 2000s, in Santa Barbara {{and other areas}} in California, groups of {{recently}} homeless began to camp out in their cars in parking lots with the coordinated support of a local non-profit group. These individuals and families were often unable to afford rent or mortgage, but still had jobs, cars, insurance and other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> structures. In Santa Barbara, an estimated 55 individuals camped out every night in various private and public lots, some reserved for women only. As more people began to camp in their vehicles, California cities began to [...] pass laws against sleeping in vehicles, like the 2013 ordinance passed in Palo Alto. However, many of these laws in different municipalities were later struck down in higher courts as unconstitutional, like the Los Angeles ban which was judged by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014. Some cities chose to repeal their own bans on sleeping in vehicles. In Los Angeles in 2015, approximately 9,500 homeless have turned their cars into homes.
