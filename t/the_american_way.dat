25|$|Focus on the Family {{supports}} {{private school}} vouchers and {{tax credits for}} religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's education, and encourages parents to visit their children's schools {{to ask questions and}} to join the PTA so that they may voice their opinions. Dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinence-only. According to People for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Way,</b> Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools. Critics, such as People for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Way,</b> allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools. Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Among American Indians (AIs), an {{important}} {{relationship has been}} theorized between cultural identification and substance abuse, including smoking. We investigated the relationship between cultural identification and smoking among AI adults. Design. Using the Orthogonal Cultural Identification Scale (OCIS), we {{examined the relationship between}} AI and White cultural identification and cigarette use in a sample of AI recruited at an urban Indian center (n= 217). Results. We found that high AIs identification predicted smoker status and high White identification predicted non-smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Orthogonal cultural identification status (categorized as high White/high AI, high White/low AI, low White/high AI, or low White/low AI) did not predict smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. OCIS item analysis revealed that positive responses to the individual OCIS items 'My family lives by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> of life,' 'I live by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> of life,' and 'I am a success in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> of life' predicted smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Conclusions. Our data suggest that, among some groups of urban AIs, recreational smoking is associated with AI cultural identification...|$|R

It will shed light through surveys done from Finnish high school students and randomly selected Americans about bottle recycling behaviour. In addition, two supportive surveys were administered to bring validity about the possible behavioral change through properly implemented recycling systems. The main conclusion is that through a proper implementation of a bottle recycling system, American’s behavior can change towards a more sustainable future...|$|R

With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> of life.

25|$|Japan {{would take}} {{advantage}} of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> of life would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E
