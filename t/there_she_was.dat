5|$|In July 1940, Graf Zeppelin was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and {{remained}} there {{for nearly a}} year. While <b>there,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> used as a storage depot for Germany's hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed deep enough into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and Graf Zeppelin was returned to Gotenhafen. <b>There,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> used as a store ship for timber.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. <b>There</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|After {{marrying a}} U.S. Army non-commissioned officer in 1950, Katsura emigrated {{with him to}} the United States in 1951. <b>There</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> invited to play in the 1952 U.S.-sponsored World Three-Cushion Championship, {{ultimately}} taking seventh place at that competition. Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament.

5|$|After the French Revolution, she {{was renamed}} Vengeur du Peuple and {{took part in}} the Glorious First of June. <b>There,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{disabled}} after a furious duel with HMS Brunswick and surrendered after losing hope of being rescued by a French ship.

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. <b>There</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's peacetime career, she {{frequently}} {{took part}} in fleet reviews. In 1934, she went on a tour with the royal yacht to eastern Africa, and she made another foreign cruise two years later to Germany during the 1936 Summer Olympics being held <b>there.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> involved in the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s; she evacuated Italian nationals in August 1936, and while returning to Italy, suffered an explosion in an aviation gas tank that necessitated major repairs. The ship supported the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the Atlantic to Dakar, proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. <b>There</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{she went}} to Oslo, visiting the Van Gogh {{exhibition}} and seeing the Edvard Munch paintings <b>there.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> inspired by a display of classical era pots at the Oslo Museum of Craft and Design to create her Amfora ("Amphora") print. The marriage with Leander did not last long, and by 1949 she was travelling Europe with the painter Jaakko ("Jaska") Somersalo, who became her second husband. He taught her the technique of woodcut printing and inspired her to paint. They divorced in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, OMM {{published}} an article about Allen's success through MySpace, and she received her first major mainstream coverage appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later. The popularity of her songs convinced her label to allow her more creative control over the album and {{to use some of}} the songs that she had written instead of attempting to work with mainstream producers. Allen found herself distracted by the publicity, so to focus on finishing the album, she travelled to the United States to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson. <b>There,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able to complete {{the second half of the}} album in approximately two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees {{ever since the}} Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933.

Once <b>there</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E

A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop inspired Watts to quit her job and to pursue her acting ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher began {{attending}} lunches {{regularly at}} the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), {{a think tank}} founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. <b>There</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became {{the face of the}} ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.|$|E

5|$|West Avenal (ID-3871) was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 1 February with Lieutenant Commander Franz Patterson, USNRF, in command. West Avenal {{took on an}} initial load of flour and departed San Francisco on 17 April for New York. She soon developed a steering gear problem and put in at San Diego for repairs.
