5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is upset}} that his {{daughter}} Jada would rather spend Christmas with her mother than him. At the party, Jada begins to lose interest, but Pam and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) try to find fun activities for her; however, Andy ends up ruining most of them. Darryl then takes her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> room, where she is impressed with the snacks in the vending machines. They take out the snacks and hand them to employees. When she hands one to Michael, he decides to dress up as Santa again so she can tell him what she wants for Christmas as Holly looks on with admiration.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break.</b> Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E

Kiprusoff then showed a return to form by making 41 saves to lead the Flames to a 4–3 shootout win over Vancouver the {{following}} night. Victories over the Nashville Predators and St. Louis Blues allowed the Flames to enter the All-Star break on a four-game winning streak. Posting a 10–3–3 record in the 16 games leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break,</b> the Flames had pulled themselves to within two points of the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, and stood six points shy of fourth in the conference.|$|E

5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
5|$|Ulis debuted {{with the}} Suns on October 26, 2016 against the Sacramento Kings. He posted 2 points, a rebound, an assist, a steal, and a block in 13 minutes of action during the blowout loss, but {{was on the}} court as Phoenix cut the deficit from 26 to 10 points at one point. His play in mop-up time earned him {{a role in the}} second unit. On October 31, Ulis posted a team-high 6 assists in 18 minutes of play against the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 18, he scored a season-high 10 points and 4 steals in a 116–96 win over the Indiana Pacers. He matched the 4 steals and added 4 rebounds the next night against the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 14, he was {{assigned}} to the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA Development League. He managed to record 13 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds in a loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors before returning to Phoenix to play against the San Antonio Spurs the next day. On December 29, he matched his season and career high with 10 points in 15 minutes in a 99–91 win over the Toronto Raptors. On February 8, there was an oncourt altercation between the Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies resulting in suspensions and fines, including a $15,000 fine for Ulis (who came to the defense of Booker). On February 11, 2017, Ulis recorded a career-high 13 points and tied another career high with six assists in a 133–102 loss to the Houston Rockets. On February 17, he had his number retired at Marian Catholic. Following the break for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, Ulis was moved into the main rotation of players ahead of Brandon Knight. In his new role, Ulis set new career-highs in assists on February 28 against Memphis (7), and March 2 against Charlotte (8); and new career-highs in points on March 3 against Oklahoma City (14) and March 5 against Boston (20, including a buzzer beater game-winning three point shot). Ulis helped improve the team's assist production post All-Star break from 18.6 assists per game (tied for last in the NBA) prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> to 24.8 per game in the first two weeks after the break. Ulis received his first NBA start (in place of an injured, resting Eric Bledsoe) on March 15 against the Sacramento Kings and former Kentucky teammate Skal Labissière, who had a career-high 32 points. Ulis record his first career double-double with 13 points and a season-high 13 assists in a 107–101 loss against the Kings. Ulis became the first Suns rookie with at least 12 points and 12 assists in a game since Steve Nash in November 1996. Two days later, Ulis, making his second career NBA start, scored 19 points and added eight assists in a 109–103 loss to Orlando Magic. On March 30, he had 16 points and matched his career best with 13 assists in a 124–118 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 2, he had a near triple-double with career highs of 34 points and nine rebounds as well as nine assists in a 123–116 loss to the Houston Rockets. The 34 points was a 2016–17 season single-game high for all NBA rookies. Ulis was subsequently named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for April, becoming the second Suns rookie to win the award during the 2016–17 season (after Marquese Chriss in January). It was the first time two different Suns earned the award in the same season since the 1987–88 NBA season. Ulis ended April by leading all rookies in points (20.7) and assists (6.8), while also recording 3.8 rebounds. His average of 20.7 points and 6.8 assists was the most by an NBA rookie in a month since Damian Lillard in March 2013. While he averaged 7.3 points, 3.7 assists, and 1.6 rebounds in 61 games for the season, he averaged 16.1 points and 8.5 assists in games that he started. Ulis finished 14th in the voting for the 10-man NBA All-Rookie team.|$|E

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{international}} politics, it has been argued that the end of the Cold War contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> up of Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia lost its strategic international political importance as an intermediary between the Eastern and Western blocs. As a consequence, Yugoslavia lost the economic and political support provided by the West, and increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reform its institutions made it impossible for the Yugoslav reformist elite to respond to rising social disorder. The collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union undermined the country's ideological basis and encouraged anti-communist and nationalist forces in the Western-oriented republics of Croatia and Slovenia to increase their demands.|$|E
25|$|After his father's death, Charles Louis, who {{was only}} three years old, succeeded him as King Charles Louis I of Etruria. He was under the regency of his mother Maria Luisa.

Charles Louis was promised the throne of a new Kingdom of Northern Lusitania (in the north of Portugal), but this plan never materialized, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> between Napoleon and the Spanish Bourbons in 1808.

Pringle made one last journey through the jungle to inform his Chinese friends. The news was immediately broken to the British other ranks' compound, and quickly spread to the other compounds. Celebratory meals were prepared, with precious supplies and livestock used up. The Japanese guards were unaware of their country's surrender, and as the day coincided with an official camp holiday, marking the opening of the camp on 15 August three years previously, they were satisfied that the celebrations were related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> from the working parties.
