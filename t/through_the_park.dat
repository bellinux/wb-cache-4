25|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> {{features}} a 2.4 mile Scenic Loop <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> pastoral setting featuring rolling hills, open meadows and woodlands with separate lanes for vehicle traffic (one-way) and recreational users.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} bike paths for local cyclists <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> along Kingscliff's beaches. The {{neighboring}} town of Salt is accessible via a bike path.|$|R
5|$|The {{road that}} is {{currently}} SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in Woodward and headed north, then turned east {{north of the city}} and headed to Boiling Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> had been removed from the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.|$|E
5|$|A park pass is {{required}} for stopping {{in the park and}} permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.|$|E
5|$|Canoeing {{or other}} non-motorized boating {{is the most}} popular method of {{exploring}} the BWCAW. A 2007 study found more than 94% of overnight visitors used a non-motorized boat to travel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> The BWCAW's size and abundance of campsites, lakes, rivers and portage trails allow for almost countless options for different routes. Many online maps and guidebooks offer suggested routes based on entry point, duration and difficulty.|$|E
50|$|Taksin Maharat National Park is 26 km west of Tak town in Mae Sot District. <b>The</b> <b>park's</b> area is 149 km2. The {{mountains}} of the Thanon Thongchai Range run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> centre.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park's</b> trails {{include an}} 8.5 mi loop <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> undeveloped area. There {{is also an}} 18-hole golf course, open all year round, which winds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> forest. There is a large {{swimming}} pool open during the summer months.|$|R
50|$|North of {{the contact}} station is an interpretive hiking trail, which passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> old growth forest area. The Appalachian Trail, which {{branches}} from the Long Trail {{on the mountain}} ridge above <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> runs east-west <b>through</b> <b>the</b> campground and around Kent Pond.|$|R
5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E
5|$|Crimea's coastal highway runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> {{dividing}} it {{into the}} upper and lower portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern fa√ßade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{consolidate}} territory under their control, Croatian Serb leaders organised a political rally at the Plitvice Lakes on 25 March 1991, demanding the area be annexed to the SAO Krajina. Three days later, on 28 March, SAO Krajina special police seized the area, {{and with the help}} of armed civilians, removed the Croatian management of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. The force deployed by the SAO Krajina to the Plitvice Lakes was estimated to be approximately 100-strong. The region was relatively sparsely populated and there was no obvious threat to Serbs there. Journalist Tim Judah suggests that the move may have been motivated by a desire to control a strategic road that ran north-south <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> linking the Serb communities in the Lika and Banovina regions.|$|E
50|$|Popular {{activities}} include model rocket launching, kite flying, picnicking, dog walking, jogging and walking. Although on a peninsula, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> has {{no access to}} the water {{because there are no}} beaches nor steps down <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> reinforced shoreline.|$|R

50|$|As part of {{its annual}} {{fund-raising}} efforts, the Foundation promotes Deckchair Dreams, through which artists donate individual works of art for the canvases of deck chairs which are reproduced and distributed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway was {{instrumental}} in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5million in the 1990s. Millions more pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study, which resulted in management recommendations, and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.|$|E
5|$|The Don Valley Parkway {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the Gardiner Expressway {{near the mouth}} of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway401.|$|E
5|$|The first {{coherent}} landscaping in Hyde Park {{began in}} 1726. It was undertaken by Charles Bridgeman for King George I, but following the king's death the following year, it continued with approval of his daughter-in-law, Queen Caroline. Work was undertaken {{under the supervision}} of Charles Withers, the Surveyor-General of Woods and Forests. The principal effect of the work was to sub-divide Hyde Park and create Kensington Gardens. The Serpentine was formed by damming the River Westbourne, which runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> from Kilburn towards the Thames. It is divided from the Long Water by a bridge designed by George Rennie in 1826.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{call for}} the farm to be {{connected}} to the main unit of <b>the</b> preserve <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> network of trails by passing through privately owned land on which the state owns conservation easements.|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} Lake Gilman is Obalski Park. Its amenities {{include a}} beach, pier, picnic tables, cabins, among others. The many trails allow for hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing, or even snowmobiling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> boreal forest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> {{features}} a 7.7 mi round trip hiking trail <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> undeveloped area. There {{is also a}} small lake open for canoeing and fishing. The lake is stocked with crappie, catfish and bass year around and with rainbow trout in winter. Camping and picnicking areas are available.|$|R
5|$|The {{house is}} {{surrounded}} by a deer park which was landscaped by Capability Brown from 1775. He established a winding path, known as Capability Brown path, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E
5|$|The trails <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take a short break or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve the}} growing {{population}} of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an electric tramway, was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation. The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road. The tramway {{was made into a}} circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The tramway closed in 1959. Its route <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is now a footpath.|$|E
50|$|Police {{protection}} within <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{is provided}} by <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> Law Enforcement Ranger staff and local Maine IF&W Wardens. Fire protection provided by the Maine Forest Service; waste disposal and recycling is addressed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> Carry-In, Carry-Out policy. Maintenance {{is done by the}} many volunteer workers and paid employees of <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> current <b>Park</b> Director is Jensen Bissell.|$|R
50|$|Louisiana's Jocco's Mardi Gras Madness {{was a dark}} ride {{built by}} Sally Corporation at Six Flags New Orleans. It {{was one of the}} most popular rides at that Six Flags location. It ran from 2000 <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> closing in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Culgoa River flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} <b>park.</b>|$|R
5|$|Washington Park is {{the site}} of many festivals, concerts, and special occasions. The Tulip Festival held every year since 1949 in Washington Park is {{highlighted}} by the blossoming of 200,000 tulips throughout the park. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest and since 1998 the Tulip Fest has also included the Mother of the Year award. The Latin Festival and the Columbus Day Parade and Italian Festival are some of the ethnic festivals held every year in the park. The city, the Albany Police Athletic League, and Hannaford supermarkets sponsor the Capital Holiday Lights every winter, with 125 displays <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Proceeds benefit juvenile crime prevention programs.|$|E
5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the Theodore Kazimiroff Environmental Center was {{proposed}} for <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> alongside a nature trail that would wind <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> terrain. It would be named {{out of respect}} to the late historian, {{who had died in}} 1980. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail and <b>the</b> Pelham Bay <b>Park</b> Environmental Center opened in June 1986.|$|R
25|$|Two major bicycle paths serve Jamaica Plain. Along <b>the</b> Southwest Corridor <b>Park</b> is <b>the</b> Pierre Lallement Bicycle Path, {{which runs}} from Forest Hills to Back Bay. To {{the west are}} bicycle paths, which run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> of <b>the</b> Emerald Necklace, along the Jamaicaway and Riverway.|$|R
50|$|The main public {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{is located on}} Branch Road, near the intersection of Forest Road North, 5 km north of Lara and 5 km west of Little River. The gate is open daylight hours. Sandy Creek Road also passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> western area, providing a link between Lara and Balliang.|$|R
