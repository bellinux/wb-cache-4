In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting {{has been found to}} be 7.6%. The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not <b>their</b> <b>owners</b> are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and <b>their</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|E

The sloping bluff also allowed them to build multi-story warehouses and granaries closer to the unloading points along the river.|$|E

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards <b>their</b> <b>owners,</b> who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
50|$|When <b>their</b> <b>owner</b> dies, {{they too}} {{arrive at the}} meadow, {{and that is when}} the pet stops playing, turns, sniffs at the air and looks into the {{distance}} where they see <b>their</b> beloved <b>owner.</b> Excited, they run {{as fast as they can}} until they are one jump away from <b>their</b> <b>owner's</b> arms. The pet licks its owners in joy while the human looks into the soft eyes of their pet—who might have been absent on Earth, but never absent in their heart. Then side by side, they cross the Rainbow Bridge together into Heaven, never again to be separated.|$|R

5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to <b>their</b> <b>owners.</b> One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are {{appealing}} when young, and pet-store owners can easily sell them, but crocodilians {{do not make}} good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by <b>their</b> <b>owners,</b> and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba.
