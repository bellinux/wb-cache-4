5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

They were also both {{members of a}} marching band; Williams played the snare drum while Hugo was drum major. Williams and Hugo attended Princess Anne High School where {{he played in the}} school band; there Pharrell got the name Skateboard P. Hugo attended Kempsville High School. In the MTV show When I Was 17, Pharrell stated that he was a nerd and often did <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him stand out from most of his peers.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson had {{originally}} {{decided that the}} University of Virginia would have no president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and a Board of Visitors. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university. Edwin Alderman, who had only recently moved from his post as president of UNC-Chapel Hill since 1896 {{to become president of}} Tulane University in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as Popular Science lamented the end of one of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> UVA unique among universities.|$|E

25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> his life bearable were {{listening}} to Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and watching the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E
500|$|The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) {{approached}} Danny Boyle to be {{the director}} of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted. Boyle explained that there had been four <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him take the job: he was a big Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do. He said it [...] "felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility" [...] to take the job.|$|E
500|$|On January 29, 2008, Variety {{reported}} that Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production {{company would be}} rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film. In an interview, producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their Friday the 13th remake, by abandoning the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the character less scary—the film's antagonist, Freddy Krueger, would not be [...] "cracking jokes" [...] as had become a staple of his character in later films—and focusing more on trying to craft a [...] "horrifying movie". Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if you fell asleep. The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film, but clarified {{that they would be}} borrowing certain character deaths and dream sequences from the entire Nightmare series.|$|E

In December 2016, Kotakus Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that [...] "over the last year, the PewDiePie channel {{has also had}} an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself {{from many of the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like Amnesia," [...] and adding, [...] "the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand." [...] On the technical aspect of his videos, PewDiePie spoke about how his early videos would feature raw footage, although he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf had {{announced}} that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would say <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him {{think he was}} sitting next to Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's much more of a rock album." [...] Child says {{that one of the most}} memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on [...] "Bad for Good". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E

So many hours, so many days, so many long, long nights of hopeless, cheerless, never-ending work—not to heap up riches, not to live grandly or gaily, not to live upon enough, however coarse; but to earn bare bread; to scrape {{together}} just enough to toil upon, and want upon, and keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate! Oh Meg, Meg!’ she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she spoke, like one in pain. ‘How can the cruel world go round, and bear to look upon such lives!’ ...|$|R

2500|$|When Rumsfeld visited Baghdad on December 20, 1983, he met Saddam Hussein at Saddam's {{palace and}} had a 90-minute discussion. They largely agreed on {{opposing}} Syria's occupation of Lebanon; preventing Syrian and Iranian expansion; and preventing arms sales to Iran. Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new oil pipeline across Jordan, which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz that [...] "Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it difficult for us ... citing the use of chemical weapons." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Troma Studios and {{director}} Lloyd Kaufman filmed Tromeo and Juliet, a transgressive [...] "trash/punk" [...] {{adaptation of the}} play, set in present-day Manhattan and featuring Lemmy (of Motörhead) as its chorus. Sporting the tagline [...] "Body piercing. Kinky sex. Dismemberment. The <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Shakespeare great.", Tromeo and Juliet premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and won several awards at independent horror and fantasy film festivals. Despite positive reviews from The New York Times, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly and Variety, Shakespeare scholar Daniel Rosenthal described Tromeo as [...] "the nadir of screen Shakespeare", calling it a [...] "tedious, appallingly acted feast of mutilation and softcore sex". The film's screenwriter, James Gunn, went on to have a successful career as a writer {{and director}}, including the critically acclaimed Slither and the upcoming Marvel Comics film Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E
2500|$|Rose's thoughts, {{ideas and}} {{concerns}} {{were taken into}} consideration {{when it came to}} finalizing Tiana's design. [...] "I … said I wanted it to look like she ate and wasn’t skinny, and she has a full mouth and a little round nose and curly hair and these are all <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> her look distinctly herself," [...] she said. Rose didn't want Tiana to resemble [...] "a cookie-cutter princess who had been coloured in brown. When I saw {{her for the first time}} and realized how much she looked like me I was really blown away." [...] Rose also served as a form of visual, live-action reference for supervising animator Mark Henn as he worked on Tiana, videotaping her as she recorded her lines and incorporating some of her distinct characteristics, such as her dimples and left-handedness, into Tiana's design.|$|E

2500|$|Comics {{historian}} Jim Steranko {{wrote in}} 1970 that Finger's slowness {{as a writer}} led Batman editor Whitney Ellsworth to suggest Kane replace him, a claim reflected in Joe Desris' description of Finger as [...] "notoriously tardy". During Finger's absence, Gardner Fox contributed scripts that introduced Batman's early [...] "Bat-" [...] arsenal (the utility belt, the Bat-Gyro/plane and the Batarang). Upon his return, Finger created or co-created items such as the Batmobile and Batcave, and is credited with providing the name [...] "Gotham City". Finger wrote the debut issue of Batman's self-titled comic book series which introduced the Joker and the Catwoman. Among the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> his stories distinctive were a use of giant-sized props: enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters. Two of the prevalently featured trophies in Batman's Batcave, a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex and a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, were both introduced in stories written by Finger. He {{was one of the}} writers of the syndicated Batman comic strip from 1943 to 1946.|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I think I just got away from the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics blamed Paramount's initial ad {{campaign}} for the film not finding a mainstream audience. The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern praised Douglas' work in the film, but criticized the poster, which featured a headshot of Douglas: [...] "a raffishly eccentric role, and he's never been so appealing. (Don't be {{put off by the}} movie's cryptic poster, which makes him look like Michael J. Pollard.)" [...] The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan also slammed the poster: [...] "The film's ad poster brings Elmer Fudd to mind." [...] Hanson said that the poster made Douglas look [...] "like he was trying to be Robin Williams". In an interview with Amy Taubin, Hanson said, [...] "The very <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Michael and I want to do the movie so badly were the reasons it was so tricky to market. Since films go out on so many screens at once, there's a need for instant appeal. But Wonder Boys isn't easily reducible to a single image or a catchy ad line".|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Reiner of Game Informer {{thought that}} The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider-Man Playsets were [...] "miserable adventures," [...] the characters' {{controls}} were done well {{and that the}} character animations were well done. Reiner, however, was not pleased with the music featured within all three of Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroess Playsets, calling it [...] "cringe-worthy." [...] He also cited that the dubstep music featured in the Spider-Man Playset was poorly done. Blake Peterson of Game Revolution gave the game a more commendatory review, explaining that the game's improved combat, stronger level design (compared to the first game), expanded Toybox options, {{and the ability to}} personalize characters, were some of the major <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the game worthwhile. In spite of that, Peterson condemned Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroess bad driving mechanics, poor player training within Toybox mode and high cost to unlock content. Steve Hannley of Hardcore Gamer also gave the game a positive review, scoring it a 4/5, saying [...] "Toy Box mode has been notably upgraded and overall gameplay is more polished, while increased depth will have players of all ages coming back for more," [...] yet criticizing the [...] "repetitive" [...] Play Sets.|$|E
2500|$|... 6.82 {{million people}} watched the episode. Coupled with that night's episode of King of the Hill, it won its {{hour in the}} 18-49 demographic. Since airing, the episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Rene Rosa of UGO wrote: [...] "When the self-referential jokes about the episode’s switch to HD were the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me laugh the most, and they last only a few seconds, I realized something was not good. This may be 'The Sharpest. Episode. Ever.' but is definitely not the funniest. Still, there are some genuinely endearing bitter-sweet moments in the episode, [...] but still it’s not enough to drive the show into the un-chartable funny waters that it used to live in." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "If it seems like there's a lot going on, that's because there is. The episode could have easily been just one thing—Homer deals with his Vance inferiority complex, or he sets out to discover {{the truth of the}} election from the former principal, or it could have been entirely a flashback episode. But instead, The Simpsons tries to do all three, one for each commercial break. The show has been around for 20 years; I would imagine that there would be plenty to mine from digging deep into a simpler story line for 19 minutes. Instead, 'Take My Life, Please' crushes under the weight of its bloated plot—not to mention that the overexplanation of jokes wasn't helping matters." ...|$|E

Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in Staten Island, New York. In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw.
