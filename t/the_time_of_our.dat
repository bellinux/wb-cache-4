5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives is {{the first}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus. The EP was released on August 28, 2009 by Hollywood Records, initially as a United States' Walmart exclusive. With alterations in artwork and track listing, an international edition was issued October 16, 2009. <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives was conceived as a release to accompany Cyrus' newly launched apparel line with Max Azria. The tracks on the EP were primarily composed by John Shanks and Dr. Luke, who also produced their respective cuts. Cyrus co-wrote one out of seven songs on <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives; one is a cover and another is a live rendition. Musically, the uptempo tracks on the record are in the pop rock and dance-pop genres while ballads are largely soft rock. Lyrically, it explores the themes of romantic relationships, among other subjects.|$|E

5|$|Cyrus is a singer-songwriter {{and actress}} who starred on the Disney Channel {{television}} series Hannah Montana as Miley Stewart, {{a girl with}} a secret double life as the popstar Hannah Montana. Through the television series, Cyrus developed fame as a teen idol and released music credited to Hannah Montana. Cyrus' debut studio album, titled Meet Miley Cyrus, was released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) double-disc album. In order to promote the album, Cyrus embarked on her first tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007–08), a North American tour where she performed both under character, as Hannah Montana, and as herself. With the release of Cyrus' second studio album, Breakout (2008), her first not be affiliated with the Hannah Montana franchise, and an extended play (EP) <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives (2009), Cyrus decided to embark on tour again with the Wonder World Tour, however, without incorporating performances as Hannah Montana, a step which the media interpreted as furthering her distance from the Hannah Montana franchise.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus {{starred in}} the feature film , and began {{cultivating}} a more mature image with her EP <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives in 2009. In 2010, she released her third album Can't Be Tamed, which stands as the lowest-selling record of her career, and {{starred in the}} coming-of-age film The Last Song. Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances in 2011 and 2012. Her sexually explicit behavior generated widespread controversy while promoting her fourth album Bangerz (2013), her first under her recording contract with RCA Records. Cyrus' independently-released fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) deviated from her traditional pop style for more psychedelic experimentation. The following year, she became a coach on the singing competition television series The Voice; she has since appeared on two of its thirteen seasons. Cyrus returned to a more wholesome image with her sixth studio album Younger Now (2017).|$|E

[...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her.

The song was first {{included}} on Cyrus's 2009 extended play <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives {{and then on the}} film and its corresponding soundtrack. The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said.

[...] Lamb did, however, state that the ballads on <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives were throwaways.

Michael Hann of The Guardian felt that Cyrus managed to project a very wholesome image of herself but argued {{that she did not}} succeed in convincing adult audiences there was anything else to her: [...] "She has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source". Jessica Holland of British newspaper The Observer wrote a favorable review of the EP, noting: [...] "Still not yet 17, Miley doesn't need to worry about slipping yet." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the uptempo numbers on the EP as [...] "brilliantly feisty skate pop" [...] but described the record's ballads as tedious. Gill concluded that, if Cyrus were to take her music more seriously, instead of releasing albums in between various other projects, she might make a great pop album and stated that [...] "As it is, <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives is a great pop EP drowning in a sea of bilge." ...|$|E
