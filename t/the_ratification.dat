The court found that as the Secretary of State had accepted <b>the</b> <b>ratifications</b> by <b>the</b> legislatures of the two states as valid, they were valid, effectively ruling the matter as non-justiciable.|$|R

5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} its way through <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> process, Republicans in Congress grew {{increasingly}} concerned {{about the potential for}} there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> of the United States Constitution by {{the state}} of New York in 1788, the delegates agreed to keep New York City as the {{temporary}} federal capital.

5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> and {{implementation}} of the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781.

The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ratification</b> of {{this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population.

Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain.

5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> of the Articles of Confederation in 1781.

50|$|Beginning {{in the mid}} 1990s, ERA proponents {{began an}} effort to win <b>ratification</b> of <b>the</b> ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982.

They also claim that <b>the</b> <b>ratifications</b> ERA previously received remain valid.
