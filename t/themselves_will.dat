5|$|Inside the TV World, {{the player}} assembles a party, {{consisting}} of the protagonist and up to three other characters, to explore randomly generated dungeons, each tailored around a victim who had been kidnapped. On each floor of a dungeon, the player may find roaming Shadows, as well as treasure chests containing items and equipment. Players progress through the dungeon by finding the stairs somewhere on each floor to progress to the next, eventually reaching the final floor where a boss enemy awaits. The player enters battle upon coming into contact with a Shadow. The player can gain an advantage by attacking the Shadow from behind, whilst being attacked from behind <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> give the enemy an advantage. Similar to the Press Turn system used in other Shin Megami Tensei games, battles are turn-based with characters fighting enemies using their equipped weapons, items, or the special skills of their Personas. Aside from the protagonist, who is controlled directly, the other characters can either be given direct commands or be assigned 'Tactics' which alter their battle AI. If the protagonist loses all of his HP, the game ends, returning players to the title screen.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} link between {{domestic}} violence and child abuse. Since domestic violence is a pattern of behavior, these incidences may increase in severity and frequency, resulting in an increased probability the children <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> become victims. The estimated overlap between domestic violence and child abuse ranges from 30 to 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of penetration, as each system's capacity {{to compensate for}} intermittency differs, and the systems <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> change over time. Discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution, as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors, grid structure and management, and existing generation capacity.|$|E
25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people {{convinced}} they deserve happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since {{the development of}} positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones. For Erich Fromm, love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> be found in all those {{who are capable of}} loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.|$|E

50|$|Paying {{taxes is}} {{one way in which}} {{otherwise}} well-meaning people collaborate in injustice. People who proclaim that the war in Mexico is wrong and that it is wrong to enforce slavery contradict themselves if they fund both things by paying taxes. Thoreau points out that the same people who applaud soldiers for refusing to fight an unjust war are not <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> to refuse to fund the government that started the war.|$|R
60|$|The {{neighbouring}} {{district of}} Tanjore had {{at different times}} been visited, and the ministers of the Rajah had shown <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> to bestow some reflection on what they heard from the missionaries. Visits to this place and to Trichinopoly became frequent with him, and in 1766 the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge having decided on planting a mission station in the latter place, he was appointed to take the charge of it.|$|R
25|$|The {{delay in}} {{fertility}} becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak. Since fertility peaks {{at a certain}} age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women {{will be able to}} have children. The media has been an influence on women's fertility choices: popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{research}} into {{individual differences in}} female resistance to mate guarding. A recent study by Abell and Brewer (2016) has focused on machiavellianism. They found that women high in this trait {{are more likely to}} resist mate guarding attempts and use covert tactics to do so. They suggest that this reflects the characteristics of machivellianism – using glibness and manipulation to get what is wanted and it is argued that this is their way of controlling their partners. This is supported by the finding that females who are more controlling <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> use more mate guarding resistant tactics too.|$|E
25|$|AmeriCorps is {{a network}} of {{national}} service programs that engage more than 75,000Americans each year in intensive service to meet critical needs in education, public safety, health and the environment. Habitat for Humanity International {{was one of the}} first nonprofits contacted by the Corporation for National and Community Service when AmeriCorps was being formed in 1993. In the 2008–2009 program year, over 500AmeriCorps members at affiliates all over the country will help build nearly 2,000houses and recruit and retain nearly 200,000community volunteers. Those volunteers will provide an estimated 1,600,000volunteer hours. The members <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> contribute 850,000hours.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 6th century BC and {{continuing}} through the 5th and early 4th centuries, Sparta dominated the Peloponnese, and compelled its neighors to join its Peloponnesian League and fight in its wars. [...] This dominance naturally aroused anger amongst these neighboring states, and Sparta's allies proved <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> {{to rise up}} against their overlord on several occasions. [...] In 418 BC, Mantinea joined a league of Peloponnesian democratic states that briefly pursued an anti-Spartan policy before being defeated at the Battle of Mantinea (418 BC).|$|R

"Jack in the Green, {{with his}} mate, {{belonging}} to the wherry called the Jolly Raven, have done their duty faithfully by me, landing me at Greenwich by my express command; and being <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> and desirous to carry me on board the Royal Thistle, presently lying at Gravesend."

25|$|During design, planning, {{maintenance}} and construction, metric is used. As a result, (and anticipating that the roadsigns <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> {{one day be}} changed to display in metric units) recently erected signs are increasingly being placed at metric intervals but display an imperial unit {{as required by the}} current road-signage rules. For example, a 110yd marker might actually be placed at the 100m distance. Since 2008, location marker posts have appeared on motorways and major A roads in England, situated generally at intervals of 500 metres (though the dimension is not given). These repeat the information given on the co-sited surveyors' marker post which, since the 1960s, have reported distances on such roads in kilometres from a datum—usually the start of the road, or the planned start-point of the road.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of problems, waste {{products}} produced by dying cells or overgrowth of contaminants will cause a change in pH, leading {{to a change in}} indicator color. For example, a culture of relatively slowly dividing mammalian cells can be quickly overgrown by bacterial contamination. This usually results in an acidification of the medium, turning it yellow. Many biologists find this a convenient way to rapidly check on the health of tissue cultures. In addition, the waste products produced by the mammalian cells <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> slowly decrease the pH, gradually turning the solution orange and then yellow. This color change is an indication that {{even in the absence of}} contamination, the medium needs to be replaced (generally, this should be done before the medium has turned completely orange).|$|E
500|$|Persecution was not {{the only}} outlet of the Tetrarchy's moral fervor. In 295, either Diocletian or his Caesar (subordinate emperor), Galerius, issued an edict from Damascus proscribing incestuous marriages and affirming the {{supremacy}} of Roman law over local law. Its preamble insists that it is every emperor's duty to enforce the sacred precepts of Roman law, for [...] "the immortal gods <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> favour and be at peace with the Roman name...if we have seen to it that all subject to our rule entirely lead a pious, religious, peaceable and chaste life in every respect". These principles, if given their full extension, would logically require Roman emperors to enforce conformity in religion.|$|E

Unwilling to lose {{favor with}} her betrothed by {{publicly}} exposing his lie, Sansa claims she remembers nothing. Sick of the petty bickering, King Robert chastises his son for allowing {{himself to be}} disarmed by the younger girl and declares that the fathers <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> punish their respective children, dismissing the audience. However, Robert gives in to his wife Cersei's demands and orders the direwolf killed. Since Nymeria has fled, Sansa's wolf, Lady, is to be sacrificed. Unable to convince the king otherwise, Eddard takes responsibility for killing Sansa's pet himself. As {{he walks to the}} back of the inn, he encounters Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor [...] "The Hound" [...] Clegane, who has ridden down the butcher's boy and brought in his bloody corpse for the prince.|$|E

As Larry starts the playback {{of one of the}} DVDs, Sally discovers she can converse with the Doctor in the past, as he possesses a copy of the complete transcript that is currently being compiled by Larry as he listens. The Doctor explains that he and Martha were transported to 1969 by the Weeping Angels. The Angels are [...] "quantum locked", allowing them to move unbelievably fast when unobserved, while they turn to near-indestructible stone when they are observed. As gazing upon <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> permanently lock them in that form, the Angels otherwise cover their eyes, creating their [...] "weeping" [...] appearance. The Angels feed on the potential time energy generated when they transport their victims to the past, and the Doctor fears they are now seeking the TARDIS' vast reserves of time energy.|$|E

50|$|Whilst {{the various}} factions had {{struggled}} {{to gain some}} sort of unity the Scythe Cross movement had remained independent. The group pushed a strong platform of anti-Semitism and anti-communism and, drawing its support from the working classes, soon {{came to be seen}} as a potential danger by the government of Miklós Horthy. Support was particularly strong amongst the poor seasonal workers who picked up casual labour on the large estates at harvest time, and when over 100 were arrested they all declared <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> to die for the 'Idea' espoused by Böszörmény.|$|R
5000|$|Let priests remember, therefore, {{that the}} care of all churches must be their {{intimate}} concern. Hence, priests of such dioceses rich in vocations should show <b>themselves</b> <b>willing</b> and ready, {{with the permission of}} their own ordinaries, to volunteer for work in other regions, missions or endeavors which are poor in numbers of clergy. ... To accomplish this purpose there should be set up international seminaries ... by means of which, according to their particular statutes and always saving the right of bishops, priests may be trained and incardinated {{for the good of the}} whole Church.|$|R

The rear guard, of two companies of Ghoorkhas and two companies of Scottish Fusiliers, arrived late in the day. They had met with great opposition. The tribesmen would, indeed, have succeeded in carrying off the guns, had not a company of the Ghoorkhas come up and, fighting stubbornly, driven them off.|$|R
2500|$|If the photon gas is not Planckian, {{the second}} law of {{thermodynamics}} guarantees that interactions (between photons and other particles or even, at sufficiently high temperatures, between the photons <b>themselves)</b> <b>will</b> cause the photon energy distribution {{to change and}} approach the Planck distribution. [...] In such an approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with a Planck distribution until they reach the equilibrium temperature. It {{is as if the}} gas is a mixture of sub-gases, one for every band of wavelengths, and each sub-gas eventually attains the common temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entire body}} of Rats during the Ratline {{is called a}} [...] "Rat Mass." [...] Since Rats are not officially fourth classmen until after Breakout, the Rat Mass is also not officially {{considered}} a graduating class until that time either. Prior to Breakout, the Rat mass is given a different style of year identifier to emphasize this difference. The year identifier starts with {{the year of the}} current graduating class (their dykes' class), followed by a [...] "+3" [...] to indicate the anticipated year of their own class. For example, Rats that make up the Class of 2020 were considered the [...] "Rat Mass of 2017+3" [...] as the members of their dykes' class will graduate in 2017 and they <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> graduate three years onward from then.|$|E
2500|$|Open and Exclusive Brethren {{differ in}} how they {{interpret}} the concept of [...] "no clergy". The Open Brethren believe in a plurality of elders (Acts 14:23; 15:6,23; 20:17; Philippians 1:1), men meeting the Biblical qualifications found in 1 Timothy 3:1–7 and Titus 1:6–9. This position is also taken in some Baptist churches, especially Reformed Baptists, and by the Churches of Christ. It is understood that elders are appointed by the Holy Spirit (...) and are recognised as meeting the qualifications by the assembly and by previously existing elders. Generally, the elders <b>themselves</b> <b>will</b> look out for men who meet the biblical qualifications, and invite them to join them as elders. In some Open assemblies, elders are elected democratically, {{but this is a}} fairly recent development and is still relatively uncommon.|$|E
