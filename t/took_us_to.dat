500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames {{franchise}} history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. [...] "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been there a long time. It was time for him. He <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well." [...] Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.|$|E
500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were named}} 2012 inductees for the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. In an {{interview}} that same day, Anthony Kiedis talked about Frusciante and if he would attend the ceremony. Kiedis stated, [...] "It would be a guess on my behalf {{on whether or not}} he’ll come. I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E

Whatever platforms that <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to,</b> he was ready to go. He wasn't protective at all. He was wide open. I think that was great." ...|$|E

In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrien Jones, the {{president}} of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, said, [...] "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Mornington Straddle, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there.... It was a family secret for 600 years and even Mr. Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict said, [...] "The {{direction}} is sometimes uncertain, but Highlander: The Series gives viewers something unique and inspiring. Each episode {{gives us a}} provocative glimpse into the trials and concerns of immortality, great swordfights, stylish flashbacks to bygone eras, and occasionally wicked immortals with awesome quickenings." [...] Lineberger added, [...] "These actors, writers, producers, directors, and crew delivered one of television's great successes, particularly in the fantasy genre. Highlander: The Series <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> places we otherwise could not have gone, and did so with intelligence, style, and wit." [...] Lineberger gave the six seasons scores of 92, 93, 90, 92, 87, and 70 out of 100, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} premiere a less {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} C+ grade. She said [...] "Unlike other seasons, which <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> places like Wonderland and Neverland and Oz, Arendelle {{does not have a}} massive, mythic past to draw from. There are no crocodiles with clocks in their stomachs, or literary silver slippers (to contrast with cinematic ruby ones), or tiny bottles that say “drink me.” Instead, basically, there is one movie. A massive, record-breaking blockbuster, to be sure, but a single screen outing does not produce a relatively rich mythology from which to pull. [...] If the season four premiere (and all the promos for it) is any indication, this season will be Frozen-centric, and story supply is already running low. They already blew up the evil snowman, for God’s sake (although I guess Elsa could just conjure up another one)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{expelled}} was {{the family}} of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover {{on the night of}} 27 October 1938: [...] "Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: Juden raus! Auf nach Palästina!" [...] ("Jews out, out to Palestine!"). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family's expulsion: [...] "No one told us what was up, but we realised {{this was going to be}} the end ... We haven't a penny. Could you send us something?" [...] He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the failure}} of the referendum, the Colombian {{government}} and the FARC, on November 24, signed a revised agreement. Colombia’s congress approved the revised peace accord. It was then submitted to Congress for approval. On 29 November, the Senate approved the deal 75-0 and the House of Representatives approved it the next day by a vote of 130-0 despite former President Alvaro Uribe's supporters boycotting the session. Santos welcomed the resolution, while Sergio Jaramillo, the government’s peace commissioner, said: [...] "This last part of renegotiation was exhausting. It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the limit. But now we pass to something more difficult, which is to change the conditions on the ground and benefit our campesinos. And to assure there is safe transit for the FARC and to worry about the security of communities. [...] no more political deaths in Colombia." [...] Uribe's supporters accused the government of giving away too many rights, including FARC's ability to form a political party. The deal now means FARC members were go to designated transitional zones within five days and hand over its weapons to the United Nations representatives within the next six months. They would also be able to form a political party.|$|E

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
