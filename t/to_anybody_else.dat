Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing fellatio on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so {{that he does not}} say anything <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> He even asks Finn to a Yankees game, which Finn does not attend. Finn soon quits the job out of fear.|$|E
25|$|Some days later, Bhim Chand sent {{a message}} to Anandpur, asking the Guru to lend the Prasadi {{elephant}} to him. Bhim Chand wanted the elephant to make a display of his wealth to the guests at his son's proposed wedding. The Guru suspected that Bhim Chand wanted to gain permanent possession of the elephant, and declined the Raja's demand. He stated that the devotee who had presented the elephant didn't want it to be given away <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> Bhim Chand is said to have sent his emissaries thrice to the Guru, the last one being Raja Kesari Chand of Jaswal. However, the Guru didn't accept his demand, and refused to part with the elephant.|$|E
500|$|On 1 August 1938, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Ismay became the Committee's Secretary and began planning for the impending war. In May 1940, when Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he selected Ismay as his chief military assistant and staff officer. In that capacity, Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Ismay also accompanied Churchill to many of the Allied war conferences. For Ismay's advice and aid, [...] "Churchill owed more, and admitted that he owed more" [...] to him [...] "than <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else,</b> military or civilian, in the whole of the war." ...|$|E

[...] "I never wanted <b>to</b> know <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> I never cared <b>to</b> see <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> I {{never would have}} gone out in this way but for you," [...] she said hurriedly. After a pause she added in a frightened tone: [...] "That didn't sound like your voice then. It didn't sound like it a moment ago either." ...|$|R
500|$|An {{academician}} from Taiyuan, {{referred to}} {{only by his}} surname Wang, chances upon a homeless girl who claims to be an ill-treated concubine. Noting her beauty, as well as feeling pity for her, Wang agrees to let her stay at his residence temporarily. They make love at his study, unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> A few days afterwards, Wang's spouse, Chen, discovers their affair and is unhappy with the arrangement, but fails at changing his mind. At the marketplace, a Taoist priest informs Wang {{that he has been}} possessed by an evil spirit. Wang dismisses this with incredulity. He returns home but finds the gates locked. Nevertheless, he manages to find a way into the courtyard and notices that the front door is bolted too. Peeking through the window, Wang makes a startling discovery − the girl is actually a [...] "green-faced monster, a ghoul with great jagged teeth like a saw." [...] All this while, she had been wearing a mask made of human skin, on which her attractive features were painted.|$|E
500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen to everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think all that stuff shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E

As Ahmed Kasim reports to Bronowsky, [...] "She begins first, finishes last and has two drinks <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> one. Also ... her behavior is erratic."

2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I think that that is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once, the Nawab of Junagadh {{heard the}} music of Premanand Swami at the Swaminarayan Mandir. He felt, “Such singing from {{the depth of the}} soul is not {{possible}} anywhere in the world.” Some time later some musicians from Gwalior came to sing the drupad rag before the Nawab. He told them, ‘‘After listening to Premanand, a sadhu of Swaminarayan, I no longer listen <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else’s</b> music. His singing is matchless in this world.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dreamed that}} the ticket the man gave {{me for my}} legs was No. 19, and I was worried all through the {{performance}} for fear No. 61 should get hold of them, and leave me his instead. Mine are rather a fine pair of legs, and I am, I confess, a little proud of them--at all events, I prefer them <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else's.</b> Besides, number sixty-one's might be a skinny pair, and not fit me.|$|R
