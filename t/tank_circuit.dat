The primary tuned circuit serves as the <b>tank</b> <b>circuit</b> of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices instead of transistors {{because they are more}} robust and tolerant of overloads.

25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series <b>tank</b> <b>circuit</b> with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E

2500|$|The ferroresonant transformer, ferroresonant {{regulator}} or constant-voltage transformer {{is a type}} of saturating transformer used as {{a voltage}} regulator. These transformers use a <b>tank</b> <b>circuit</b> composed of a high-voltage resonant winding and a capacitor to produce a nearly constant average output voltage with a varying input current or varying load.

2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary <b>tank</b> <b>circuit,</b> a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage capacitor, spark gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or [...] "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{has drawn}} significant interest for {{its potential to}} power autonomous low-power applications. Vibration energy harvesting is particularly well suited to industrial condition sensing, environmental monitoring and household environments where low-level vibrations are commonly found. While significant {{progress has been made}} in making vibration harvesters more efficient, most designs are still based on a single constant vibration frequency. However, most vibration sources do not have a constant frequency nor a single harmonic. Therefore, the inability to deal with non-ideal vibration sources has become a major technological obstacle for vibration energy harvesters to be widely applicable. To advance the state of vibration energy harvesting, this thesis presents a design methodology that is capable of dealing with two major non-ideal vibration characteristics: single harmonic frequency shifting and multi-frequency/broadband excitation. This methodology includes a broad-band impedance matching theory and a power electronics architecture to implement that theory. The generalized impedance matching theory extends the well known single frequency impedance matching model to a multi-frequency impedance matching model. By connecting LC <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> to the harvester output, additional resonant frequencies are created thereby enabling the energy harvesting system to effectively harvest energy from multi-harmonic vibration sources. However, the required inductors in the LC <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> are often too large (> 10 H) to be implemented with discrete components. The power electronics proposed here addresses this issue by synthesizing the <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> with a power factor correction (PFC) circuit. This circuit mainly consists of an H-bridge, which contains four FETs, and a control loop that turns the FETs on and off at the right time such that the load voltage and current display the characteristics of the multiple <b>tank</b> <b>circuits.</b> By using this proposed power electronics, we demonstrate dual-frequency energy harvesting from a single mechanically resonant harvester. Simulation and experimental results match well and demonstrate that the proposed power electronics is capable of implementing higher order multi-resonant energy harvesting systems. In conclusion, this thesis presents both a theoretical foundation and a power electronics architecture that enables simultaneous effective multi-frequency energy harvesting with a single mechanically resonant harvester. The tunability of the power electronics also provides the possibility of dynamic real-time tuning which is useful to track non-stationary vibration sources. by Samuel C. Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)
