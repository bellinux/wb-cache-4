40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the results of the curatorship and analysis of ceramics from Rosário Archaeological Site, situated in Guaíra, state of São Paulo. We sought to relate the elements of archaeological culture with the physical aspects of the environment present in such archeological landscape. The research aimed to understand the relation between the elements of the archaeological culture and the landscape, unit of study comprehended through the dialectical relation between natural elements and humans. Thus, analyzing the ceramics <b>through</b> <b>operational</b> chain and <b>study</b> of the landscape, we add contributions to the knowledge of the past occupations in the North of São Paulo State. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a {{methodology}} for intelligent monitoring of marine machinery using performance data. Monitoring of machinery condition is a crucial aspect of maintenance optimisation that {{is required for the}} vessel operation to remain sustainable and profitable. The proposed methodology will train models pertinent to specific machinery components using pre-classified performance data and then classify new data points using the models developed. For this, measurements are suitably analysed and processed to retain most of the information (variance) of the original dataset while minimising number of required dimensions. Finally, new data are compared against the models developed to evaluate their condition. The above will provide a flexible but robust framework for the early detection of emerging machinery faults. This will lead to minimisation of ship downtime and increase of the ship’s operability and income <b>through</b> <b>operational</b> enhancement. Case <b>studies</b> that show initial results obtained through main engine data are included...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the study shed new {{insights}} about how hospitals can implement operational innovation to improve their operations, QM practice and eventually organizational performance. The findings of the study revealed that process improvement and medical IT systems as part of operational innovation are associated with improved quality improvement (. 291) and improved safety practices (. 281). This result seems reasonable in that all of the efforts to improve quality improvement and safety practices are related to engagements and attitudes of medical staff <b>through</b> <b>operational</b> innovation. The <b>study</b> indicated that quality improvement (. 798) and safety practices (. 330) as part of QM practices are associated with organizational performance. Since employees are the direct contact point with customers, they directly affect quality of care service. Thus, these results indicate that the effectiveness of QM practices are important to patient satisfaction [32, 43]. This seems to be reasonable given that all of the efforts to improve quality of care service and safety are important for organizational performance. Thus, it is critical for healthcare organizations to develop and undertake operational innovations in their existing work systems and processes to improve employees’ task efficiency for QM practices and organizational performance.|$|R
