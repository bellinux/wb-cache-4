5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 tickets. The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 tickets would be offered, {{for sale to}} the public, while the remaining 3,000 were sold to other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> more than the original price, in order to prevent some football hooligans from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this and insisted that <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of <b>the</b> <b>tickets.</b> To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a new network service, the “ticket server”. This service provides “tickets ” that a client can attach {{to a request}} for a network service (such as sending email or asking for a stock quote). The recipient of such a request (such as the email recipient or the stockbroker) can use the ticker server to verify that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is valid and that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> hasn’t been used before. Clients can acquire tickets ahead of time, independently of the particular network service request. Clients can maintain their stock of tickets either on their own storage, or as a balance recorded by <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server. Recipients of a request can tell <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server to refund <b>the</b> attached <b>ticket</b> to <b>the</b> original client, thus incrementing the client’s balance at <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server. For example, an email recipient might do this if the email wasn’t spam. This paper describes the functions of <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server, defines a cryptographic protocol for <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server’s operations, and outlines an efficient implementation for <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Knowledge {{of writing}} and of terms: If the {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> {{knew that there was}} writing on <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> and also knew that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> contained terms, then the recipient is bound by the terms of the contract.|$|R
5|$|At the Flophouse, a wild celebration takes place. Fauna, {{at first}} in the costume of a witch, seems to {{transform}} her costume into that of a Fairy Godmother. After some sleight of hand with <b>the</b> <b>tickets,</b> Doc wins the raffle, {{to the surprise of}} some. When Suzy comes out in a white bride's dress and sings her lines, Doc is unimpressed, and Suzy is humiliated. As both stalk off in opposite directions, the party disintegrates into a brawl.|$|E
5|$|During {{its opening}} {{weekend at the}} Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis, Into Temptation sold more tickets in three days than any other film during its debut weekend, and sold twice <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> of such major studio films as Taking Woodstock and Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. This {{resulted}} in an extended run and strong word-of-mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities. The film earned a total of $97,457 in gross revenue in the United States. The Into Temptation DVD was released on October 27, 2009, with no bonus features.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the tour, all <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> made available for the shows sold out, which prompted more dates {{to be added to the}} itinerary. The tour grossed $188.6 million in 2013 and the 2014 shows grossed $41.1 million, bringing the tour's total gross revenue to $229.7 million. This made The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour the highest-grossing female and solo tour of 2013, and one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. Performances of numerous songs from the tour were broadcast and behind-the-scenes footage was released.|$|E
50|$|Ability to view <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is {{important}} to both the service provider {{and the owner of}} <b>the</b> <b>ticket.</b> <b>The</b> owner needs to know what his ticket actually is and the service provider needs to verify <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> during redemption. <b>The</b> view could be achieved by properly designed hardware.|$|R
50|$|Accessible toilets are {{available}} on platform 1, next to <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office, and can be unlocked on request by asking staff in <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office. Sheltered seating is provided on platform 1 in both <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office and <b>the</b> same shelter that houses <b>the</b> self-service <b>ticket</b> machine whilst open-air seating is available on platform 2.|$|R
50|$|However, the housemate {{will only}} have <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> {{as long as}} no other secret is disclosed. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> will be going over until {{a certain point in}} the series where the owner will have <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> for good and be a finalist.|$|R
5|$|Pearl Jam {{was outraged}} when it {{discovered}} after {{a pair of}} shows in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994 that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to <b>the</b> <b>tickets.</b> Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that accused them of being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band's intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam's plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled {{as a result of}} a Ticketmaster boycott.|$|E
5|$|The Glastonbury Festival 2011 {{took place}} from Wednesday 22 until Sunday 26 June 2011. <b>The</b> <b>tickets</b> were sold out within 4 hours {{of going on}} sale on Sunday 3 October 2010. Headline acts for 2011 were U2 on the Friday night, Coldplay on the Saturday and Beyoncé on Sunday. This made Beyoncé {{the first woman to}} {{headline}} at the festival since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The race {{is widely}} {{considered}} the greatest performance {{of the twentieth century}} by a North American racehorse. Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years. Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).|$|E
50|$|A pull-tab is a {{gambling}} ticket that is {{sold as a}} means to play a pull-tab game. The object of <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is to open the perforated windows on the back of <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> and match <b>the</b> symbols inside <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> to <b>the</b> winning combinations on the front of <b>the</b> <b>ticket.</b> <b>The</b> winning Pull-Tab <b>ticket</b> is turned in for a monetary prize. Other names for it include Break-Opens, Nevada Tickets, Cherry Bells, Lucky 7s, Pickle Cards, Instant Bingo, Bowl Games, or Popp-Opens (Arrow International trademark).|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the purpose}} of <b>the</b> <b>ticket,</b> it may be {{transfer}}red. During the transfer process, <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> should be visible to both parties involved. After the transfer process is done, <b>the</b> ownership of <b>ticket</b> has changed. <b>The</b> history of transfer should be recorded in either <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> itself or <b>the</b> central database.|$|R
50|$|Often, <b>the</b> paper bus <b>ticket</b> {{is used as}} an {{advertising}} space. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> rolls for <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> machines are pre-printed on the rear with a particular company's advert.|$|R
5|$|Aagadu was {{released}} in 100 screens across countries like Australia, United Kingdom, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, etc. The premieres in United States were held on 18 September 2014. The advance booking commenced on 15 September 2014 and almost half of <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> for all the shows on the release day were booked in three days. It also had a record release of 110 screens across North India, and was screened at 6:00 AM in fifteen selected screens across Hyderabad on the release day. Aagadu was dubbed into Hindi as Encounter Shankar, and into Tamil as Idhudhaanda Police.|$|E
5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group is locked up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the lock on the door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up in the locker room where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before the Final, a block of 1,600 tickets in the Liverpool supporters' seating area was stolen in the postal system. The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> on crowd safety grounds, and threatened to eject anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving stolen goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> hall {{houses a}} retail unit {{as well as}} {{self-service}} <b>ticket</b> machines. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> office has three serving positions.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> {{office is}} at surface level. There is one {{automated}} ticket machine, which {{is next to}} <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> booth has a hipped {{corrugated}} steel sheeted roof supported on a timbered framed building and clad with chamber board wall. Steel mesh secures <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> box opening counter. Most of the turnstiles {{have been removed}} with only three remaining turnstiles located adjoining <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> booth.|$|R
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. <b>The</b> <b>tickets</b> assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} funerals, he {{travelled}} to Amsterdam with Mugford and a friend, where {{he bought a}} large quantity of cannabis; the travel agent who sold <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> said the group had been in high spirits. Bamber also began selling his family's belongings; Mugford's mother was offered June's car and an ad {{was placed in a}} local newspaper asking ₤900 for Nevill's. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Bamber tried to sell 20 nude photographs of Sheila for ₤20,000 to The Sun, and went on another overseas trip with a friend, Brent, this time to Saint-Tropez.|$|E
5|$|The 79th Annual Wee Waa Show, held on 17 May 2013 in {{the rural}} Australian town of Wee Waa, was {{selected}} as the venue for the worldwide album launch. <b>The</b> <b>tickets</b> for the Wee Waa album launch were completely sold within thirteen minutes of release, even though it was widely understood that Daft Punk would not be in attendance at the launch—the album launch details revealed that the album would be streamed live to the 4,000 audience members. Australian police in the local Wee Waa area initiated Operation Hadrian to prevent alcohol-related problems and anti-social behaviour at the launch event.|$|E
50|$|There are {{elevators}} between {{ground level}} and <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> gate level and between <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> gate level and platform level. There are also escalators between <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> gate level and platform level. Along with multifunction toilets, these facilities {{are meant to}} make the station barrier free.|$|R
50|$|Two {{guys have}} <b>the</b> winning <b>ticket</b> in a lottery, but <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is {{taken by a}} woman robbing the {{restaurant}} they're in, who swallows <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> before getting arrested. The guys {{come up with a}} scheme to recover <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> by committing a felony while impersonating women so as to be sent to the same women's penitentiary as the robber.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> {{system is}} closed, {{which means that}} {{validation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is required when entering the station and again when exiting.|$|R
5|$|The Moonshine Jungle Tour {{was officially}} {{announced}} on February 10, 2013, after Mars {{performance at the}} 55th Annual Grammy Awards, by William Morris Endeavor (WME). Instead of announcing everything together and sales later on the same week, WME decided to reveal the shows in an unconventional way. Consequently, {{two days after the}} Grammy's performance, the cities were unveiled. A couple of days later the dates and venues were announced. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> were made available two-and-a-half weeks later after the cities were disclosed. A promotional trailer and behind-the-scenes footage of the tour were released through Mars' official YouTube channel and website to further promote the tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} bookings {{for the film}} opened, a {{reported}} crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. <b>The</b> <b>tickets,</b> the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, {{to the extent that}} police intervention was required. It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|The eighth {{event in}} the Bound for Glory {{chronology}} was first announced on June 10, 2012 at the Slammiversary PPV to around the weekend where Sting would be formally inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. Late June, TNA President Dixie Carter stated via Twitter that Bound for Glory would {{take place in a}} city not yet visited by the company and be revealed during the telecast of the July 5 edition of Impact Wrestling. During the show, an official video announcement confirmed the event would transpire at the Grand Canyon University Arena in Phoenix, Arizona on October 14, 2012. Before <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> went on sale on July 27, 2012, Rob Van Dam promoted the event and signed autographs during a pre-sale session at the GCU Arena Box Office the day prior.|$|E
50|$|A {{paper ticket}} often is {{perforated}} {{so it can}} be separated into two parts, one (<b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> stub) to be kept by the customer, and one to be kept by <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> controller. Whether or not one can leave and reenter with the customer part only varies. It may not be allowed to avoid subsequent use of one ticket by multiple people, or even simultaneous use by giving <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> to someone before <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> check (if this is physically possible), but it may also be allowed, ex: in a movie theatre to buy, during a movie, a snack or drink before <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> check and reenter.|$|R
