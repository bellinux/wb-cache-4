We experimentally study the effect of modifying the flaperon, which is a high speed aileron between the inboard and outboard flaps, at both approach and <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions</b> using scaled models in a free jet. The flaperon modifications were of two types: sawtooth trailing edge and mini vortex generators (vg s). Parametric variations of these two concepts were tested with a round coaxial nozzle and an advanced chevron nozzle, with azimuthally varying fan chevrons, using both far field microphone arrays and phased microphone arrays for source diagnostics purposes. In general, the phased array results corroborated the far field results in the upstream quadrant pointing to JFI near the flaperon trailing edge as the origin of the far field noise changes. Specific sawtooth trailing edges in conjunction with the round nozzle gave marginal reduction in JFI noise at approach, and parallel co-rotating mini-vg s were somewhat more beneficial over a wider range of angles, but both concepts were noisier at <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> These two concepts had generally an adverse JFI effect when used in conjunction with the advanced chevron nozzle at both approach and <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

Additional combustor performance characteristics, including lean blowout, exit temperature pattern factor and radial profile, pressure loss, altitude stability, and altitude relight characteristics were documented.

The acoustic analysis {{has been carried}} out with a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings code over one rotor revolution with a resolution of 360 time steps. To ensure covering of all sources while keeping numerical losses low different hull surfaces have been examined. The comparison of two configurations at differ-ent flight conditions shows two main noise generating effects: the single rotor emission and emission caused by interaction of the rotors. The single rotor emission can mostly be seen in the rotor plane whereas the interaction can be examined at an angle of 20 to 45 and 135 to 155 degrees to the rotating axis with approx-imately the same share of total noise in <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> In cruise conditions the single rotor emission prevails over the in-teraction. This {{can be explained by the}} transonic blade tip speeds during cruise. Due to the reduced tip speeds in take-off interac-tion noise contributes to the total noise with a higher share than in cruise conditions.

40|$|Propulsion {{airframe}} aeroacoustic (PAA) interactions, {{resulting from}} the integration of engine and airframe, lead to azimuthal asymmetries in the flow/acoustic field, e. g., due to {{the interaction between the}} exhaust jet flow and the pylon, the wing and its high-lift devices, such as, flaps and flaperons. In the first two parts of this series we have presented experimental results which show that isolated and installed nozzles with azimuthally varying chevrons (AVCs) can reduce noise more than conventional chevrons when integrated with a pylon and a wing with flaps at <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this paper, we present model-scale experimental results for the reduction of jet-flap interaction noise source due to these AVCs and document the PAA installation effects (difference in noise between installed and isolated nozzle configurations) at both approach and <b>take-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> It is found that the installation effects of both types of chevron nozzles, AVCs and conventional, are reversed at approach and take-off, in that there is more installed noise reduction at approach and less at take-off compared to that of the isolated nozzles. Moreover, certain AVCs give larger total installed noise benefits at both conditions compared to conventional chevrons. Phased microphone array results show that at approach conditions (large flap deflection, low jet speed and low ambient Mach number), chevrons gain more noise benefit from reducing jetflap interaction noise than they do from quieting the jet plume noise source which is already weak at these low jet speeds. In contrast, at take-off (small flap deflection, high jet speed and high ambient Mach number) chevrons reduce the dominant jet plume noise better than the reduction they create in jet-flap interaction noise source. In addition, fan AVCs with enhanced mixing near the pylon are found to reduce jet-flap interaction noise better than conventional chevrons at take-off...|$|E

The analysis, based on a simple momentum balance consideration, permits the computation of inlet pressure recovery - mass-flow relations and additive-drag coefficients for forward velocities from zero to the speed of sound. The penalties for operation of a sharp-lip inlet at velocity ratios other than 1. 0 may be severe; at lower velocity ratios an additive drag is incurred that is not cancelled by lip suction, while at higher velocity ratios, unavoidable losses in inlet total pressure will result. In particular, at the <b>take-off</b> <b>condition,</b> the total pressure and the mass flow for a choked inlet are only 79 percent of the values ideally attainable with a rounded lip.

The experimental investigation indicated that total-pressure recoveries comparable withose attainable with well designed nose inlets were obtained with the side inlets when all the boundary layer ahead of the inlets was removed.

40|$|A multi-disciplinary {{analysis}} and optimization {{is carried out}} for a propeller in a real pusher aircraft configuration {{with the goal of}} reducing the radiated noise power levels, while preserving the aerodynamic efficiency. The optimization process involves the shape of the blade and the position of the engine exhaust ducts. A coupling of the unsteady aerodynamic and structural-dynamic blade models provides the aeroaelastic propeller model that drives a tonal and broadband aeroacoustic prediction. The tonal noise results from the periodic flow unsteadiness due to the non-axial flight and to the impingement of the engine exhausts on the propeller disk. The broadband noise is mainly due to the interaction between the blade leading-edge and the exhaust turbulence. It is shown that the tonal noise overwhelms the broadband noise, and that the optimization affects the shape of the blade at the tip and in the spanwise segment hit by the exhausts.
