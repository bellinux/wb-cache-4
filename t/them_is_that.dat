5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{hypothesis}} as to how Ithaca Chasma formed. One of <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it formed as Tethys' internal liquid water ocean solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking its surface to accommodate the extra volume within. Earlier craters made before Tethys solidified were probably all erased by geological activity before then.|$|E

25|$|When {{the commanders}} had fled the scene, Scottish mercenaries {{overwhelmed}} the German artillery, seized {{the guns and}} took aim at the German cavalry. The German cavalry charged, hit by Scottish artillery fire on their way, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and 1,500 dead Scots. The German and Swedish infantry stood by without taking action, neither did the Scottish cavalry intervene. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record of <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were subsequently brought to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though {{we know that the}} only thing implied about <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E

25|$|Around April 1906 he met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 {{years younger}} than Matisse. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key {{difference}} between <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and still life, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas. During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris—Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein and Michael's wife Sarah—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition Gertrude Stein's two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|The {{next six}} {{elements}} on {{the periodic table}} should be the last six main-group elements {{before the end of}} the periodic table at Z = 173. In elements 167 to 172, the 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 shells will be filled. Their energy eigenvalues are so close together that they behave as one combined p shell, similar to the non-relativistic 2p and 3p shells. Thus, the inert pair effect does not occur and the most common oxidation states of elements 167 to 170 should be +3, +4, +5, and +6 respectively. Element 171 (unseptunium) is expected to show some similarities to the halogens, showing various oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7, although its physical properties should be closer to that of a metal. Its electron affinity should be 3.0eV, allowing it to form HUsu, analogous to a hydrogen halide. The Usu− ion is expected to be a soft base, comparable to iodide (I−). Element 172 (unseptbium) should be a noble gas with chemical behaviour similar to that of xenon, as their ionization energies should be very similar (Xe, 1170.4kJ/mol; , 1090.3kJ/mol). The only main difference between <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> element 172, unlike xenon, is expected to be a liquid or a solid at standard temperature and pressure due to its much higher atomic weight. Unseptbium should be a strong Lewis acid, forming fluorides and oxides, similarly to its lighter congener xenon. Because of this analogy of elements 165–172 to periods 2 and 3, Fricke et al. considered them to form a ninth period of the periodic table, while the eighth period was taken by them to end at the noble metal element 164. This ninth and final period would be similar to the second and third period in that it should have no transition metals.|$|E

500|$|Orci's first credit solely as a {{producer}} came with the film Eagle Eye, where he worked once again alongside Kurtzman. He {{said in an interview}} with the magazine Extra that he had previously been involved in productions where the producers had writing backgrounds and had looked to them for help, and he was happy to provide that same support to the writers on Eagle Eye. The director of the film, D. J. Caruso, praised the duo saying that [...] "What's unusually cool about <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they have maintained the producer-writer power that they earned in television and carried that over into the feature film area, and that is extremely rare." [...] Following their work on Eagle Eye, they were executive producers on the Sandra Bullock film, The Proposal.|$|E
500|$|There are two German {{statues of}} saints in wood, about half life-size, from the decades around 1500, {{and a larger}} number of {{miniature}} boxwood carvings. [...] These include [...] "prayer nuts" [...] of superb quality from around 1510 to 1530. These are small wooden [...] "balls" [...] which open up to reveal carvings of religious scenes that fit dozens of tiny figures into a space two or three inches across, and were a fashion among royalty and the wealthy; they were apparently made in the northern Netherlands. [...] They seem to have often been suspended from belts, or formed part of a rosary; others still have copper carrying cases. [...] A trick of technique in making <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the main carved scene is made on a smaller hemisphere, allowing access from behind, which was then set into the main hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|Although Exton was [...] "clearly a {{partisan}} figure" [...] {{in the politics}} of London, his most recent biographer has noted that he [...] "nevertheless belonged to a ruling oligarchy whose shared interests often made it a force for stability" [...] in those politics. In any case, he managed to negotiate a difficult political period with little harm coming to him or the city under his mayorality, even though this involved allying with both the crown and its opponents against the other on varying occasions. Paul Strohm has suggested that, although Exton is often viewed as being politically sympathetic towards Brembre's views, Strohm says the difference between <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Exton was [...] "an honest and aboveboard player who did not scruple to expose his predecessor's hyperpartisan chicanery" [...] whose policies were much the same but lacking the [...] "criminal excesses" [...] of Brembre. Sumption, meanwhile, has summed up the Mayor as an [...] "astute trimmer whose main objective was to stay out of trouble," [...] whereas an earlier biographer believed that Exton remained loyal to the King, but was unable to go against the general feeling of his compatriots. Either way, Exton's policy was clearly one of non-alignment.|$|E
500|$|Musically {{the song}} is {{inspired}} by the 1980s. Essentially a club anthem, the song finds Madonna singing in her lower register. It incorporates the techno music played in the clubs of Ibiza. The song is set in common time with moderately fast dance groove tempo and a metronome of 126 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major. Madonna's voice spans from D3 to A4. It follows in the chord progression of E–D–C–D in the verses, and C–D–E in the chorus, with an E synth drone playing continually. Lyrically the song talks about empowerment and the urge to move on. It also reflected Madonna's change of style from her previous singles and shifting her focus on self-sufficiency. The line [...] "I can make it alone" [...] in the song demonstrated the shift. The lyrics of [...] "Jump" [...] have been compared to the lyrics of Madonna's 1990 song [...] "Keep It Together" [...] from the Like a Prayer album. The difference between <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Jump" [...] focuses more on the potentials of finding new love rather than family values.|$|E

It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December in the UK. Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK's bestselling books, and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas bestsellers in any category.
