25|$|The {{ship was}} built in 1943–44 as yard number 570 by P. Smit, Jr. Shipyard, Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands. Originally {{intended}} to be the trawler Mannheim for the Nordsee Deutsche Hochseefischerei, Wesermünde, she was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as Externsteine. She was launched in 1944, and completed in July of that year. The ship was originally named for the unusual Externsteine rock formation investigated by Heinrich Himmler for evidence of cultural significance to early Teutonic folklore and history. Externsteine had <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> WBS 11. Her complement was nineteen crew plus eleven meteorologists. She was employed as a weather observation ship off Shannon Island on the northeast coast of Greenland to aid forecasting of storm events tactically significant to North Atlantic and European combat operations, but was captured {{on the night of}} 15 October16 October 1944 by the American icebreaker USCGC Eastwind.|$|E

25|$|Based on this work, Dayhoff and her {{coworkers}} {{developed a}} set of substitution matrices called the PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation), MDM (Mutation Data Matrix), or Dayhoff. They are derived from global alignments of closely related protein sequences. <b>The</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> included with the matrix (ex. PAM40, PAM100) refers to the evolutionary distance; greater numbers correspond to greater distances. Matrices using greater evolutionary distances are extrapolated from those used for lesser ones. To produce a Dayhoff matrix, pairs of aligned amino acids in verified alignments are used to build a count matrix, which is then used to estimate at mutation matrix at 1 PAM (considered an evolutionary unit). From this mutation matrix, a Dayhoff scoring matrix may be constructed. Along with a model of indel events, alignments generated by these methods {{can be used in}} an iterative process to construct new count matrices until convergence.|$|E

She then made her way to San Francisco, and eventually to the east coast. Princess Matoika was the last ex-German ship to be commissioned.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{is legally}} {{protected}} and, in Italy, exclusive control is exercised over the cheese's production and sale by the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Consorzio, {{which was created}} by a governmental decree. Each wheel must meet strict criteria early in the aging process, when the cheese is still soft and creamy, to merit the official seal and be placed in storage for aging. Because it is widely imitated, Parmigiano-Reggiano has become an increasingly regulated product, and in 1955 it became {{what is known as}} a certified name (which {{is not the same as}} a brand name). In 2008, an EU court determined that the name [...] "Parmesan" [...] in Europe only refers to Parmigiano-Reggiano and cannot be used for imitation Parmesan.
