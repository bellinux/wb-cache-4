40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the effects of apple polyphenols (APs) on hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, hepatic steatosis and endothelial function and investigated the potential mechanisms. ApoE−/− mice were fed a western-type diet and orally treated with APs (100 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in the aortic sinuses and, and hepatic lipidosis were measured. <b>The</b> treatment with <b>APs</b> or atorvastatin induced a remarkable reduction in the atherosclerotic lesions and hepatic steatosis and decreased the levels of low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, CCL- 2 and VCAM- 1 levels in the plasma. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> significantly increased <b>the</b> plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and markedly up-regulated the glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in liver tissues. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> treatment modulated lipid metabolism by up-regulating the transcription of associated hepatic genes including PPARα, while down-regulating the transcription of SCAP and its downstream genes associated with lipid synthesis in the liver. Histological assessment showed that <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> treatment also reduced the macrophage infiltration in the aortic root plaque and the inflammatory cells infiltrations to the liver tissues. Moreover, we confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> treatment greatly reduced the ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction and monocyte adhesion to rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Mechanistically, <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> treatment suppressed <b>the</b> ROS/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, and consequently, reduced CCL- 2, ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression.

30|$|The design {{principle}} behind PowerNap is {{the transmission}} of one AP minimally interferes with {{the transmission of}} another, and each AP gets its weighted fair share for the media access. <b>The</b> <b>APs</b> will be staggered throughout the transmission round for this purpose. The distributed nature of the algorithm assists <b>the</b> <b>APs</b> to minimize computational latency.|$|R
30|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} time division-based medium-access mechanism in WLANs, our medium-access mechanism for ZFBF {{is based on}} both time and the remaining DoF of APs/transmitters. It is worthwhile to note that, instead {{of dealing with the}} total available DoF of <b>the</b> <b>APs,</b> we deal with the remaining DoF of <b>the</b> <b>APs.</b> <b>The</b> obvious reason is that ZF precoding loses as many DoFs as the number of antennas where interference cancellation is done.|$|R
