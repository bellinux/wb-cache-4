When <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> were revised in the early 1980s, <b>the</b> new <b>discussions</b> dealt with <b>the</b> apostasy less conspicuously, and in later discussions, rather than in <b>the</b> first <b>discussion.</b> <b>The</b> <b>discussions</b> also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} Friendship Is Magic posts drew {{attention}} on the site.

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left <b>the</b> <b>discussion.</b> The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> in {{this article}} has focused on one style or {{tradition}} of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E
