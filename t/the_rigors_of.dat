Bathilde is charmed with Giselle's sweet and demure nature, not knowing of her relationship with Albrecht. Giselle is honored when the beautiful stranger offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.|$|E

5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> the oncoming winter.|$|E

25|$|Japanese American culture places {{great value}} on {{education}} and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with {{a strong desire to}} enter <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> higher education. Because of such widespread ambition among members of the Japanese American community, math and reading scores on the SAT and ACT may often exceed the national averages. Japanese Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide Advanced Placement testing each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} at Taos originally had few windows and no standard doorways. Instead, access to rooms was through square {{holes in the}} roof that the people reached by climbing long, wooden ladders. Cedar logs (or vigas) supported roofs that had layers of branches, grass, mud, and plaster covering them.

40|$|Given {{the nature}} of {{investigating}} bilingual mathematics learners and learning environments, a key concern is how we can ensure that <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> <b>of</b> our research is matched by <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> <b>of</b> methodological frameworks and approaches employed. Our goal {{is to develop a}} theoretical framework and associated methodology and methods, in practice, in order to ascertain their suitability for investigating bilingual mathematics learners in an educational context. Moschkovich (2016) identified four key recommendations for conducting research on language: utilising interdisciplinary approaches, defining central constructs, building on existing methodologies, and recognizing central distinctions. Utilising Moschkovichâ s framework, this paper provides an appraisal of the methodology and methods to be employed in a research project examining bilingual mathematics learners...|$|R
25|$|Food {{supplies}} were frequently in terrible condition, infested with mould, weevils, worms, and maggots. Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats, and their containers were too fragile {{to sustain a}} long ocean voyage or <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> campaigning. The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil. British troops stationed in America were often {{on the verge of}} starvation.|$|E

These coatings are UV-cured urethane acrylate composite or polyimide materials {{applied to the}} outside of the fiber during the drawing process. The coatings protect the very delicate strands of glass fiber—about the size of a human hair—and allow it to survive <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing, proof testing, cabling and installation.|$|E

The experimental findings will benefit better understanding, development and to test new materials suitable to better withstand <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> space environments with applications in the design of future spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|Action {{research}} {{is seen as}} one of the solutions to the lack of relevance in the field of information systems because action research has as its primary goal to combine successful intervention in realworld settings with the development <b>of</b> scientific knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>rigor</b> <b>of</b> action research, however, has been questioned regularly. The IS field lacks a set of generally agreed guidelines and criteria to assess action research. This paper builds on earlier efforts to arrive at a set of principles and criteria to assess <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> <b>of</b> action research and provides the first comprehensive evaluation of 30 recently published AR field studies in mainstream IS journals to test whether such a set of principles and criteria proves to be useful. The objective is to provide a reference framework on which AR design choices can be made and AR papers can be reviewed. The framework proposed in this paper has proven to be applicable to different types of AR and many of its principles are followed in action research field studies. Based on the framework and the review of the field studies, recommendations are made to increase <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> <b>of</b> action research to achieve more relevance...|$|R

25|$|Holloway was {{an early}} ally of Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the {{controversial}} father of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. To induce promising line officers to submit to <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> nuclear training, Rickover insisted that only nuclear-qualified officers be allowed to command a nuclear vessel. Holloway agreed with Rickover's concept, and allowed Rickover to screen the candidate pool from which BuPers would select officers for nuclear training. Rickover retained this absolute control over nuclear candidate selection {{until his retirement in}} 1982.|$|E
