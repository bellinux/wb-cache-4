5|$|The Iazyges' <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was {{extremely}} important to their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the concessions offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges to move through Dacia and <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pontic Steppe.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E

There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E

The Spanish were not successful in maintaining <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natives and the post was abandoned within a few years.
