5000|$|She {{argued for}} a legal reformation of {{judicial}} laws, doctrines of appeals and better protection under <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> She reasoned that the individuals who created <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>would</b> be <b>the</b> only ones who would comprehend them. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>would</b> not be applicable or fair to lower socioeconomic classes who did not partake {{in the creation of}} them. Laws must be clear, written in simple language and precise so proper justice could be granted to the poor. Sabuco also argued against juridical doctrines of appeal to authority figures of Roman law. [...] Authoritarian power was passed down through generations and individuals' verdicts had varying interpretations from previous generations of authorities who lacked knowledge about the present case. [...] As a result, she believed protection under <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was unequal for most of the public and most did not receive proper justice.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{personal}} computing software industry in France is heavily {{dominated by a}} few companies (such as Microsoft and Apple Computer), which also provide DRM systems, it was feared that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>would</b> reinforce these dominant positions and prevent competition from free software.

25|$|In 1926, {{after several}} years of the Mexican revolutionary war and insecurity, President Plutarco Elías Calles, an atheist and leader of the ruling National Revolutionary Party, enacted the Calles Law, which {{eradicated}} all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding a public office. The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in {{what became known as the}} Cristero War.

Since Villepin's UMP party had an absolute majority in the Assembly, there was no chance that such a motion could be adopted.

25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else.

If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>would</b> state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E
25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>would</b> have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is {{supposed to be able to}} read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E
