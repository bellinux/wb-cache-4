5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. <b>The</b> <b>leak</b> and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E
5|$|ABC News {{reported}} that Harper's chief of staff, Ian Brodie {{was responsible for}} the details reaching the hands of the media. Harper has denied that Brodie was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method was}} demonstrated to seal leaks in geomembrane liners by attracting clay particles to <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> using electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{the movement of}} electrically charged particles suspended in a liquid {{by the action of}} an electric field. A direct-current voltage impressed across the liner causes electrical current to flow through <b>the</b> <b>leaks.</b> <b>The</b> current produces a strong electric field at leaks. When a clay slurry is dispersed into the liquid in the impoundment, electrophoresis attracts the clay particles to <b>the</b> <b>leaks,</b> thereby sealing them. The method can seal leaks in liquid impoundments without removing the liquid or locating or accessing <b>the</b> <b>leaks.</b> <b>The</b> laboratory and full-scale test results were remarkable in that electrophoresis sealed <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> completely when a layer of geofabric was under the liner, and electrophoresis reduced the leakage rate through holes as large as 10 mm in diameter by a factor of 1600 in the field test with gravel under the liner, and by a factor of 1667 in the laboratory basin with geonet under the liner. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood at the site of <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse {{first put}} in at Vigo, Spain, to change {{some of her}} crew, and then sailed for Whiddy Island on 30 December 1978.

However, the origin of <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in Bantry Bay on 4 January 1979.|$|E

The cause of <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> was a combination of the wrong type of concrete being used and the wrong construction method. These were specified correctly in the tender contracts, but after {{the contractor}} was chosen, an agreement was made between the municipality and Selmer {{for the use of the}} membrane method.
