40|$|We {{encounter}} {{others in}} need everyday. Often we may feel {{a twinge of}} their suffering, and sometimes we offer help or support. However, not every individual in need elicits these feelings, and people vary widely {{in the types of}} targets they choose to help. According to the Perception-Action Model of empathy (PAM; Preston & de Waal, 2002), the neural substrates that give rise to first-hand experiences of an emotion also underlie the understanding of that emotion in another. Therefore, an observer’s ability to understand and empathize with a target depends {{on the extent to which}} they have compatible representations of the target’s state. This dissertation investigates these predicted interactions between the personal representations of observers and the various emotional displays of targets, focusing on how these interactions impact empathic, physiological, and prosocial responses. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 demonstrate that individual differences in associations between females and sadness predict preferential giving to sad, distraught female hospital patients compared to more positive resilient females.

After an autobiographical memory task, participants read texts and answered questions that required a bridging inference to be generated.

Methods: 45 participants were recruited and assigned to the SD group (n = 22) or the control group (n = 23). Both groups maintained a normal sleep schedule on Day 1 night. On Day 2 night, the control group maintained a normal sleep schedule while the SD group were sleep deprived (sustained waking time > 24 hours). On Day 3 morning, both groups reported their sleepiness level and had an 8 -min resting-state EEG recording. Theta/beta and delta/beta ratios at frontal, central and parietal areas were calculated. Results: The SD group reported significantly higher sleepiness levels than the control group. It was found that compared with the control group, the SD group had higher theta/beta ratios at the frontal, central, and parietal areas, suggesting lower cortical regulation of subcortical activities.

40|$|A {{suboptimal}} {{bias toward}} accepting {{the status quo}} option in decision-making is well established behaviorally, but the underlying neural mechanisms are less clear.

Such asymmetry in the genesis of regret might drive the status quo bias on subsequent decisions, if indeed erroneous status quo rejections have a greater neuronal impact than erroneous status quo acceptances. To test this, we acquired human fMRI data during a difficult perceptual decision task that incorporated a trial-to-trial intrinsic status quo option, with explicit signaling of outcomes (error or correct). Behaviorally, experienced regret was higher after an erroneous status quo rejection compared with acceptance. Anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex showed increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal after such status quo rejection errors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} dynamic theory {{of personality and}} emotions. The theory offered is explicit in its incorporation of an evolutionary-functionalist perspective and suggests that personality and the emotions are dynamic within the limits imposed by the functions of each. The dissertation begins by discussing the ubiquity of goals and goal-organising constructs in living systems. Personality, it is argued, is most validly conceptualised as being a complex goal-organising construct. Specific attention is then given to the consideration of innate motives in a motivational model of personality, {{the process by which}} innate motives become representational goals the place of emotions in the elaboration of innate motives, and the place of consciousness in goal, developmental and emotion processes. Following this, a functional conceptualisation of emotions and conscious emotional experience consistent with the motivational model of personality is developed. Empirical attention is devoted to the relationships between goals and emotions, the nature and measurement of conscious emotional experience, and the place of emotion in generating adaptive behaviour. Overall, <b>the</b> dissertation <b>suggests</b> that <b>emotions</b> and personality are necessarily related phenomena, each contributing to, and reflecting the other in the process of human striving...|$|R
40|$|Extract: Experience {{sampling}} {{studies have}} shown that mood and emotions at work vary considerably over short periods of time (Fisher 2 ̆ 6 Noble, 2000). The search for potential causes of this fluctuation must focus on equally transient stimuli. Logical candidates to cause emotion fluctuations at work are appraisals related to what one is doing and to how well one is doing it at the moment. The next section considers main effects of task characteristics on emotions during task engagement. The subsequent section builds the case that perceived performance can be a potent contributor to emotions experienced at work and <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>emotions</b> most likely to occur as a consequence of performance. Following that, attention is given to anticipatory emotions in advance of performance events, and relived emotions well after performance events.

40|$|Facial emotion {{recognition}} impairments {{have been}} reported in Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease(HD). However, the nature of the impairments across the spectrum of HD remains unclear. We report on emotion recognition data from 344 participants comprising premanifest HD (PreHD) and early HD patients, and controls. In a test of recognition of facial emotions, we examined responses to six basic emotional expressions and neutral expressions. In addition, and within the early HD sample, we tested for differences on emotion recognition performance between those ‘on’ vs. ‘off’ neuroleptic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. The PreHD groups showed significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) impaired recognition, compared to controls, on fearful, angry and surprised faces; whereas the early HD groups were significantly impaired across all emotions including neutral expressions. In early HD, neuroleptic use was associated with worse facial emotion recognition, whereas SSRI use was associated with better facial <b>emotion</b> recognition. <b>The</b> findings <b>suggest</b> that <b>emotion</b> recognition impairments exist across the HD spectrum, but are relatively more widespread in manifest HD than in the premanifest period.

40|$|Mood, Emotive Content, and Reasoning - Daniel Zahra Theories of how {{individuals}} reason, {{and how they}} experience emotion abound in the psychological literature; yet, despite the common lay-theories of how emotions might affect a person’s reasoning, very little empirical work has been conducted on this relationship. The current thesis addresses this knowledge-gap by first distilling from the literature two classes of emotion theory; Information, and Load; and then systematically testing the explanatory power of these theories. A dual-process framework is employed in order to define low (Type One) and high effort (Type Two) strategies. Information theories predict that negative emotion cues more analytic processing relative to positive emotion, whereas load theories predict {{both positive and negative}} emotion to suppress use of high-effort strategies. Thus the two theories are compared by varying incidental and integral emotion across syllogistic reasoning, conditional reasoning, and the ratio-bias task, and assessing the engagement of Type One and Type Two processes across positive emotion, negative emotion, and control conditions. <b>The</b> findings <b>suggest</b> that <b>emotion</b> effects in syllogistic reasoning do not consistently support either Load or Information theories (Experiments 1 - 4). Emotion effects are found to be typically larger for integral than incidental emotion (Experiment 5), and most frequently serve as Information in verbal (Experiments 6 and 7) and visual conditional reasoning tasks (Experiment 8). Furthermore, these effects are to a large extent dependent on task properties such as the number of alternative antecedents (Experiments 9 and 10), and are greater on more difficult tasks (Experiments 11 and 12). These findings <b>suggest</b> that <b>emotion</b> has a greater impact on Type Two than Type One processes.

40|$|People {{regulate}} {{their emotions}} {{in everyday life}} to varying extents (Gross & John, 2003). Emotion regulation {{has been found to}} influence memory, although {{it has been argued that}} the effects are due to stimulus elaboration rather than changes in emotional arousal (Dillon et al., 2007). We investigated whether individual differences in emotion regulation may influence how emotion affects memory. We gave participants instructions at encoding to reappraise photographic scenes either enhancing, decreasing or maintaining their emotions. The degree of successful emotional regulation was measured through changes in physiological arousal (galvanic skin response and heart rate) and subjective ratings of emotional experience. After a one-day delay free recall was increased for negative arousing photographs when participants had enhanced their emotions, but there was no significant effect of a decrease in <b>emotions.</b> This <b>suggests</b> that changes in emotional arousal may be directly influencing memory, rather than through a process of stimulus elaboration.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{dynamics}} and interplay of meaning, emotions, and power in institutional work. Based on an empirical study, we explore and elaborate on the rhetorical strategies of emotion work that institutional actors employ to mobilize emotions for discursive institutional work. In an empirical context where a powerful institutional actor is tasked with creating support and acceptance for a new political and economic institution, we identify three rhetorical strategies of emotion work: eclipsing, diverting and evoking emotions. These strategies are employed to arouse, regulate, and organize emotions that underpin legitimacy judgments and drive resistance among field constituents. We find that actors exercise influence and engage in overt forms of emotion work by evoking shame and pride to sanction and reward particular expedient ways of thinking and feeling about the new institutional arrangements. More importantly, however, the study shows that they also engage in strategies of discursive institutional work that seek to exert power—force and influence—in more subtle ways by eclipsing and diverting the collective fears, anxieties, and moral indignation that drive resistance and breed negative legitimacy evaluations. Overall, <b>the</b> study <b>suggests</b> that <b>emotions</b> {{play an important role}} in institutional work associated with creating institutions, not only via “pathos appeals” but also as tools of discursive, cultural-cognitive meaning work and in the exercise of power in the field...|$|R
