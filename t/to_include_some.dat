In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>some</b> $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E

5|$|The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed. Journalist Brad Gooch {{argues in}} his 2002 {{profile of the}} Urantia {{movement}} that Sadler {{was the author of}} The Urantia Book, citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings. Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also contends that Sadler refused <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>some</b> material provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, contends that statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did not write, or extensively edit, The Urantia Book.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the Anglican {{authorities}} officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, {{and was one of the}} first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>some</b> by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>some</b> exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
