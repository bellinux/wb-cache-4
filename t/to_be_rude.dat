5|$|When Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) are {{threatened}} with banishment by Michael after they constantly gaze happily on each other, Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) invites {{them to have}} lunch with her and her husband Bob Vance (Robert R. Shafer). Their meal initially goes well, but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives. Hungry and not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E

25|$|Courtesy {{is highly}} valued in South Africa, and is {{perceived}} {{a sign of}} honor. Different cultures such as the Tamil, Urdu, Bantu and others express their courtesy for others through their language and customs vary with culture. Social status and gender is marked through individual's etiquette practices. The older one is or depending upon their position within society (politics especially) and the family comes from projects respect from others and dignity for one's culture. Families in rural areas have special customs in which they greet each other and show appreciation. In more urbanized areas, these same customs are not present, however, social status are nevertheless defined. Those who enter {{the house of a}} family must say hello to the parents of the household using the name of the couple's eldest sibling. (i.e. Hello, Mother of...) The youngest children must make way for their elders around the home allowing them to come through. If one is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> it is considered a big deal.|$|E
500|$|Chris Turner {{writes in}} his book [...] that the episode {{illustrates}} how Homer Simpson is [...] "an organism of considerable complexity". Turner comments, [...] "Homer is carrying the full symbolic weight of twentieth-century America on his shoulders, and no garden-variety doofus could manage that task." [...] Turner discusses a moment from the episode where Marge tells her sisters, [...] "Homer doesn't mean <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude,</b> he's just a very complicated man", after which Homer breaks a plate {{over his head and}} shouts [...] "Wrong!" [...] Turner writes that this [...] "revelatory moment" [...] is illustrative of [...] "several of the best-known aspects of Homer's character: his impulsiveness, his inherent silliness, his evident, even physical stupidity".|$|E
500|$|Matsumoto was {{responsible}} for the level design. While preparing destructible elements within the environment, the staff took care that they could be easily recognized by the player. So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs, the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael, so the player would be kept within his point of view. A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay, which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re-balancing it. The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as [...] "chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords, magic and guns or ally command systems". The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system's design. This concept was a hangover from the game's origins as a science fiction story. For the multiplayer, Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> to one-another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single-player campaign. This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game.|$|E

50|$|The phrase feck is {{a common}} {{substitute}} for fuck in Ireland, where it <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>rude,</b> though still not acceptable in many contexts.

Although the word <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equally as <b>rude</b> as fuck, its appearance in Father Ted and in a Magner's Cider advert suggest the opposite.|$|R

500|$|Although {{official}} attitudes did {{not place}} much {{value on the}} moors, William Bunting moved to Thorne after the Second World War and became an advocate for moor preservation. Thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> and irascible, he began a campaign to recognise the ecological importance of the moors. He asserted that the enclosures of the 1800s, when common rights were replaced by private ownership, had been illegal, as was much of the commercial exploitation of his time. He {{seemed to have a}} good deal of evidence to support his claims, and took several major utilities to court over acts which he felt were illegal. He won a series of high-profile cases, which he used as publicity to advance the case for conserving the moors. In 1972, Bunting began direct action, aided by local residents, local naturalists, and students. During the week, the peat extraction company Fisons would cut drains {{to begin the process of}} lowering the water table. During the weekends, Bunting's Beavers, as his team became known, would walk onto the moors and construct dams across the new ditches, to retain the water levels. By the summer, the Beavers appeared to be winning the battle, and their activities were featured on BBC television. Fisons dynamited eighteen of the dams, but the activists were undeterred and began rebuilding them. Finally, Fisons conceded defeat, and negotiated with the Nature Conservancy Council on the future management of the moors in 1974. The government granted some [...] Site of Special Scientific Interest status in 1981. Although this had little immediate effect, it has contributed to subsequent appreciation of the area and its importance as an ecological resource.|$|E
2500|$|Private Norman Demuth, who {{had been}} {{discharged}} from the British Army after being wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after returning from the Western Front, and decided that if the women that handed them out were going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> to him, he was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> back. One of the last feathers he received was presented to him whilst he was travelling on a bus, by a lady who was sat opposite him. She handed over the feather and said, [...] "Here's a gift for a brave soldier." [...] Demuth replied, [...] "Thank you very much - I wanted one of those." [...] He then used the feather to clean out his pipe, handed {{it back to her}} and remarked, [...] "You know we didn't get these in the trenches." [...] The other passengers subsequently became angry with the woman and started shouting at her, much to Demuth's amusement.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this stage}} of his career Kitchener was keen to exploit the press, {{cultivating}} G. W. Steevens of the Daily Mail who wrote a book With Kitchener to Khartum. Later, as his legend had grown, he was able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> to the press, on one occasion in the Second Boer War bellowing: [...] "Get out of my way, you drunken swabs". He was created Baron Kitchener, of Khartoum and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, on 31 October 1898.|$|E

Although rehearsals ended just before Christmas 2005, Condon called Hudson back for a week of one-on-one rehearsals, to help her more fully become the [...] "diva" [...] character of Effie. Hudson was required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> and come in late both on set and off, and she and Condon went over Effie's lines and scenes throughout the week.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> then?", and shuts the door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the comic}} subplot, several {{characters}} conspire to make Olivia's pompous steward, Malvolio, believe that Olivia has fallen for him. This involves Olivia's uncle, Sir Toby Belch; another would-be suitor, a silly squire named Sir Andrew Aguecheek; her servants Maria and Fabian; and her fool, Feste. Sir Toby and Sir Andrew engage themselves in drinking and revelry, thus disturbing {{the peace of}} Olivia's house until late into the night, prompting Malvolio to chastise them. Sir Toby famously retorts, [...] "Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?" [...] (Act II, Scene III) Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria are urged to plan revenge on Malvolio. They convince Malvolio that Olivia is secretly {{in love with him}} by planting a love letter, written by Maria in Olivia's handwriting. It asks Malvolio to wear yellow stockings cross-gartered, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude</b> {{to the rest of the}} servants, and to smile constantly in the presence of Olivia. Malvolio finds the letter and reacts in surprised delight. He starts acting out the contents of the letter to show Olivia his positive response. Olivia is shocked by the changes in Malvolio and leaves him to the contrivances of his tormentors. Pretending that Malvolio is insane, they lock him up in a dark chamber. Feste visits him to mock his insanity, both disguised as a priest and as himself.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Cowell {{was given}} the role of judge on the first series of Pop Idol, a show {{that he and the}} show creator Simon Fuller {{successfully}} pitched to ITV Controller of Entertainment Claudia Rosencrantz. [...] Cowell's S Records signed the top two finishers of the first season of Pop Idol, Will Young and Gareth Gates, both of whom went on to have No 1 UK hits, which were the top 2 best-selling singles of 2002, {{as well as that of}} top 2 of the decade of 2000s. [...] He also became a judge on the first season of American Idol in 2002. With his notoriously critical reputation, Cowell has been likened to TV personalities such as Judith Sheindlin, and Anne Robinson of her show. [...] Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, [...] "I don't mean <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rude,</b> but ...", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from noted publicist Max Clifford (who was sacked by Cowell after being convicted of sex offences as of May 2014). Cowell also appeared on the one-off World Idol programme in 2003, where it became clear that each country's version of the Idol had attempted to come up with its own [...] "Simon Cowell" [...] type personality. In 2003, Cowell placed No 33 on Channel 4's list of the all-time 100 Worst Britons.|$|E
