5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Given <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living will, a {{trial was}} held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer {{during the week}} of January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the Florida Supreme Court in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Sprong first played hockey as a {{young child}} in his {{hometown}} of Amsterdam. Due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> developed hockey program in the Netherlands, at ages four and five, Sprong played on teams with players as old as twelve or thirteen. To help further Sprong's development in hockey, his family moved to L'Île-Bizard, Quebec in Canada, in 2005.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} {{population would}} seem to prevent the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and British Antarctic Territory, the New Zealand territory of Ross Dependency and the Australian external territories of Australian Antarctic Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands from competing.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, {{but can be}} distinguished by branches that taper upward, branch tips that are flattened (instead of spoon-like), and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color. Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non-leathery flesh texture and pointy branch tips.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{festival in}} 2006. Instead, a {{documentary}} film directed by Julien Temple was released {{to make up}} for <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> festival.

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate {{the presence of an}} orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually {{does not have a}} scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mineral rich in rubidium limits {{the production of}} rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E

5|$|American reviewers were {{enthusiastic}} of Deep Purple's {{live performances}} and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new successful single {{apparently did not}} ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, {{to the point that}} they were often addressed as an American band.

5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
