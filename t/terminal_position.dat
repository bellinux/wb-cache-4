500|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} is aplacental viviparous {{with the}} unborn young nourished by a yolk sac; reproduction occurs {{on an annual}} cycle. Most females have a single functional ovary (on the left side), though some have two; the oviducts are often filled with yolk, which has been speculated to be from unfertilized eggs being resorbed. Young embryos [...] long have translucent skin, protruding eyes, and exposed gill filaments. Spots of pigment have developed when the embryo is [...] long, and the first row of teeth have appeared when the embryo is [...] long. By the time the embryo is [...] long, the mouth has migrated to a <b>terminal</b> <b>position</b> and the color pattern has fully developed; the external yolk sac begins to shrink as the yolk is transferred to an internal yolk sac, which holds it until it can {{be transferred to the}} intestine for digestion. The internal yolk sac is fully resorbed before birth; if the pup is released prematurely, it does not feed until this process is complete.|$|E

30|$|Depending on the {{investigation}} scenario (c.f., Section 3), the training dataset is constructed next by using the procedure outlined in Section 4. These training datasets are used to construct the multi-class Random forests model, where we rely on the implementation provided by OpenCV [23]. A total of 100 <b>terminal</b> <b>positions,</b> per <b>terminal,</b> are selected randomly from a set of 1000 <b>terminal</b> <b>positions</b> generated by Horizon, per terminal, to create training datasets of 0.25 million samples for each investigation scenario. The output from the random forests model is used to compute the goodput at the terminal, referred to as user goodput, using Eq. (4). The system goodput is computed by taking {{the sum of the}} user goodput for each time instance, and its average over all considered 100 <b>terminal</b> <b>positions</b> is used for system-based performance evaluation.|$|R

In general, mammalian sialic acid residues are at <b>terminal</b> <b>positions</b> (non-reducing end) in complex glycans, and so viral neuraminidases - which are exo-glycosidase enzymes - use these terminal residues as their substrates.|$|R
50|$|The new {{prosthesis}} {{corresponds to}} a conventional total prosthesis but the basis contains cavities so that the secondary crowns can be incorporated. The prosthesis is controlled at the <b>terminal</b> <b>position</b> and corrected if needed. The cavities are filled with a self-curing cement and the prosthesis {{is placed in the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>position.</b> After the self-curing process, the gold caps are definitely cemented in the prosthesis cavities and the prosthesis can now be detached. Excess cement may be removed and some corrections like polishing or under filling around the secondary crowns may be necessary.The new prosthesis is fitted using a construction of telescope double cone crowns. At the end position, the prosthesis buttons down on the abutments to ensure an adequate hold.|$|E

50|$|In {{this example}} the ring {{system can be}} thought of as {{analogous}} to butadiene. Following the Green-Davies-Mingos rules, since butadiene is an open pi-ligand of even hapticity, nucleophilic attack will occur at one of the <b>terminal</b> <b>positions</b> of the pi-system. This occurs because the LUMO of butadiene has larger lobes on the ends rather than the internal positions.|$|R

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a queue ( [...] ) is {{a particular}} kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear <b>terminal</b> <b>position,</b> known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front <b>terminal</b> <b>position,</b> known as dequeue. This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will {{be the first one to}} be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. Often a peek or front operation is also entered, returning the value of the front element without dequeuing it. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the achievable gains for mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>positioning</b> with 3 GPP-LTE when observing signals of opportunity. For that we calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound for pseudo range estimation based on 3 GPP-LTE positioning reference signals and for multiple <b>terminal</b> <b>positioning</b> {{taking into account}} signals of opportunity with unknown transmitter position. We show that at least four mobile terminals are {{required in order to}} benefit from observing such signals of opportunity. When comparing the Cramer-Rao lower bounds for different environments and different numbers of mobile terminals and observed signals of opportunity with the respective reference configurations without signals of opportunity, we can significantly improve positioning performance, especially indoors, where we suffer from lower received power levels compared to an outdoor environment. By observing 4 signals of opportunity, such as WiFi access points, with 10 mobile terminals indoors, we observe an improvement in positioning performance of approximately 70 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{absence of}} leaves, the {{presence}} of vascular tissue, the <b>terminal</b> <b>position</b> of the sporangia and {{the form of the}} branching of the stems (pseudomonopodial) suggest a relationship with the Rhyniaceae; however, the shape of the sporangia and the form of their dehiscence suggest a relationship with the lycophytes. Hence the position of the genus in the cladogram for the polysporangiophytes which Crane et al. published in 2004; Renalia is placed basal to the lycophytes (clubmosses and relatives).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe 2 -terminal one-to-any problem, which {{arises in}} the design of layout systems, is the problem of {{assigning}} wach one of n <b>terminals</b> <b>positioned</b> on the upper row of a channel (called entry terminals) to one of m <b>terminals</b> <b>positioned</b> on the lower row (called exit terminals) so that the resulting channel routing problem has minimum density. An optimal solution to this problem is known [1]. In this paper we consider a natural generalization, the 2 -color one-to-any problem, in which we have two types of entry terminals, red and blue ones, and exit terminals can be assigned to either type of entry terminal. Red and blue nets created by our algorithm are allowed to run {{on top of each other}} in the routing, and the density is defined as the larger of the red density and the blue density. Its minimization is an interesting combinatorial problem. We show how to compute the best achievable density in O(n + m) time, and an assignment achieving this density in O((n + m) log(n + m)) time...|$|R

50|$|Oligonucleotides or DNA {{fragments}} need to {{be activated}} to contain chemically reactive groups to facilitate coupling with the activated gel elements. Probe activation depends on the chemistry of activation of the polyacrylamide gels.

Probes are usually prepared by introduction of chemically active groups in <b>terminal</b> <b>position</b> of the oligonucleotides during their synthesis.|$|E
