5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong {{incentive}} {{for individuals to}} buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E

25|$|Ruth Handler {{watched her}} {{daughter}} Barbara play with paper dolls, {{and noticed that}} she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gap in the market, Handler suggested {{the idea of an}} adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this is now}} thought {{unlikely}} in {{the near}} future, {{it has also been}} suggested that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shutdown of thermohaline circulation, similar to that which is believed to have driven the Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate change event. There is also potentially a possibility of a more general disruption of ocean circulation, which may lead to an ocean anoxic event, although these are believed to be much more common in the distant past. It is unclear whether the appropriate pre-conditions for such an event exist today.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline has {{relatively}} high (nanomolar) {{affinity for the}} sigma σ1 receptor. Conversely, it has low (micromolar) and insignificant affinity for the σ2 receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the σ1 receptor, {{and is able to}} reverse σ1 receptor-dependent actions of fluvoxamine, a potent agonist of the receptor, in vitro. However, the affinity of sertraline for the σ1 receptor is more than 100-fold lower than for the SERT. Although <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear and perhaps questionable.|$|E
25|$|Artificial {{reproductive}} {{technology is}} becoming more available. Early studies suggest that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> increased risk for medical complications with both the mother and baby. Some of these include low birth weight, placental insufficiency, chromosomal disorders, preterm deliveries, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia(Aiken and Brockelsby).|$|R

25|$|The {{view has}} been taken {{that it may be}} rather {{burdensome}} for the Prosecution to have to prove the alleged contemnor was unaware of any rational basis for the criticism. Furthermore, although the Court did not mention this, since the effect of a statement has to be judged from an average reasonable person's point of view, perhaps the rational basis for the criticism should be apparent to the person in some manner. For example, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> requirement that the statement expressly mention the basis, or {{that it is possible to}} imply the basis from the statement. The basis might also be discernible from external sources such as media reports, so long as this is clear to an average reasonable person.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} {{constituent}} countries of the United Kingdom, Scotland is represented by Members of Parliament at the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, London. In 1997 a referendum was held, {{and the people of}} Scotland voted {{for the establishment of a}} devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The new parliament has the power to govern the country on Scotland-specific matters and has a limited power to vary income tax. The United Kingdom Parliament retains responsibility for Scotland's defence, international relations and certain other areas. A Scottish independence referendum was held in September 2014, at which time independence was rejected. However, due to the Brexit result in which Scotland voted to stay in the Eu (62%); <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> second independence referendum.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively {{it seems}} {{unlikely}} that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> retraction of D n onto S n − 1, and in the case n = 1 it is obviously impossible because S 0 (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval D 1) is not even connected. The case n = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the fundamental groups of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the fundamental group of S 1 to that of D 2, but the first group is isomorphic to Z while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case n = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing vector fields.|$|E

50|$|Economist David Wyss of S&P has {{posited that}} if GM and Chrysler disappear, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} of about 1 million imported cars every year, which would remove about $25 {{billion from the}} U.S. economy. That would reduce GDP by 0.2 percentage points annually—excluding the impact of lost jobs (higher unemployment) and wages.|$|R
25|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax was implemented, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong {{incentive}} {{for individuals to}} buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax was in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. On the other hand, the FairTax includes a 23% inclusive transitional inventory tax credit {{on the cost of}} the inventory to be applied in the month that it is sold. The transitional inventory tax credit would significantly reduce any changes to the net cost after switching to the FairTax. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. On the other hand, proponents of the FairTax note that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt quicker.|$|E
25|$|A Waterloo and Whitehall Railway was {{promoted}} in 1864, {{to construct a}} tube railway from Great Scotland Yard to Waterloo. It was to use air pressure to propel the vehicles northwards, and was to exhaust air to draw them southwards, using a pressure differential of 2½ oz per sq in (about 11 mbar). The trains themselves would be the pistons. The company capital was to be £100,000. It was suggested that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> branch to where the Embankment station is now located: {{it is not clear}} how a junction would be managed in a pneumatic railway. There were to be three vehicles, one loading at each terminal and one in motion in the tube, so they must have been intended to pass at the terminals. There were to be three classes of accommodation in the coaches.|$|E
25|$|However, in verb {{expressions}} {{accompanied by}} an object pronoun, Brazilians normally place it amid the auxiliary verb and the main one (ela vem me pagando but not ela me vem pagando or ela vem pagando-me). In some cases, in order to adapt this use to the standard grammar, some Brazilian scholars recommend that ela vem me pagando should be written like ela vem-me pagando (as in EP), {{in which case the}} enclisis could be totally acceptable if there would not be a factor of proclisis. Therefore, this phenomenon may or not be considered improper according to the prescribed grammar, since, according to the case, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor of proclisis that would not permit the placement of the pronoun between the verbs (e.g. when there is a negative adverb near the pronoun, in which case the standard grammar prescribes proclisis, ela não me vem pagando and not ela não vem-me pagando). Nevertheless, nowadays, it is becoming perfectly acceptable to use a clitic between two verbs, without linking it with a hyphen (as in poderia se dizer, or não vamos lhes dizer) and this usage (known as: pronome solto entre dois verbos) can be found in modern(ist) literature, textbooks, magazines and newspapers like Folha de S.Paulo and O Estadão (see in-house style manuals of these newspapers, available on-line, for more details).|$|E
50|$|The {{pervasiveness of}} mental health {{illnesses}} can be illustrated {{by looking at the}} size of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (DSM IV-TR). Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in mental health cases globally. In 2050, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> epidemic of neurological diseases.
