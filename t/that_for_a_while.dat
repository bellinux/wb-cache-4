The abrupt northerly turn meant <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> on August 17, the Azores were threatened by Danielle in the long-range forecast, as a weakened tropical storm or extratropical cyclone. Danielle weakened to a Category1 hurricane {{on the evening of}} August 17 as shear continued to increase. Danielle began to turn to the northeast early on August 18, and at that point, the weakening trend accelerated. Some of the deep convection was being removed from the system due to wind shear, and that morning, Danielle weakened to a tropical storm. The rapid weakening trend continued that afternoon, and Danielle weakened to a low-end tropical storm with 45mph (75km/h) winds late that evening. However, the intensity levelled off early on August 19 and Danielle remained a tropical storm for the next couple days over moderately warm water of around 78°F (just under 26°C) while south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|After trying <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{and with}} no land in sight, Taylor {{decided that it was}} {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

This brief account can be filled out, if Polyaenus's anecdotes related to the battle (found in his work Strategems) are to be believed. Polyaenus's accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis {{of the battle}}. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the allied Greek right and punched a hole in the allied Greek line. On the allied Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and became disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The allied Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle. Diodorus says that more than 1000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history; since there was now no army which could prevent Philip's advance, the war effectively ended.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller.

In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
