The effect of <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> layer to <b>the</b> reflection coefficients measured by the receiver can be cancelled by imaginatively adding an active LHM layer, which has a same thickness as <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> layer but an opposite sign of the constitutive parameters. Therefore, the updated reflection coefficients obtained after this data process look like <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> layer has been removed, {{which leads to a}} significant improvement of the target imaging. When <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> layer is inhomogeneous due to the existence of small defects, we use a homogenization procedure based on the Drude model to characterize its effective constitutive parameters.

40|$|Abstract—The {{two most}} {{prevalent}} notions of common information {{are due to}} Wyner and Gács-Körner and both the notions can be stated as two different characteristic points in the lossless Gray-Wyner region. Although these quantities can be easily evaluated for random variables with infinite entropy (eg. continuous random variables), the operational significance underlying their definition is applicable only to the lossless framework. The primary objective {{of this paper is}} to generalize these two notions of common information to <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> Gray-Wyner network, which extends the theoretical intuition underlying their definitions for general sources and distortion measures. We begin with <b>the</b> <b>lossy</b> generalization of Wyner’s common information, defined as the minimum rate on the shared branch of the Gray-Wyner network at minimum sum rate when the two decoders reconstruct the sources subject to individual distortion constraints. We derive a complete single letter information theoretic characterization for this quantity and use it to compute the common information of symmetric bivariate Gaussian random variables.
