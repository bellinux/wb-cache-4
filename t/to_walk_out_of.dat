Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle, although she was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the school. The pair then shot out the windows to the East Entrance of the school.

25|$|In 1938, at age 19, Wallace {{contributed to}} his grandfather's {{successful}} campaign for probate judge. Late in 1945, he was appointed {{as one of the}} assistant attorneys general of Alabama, and in May 1946, he won his first election as a member to the Alabama House of Representatives. At the time, he was considered a moderate on racial issues. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he did not join the Dixiecrat walkout at the convention, despite his opposition to U.S. President Harry S. Truman's proposed civil rights program. Wallace considered it an infringement on states' rights. The Dixiecrats carried Alabama in the 1948 general election, having rallied behind Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. In his 1963 inaugural speech as governor, Wallace excused his failure <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 1948 convention on political grounds.|$|E
25|$|Militant secularism of the Republic {{started to}} turn Caylà into its enemy; he was also {{increasingly}} embittered by what he perceived as arrogant Republican-Socialist domination in the Valls council. In 1932 he unsuccessfully ran for the Catalan parliament from the Unio Ciutadana list; following triumphant Esquerra victory he was forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> l’Ajuntamient and later kept denouncing decomposition of local authorities and growing chaos in Valls. Fearing the forthcoming revolution Caylà started to present Traditionalism as the only bulwark which could stop it, with the government controlled by freemasonry and serving foreign interests. As the Joventut line hardened, it became target of administrative sanctions; the periodical was suspended from August to November 1932 with support for Sanjuriada quoted as a justification. Other penalties soon followed, be it either heavy fines, further suspensions or detentions.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{controversy}} in the country, McKinley and Hanna decided that an explicit mention of the gold standard in the party platform {{would be a better}} strategy than remaining silent on the issue. [...] McKinley sent Hanna to the convention with a draft plank calling for maintenance of the gold standard, which Hanna successfully placed in the party platform. [...] The adoption of the plank caused some Republicans, mostly from the West, <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the convention. [...] As they left, Hanna stood on a chair, shouting [...] "Go! Go! Go!" ...|$|E

500|$|Before the Republican convention, McKinley {{had been}} a [...] "straddle bug" [...] on the {{currency}} question, favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement. In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the convention. However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{within the}} episode {{contains}} a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes {{the city as}} a [...] "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of a song in , which speaks of London in unflattering terms ("There's No Place Like London"). Al Jean later explained that two Cajun characters were supposed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent. An early version of the scene can be seen in an animatic included in the DVD boxset.|$|E

On the issue of South Africa, Dahomey was one of five countries <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> discussions in the Union of African States on opening contact with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Dahomey supported opening contact and trade relations with the regime, unlike {{much of the rest of}} the African states, and abstained on the final vote.|$|E

500|$|The event {{began with}} a video package of the event and its theme, [...] "Night of Champions," [...] {{followed}} by opening pyrotechnics. The first match was between Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch and The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the World Tag Team Championship. Cade and Matt started the match, with Matt in control. The two teams tagged in and out until Cade and Murdoch attempted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the match, but the Hardys went after them, and brought {{them back into the}} ring. Jeff attempted a Swanton Bomb onto Cade, but Murdoch interfered on Cade's behalf. Matt tried to interfere on Jeff's behalf, but was stopped by the referee. Murdoch used this as an advantage, and pushed Jeff off the turnbuckle, leading to Cade performing a powerbomb. Cade gained the pinfall on Jeff to win the match and retain the titles.|$|E
500|$|Final mixing for {{the song}} took place on 21 June as the Beatles rushed to {{complete}} Revolver before beginning {{the first leg of}} their 1966 world tour. Harrison discussed [...] "Love You To" [...] with Shankar when the two musicians met that month, at a social event hosted by the Angadi family. Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had yet to hear [...] "Norwegian Wood", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely [...] "experiments". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: [...] "I felt I wanted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my home that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta.

IndiaGlitz gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "The biggest strength of Drushyam is not its genre, but the fact that an excellent screenplay has been written around too less characters for a movie of this genre and without sub plots and the like", and added that [...] "Drushyam is edge-of-the-seat, but it doesn't demand the audience to connect the threads. An unconventional film, this film is refreshing as it is not formulaic".|$|E

60|$|A {{description}} {{of him in}} his own language leaped into Honora's mind, so much did he appear <b>to</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the many}} yellow-backed novels she had read. He was not tall, but beautifully made, and his coat was quite absurdly cut in at the waist; his mustache was en-croc, and its points resembled those of the Spanish bayonets in the conservatory: he might have been three and thirty, and he was what the novels described as 'un peu fane' which means that he had seen the world: his eyes were extraordinarily bright, black, and impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|We {{found my}} aunt alone, {{in a state}} of some excitement. A {{difference}} of opinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract question (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex); and my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp, had cut the dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy, and that she would trouble her <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out.</b> Both <b>of</b> these expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, and had expressed her intention of bringing before a 'British Judy'--meaning, it was supposed, the bulwark of our national liberties.|$|R
