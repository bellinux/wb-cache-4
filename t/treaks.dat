50|$|In the United Kingdom, the blue, banded, {{fluorite}} {{known as}} Blue John is found only under the triangular hill known as <b>Treak</b> Cliff, {{just outside the}} town of Castleton. Today the veins are mined only in Blue John Cavern and the nearby <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern, although the abandoned Old Tor Mine {{on the north side}} of Winnats Pass was also, at one time, a source for the mineral.|$|R
5000|$|C. auge, C. carringtonensis, C. insulae, and C. tuberculigenata {{occur at}} the Lower Carboniferous of the United Kingdom (Asbian, Bee Low Limestones Formation, <b>Treak</b> Cliff, England).|$|R
50|$|Since their {{original}} formation, the caverns have been decorated by {{the formation of}} flowstone, stalagmites and stalactites. Two stalagmite samples from the Aladdin's Cave section of the <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern have been found, by means of radioactive dating, to date back 111,000 years, proving the cave itself is much older. The formations in <b>Treak</b> Cliff are variously stained orange or red by iron, white by lead and occasionally green or blue by copper. Some of the stalactites have been distorted by variations in the flow to form twisted structures known as helictites.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{attractive}} banding, and the rarity of the mineral, Blue John has commercial value and ornaments made from it are much sought after by collectors. Historically, {{as well as}} from <b>Treak</b> Cliff and Blue John Cavern, veins of the mineral were also worked from Old Tor Mine and another mine in Winnats Pass, and also from mines near Windy Knoll and Odin Mine, towards Mam Tor. Limited opencast extraction of Blue John took place on the top of <b>Treak</b> Cliff during World War II, and an incident of unofficial and illegal extraction from Old Tor Mine in the 1970s led to that mine being closed by order of H.M. Inspector of Mines, leaving <b>Treak</b> Cliff and Blue John Cavern as the two remaining sources of new stocks of the mineral. Both caves have a policy of supplying raw Blue John only to shops within Castleton, so the few outlets selling it elsewhere rely on old stocks.|$|R
50|$|At {{the base}} of the Tor and nearby are four show caves: Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern, Peak Cavern and <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern where lead, Blue John, {{fluorspar}} and other minerals were once mined.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK Blue John, or [...] "Derbyshire Spar", {{is found}} only in Blue John Cavern and the nearby <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern. It {{is a type of}} banded fluorite. The most common {{explanation}} for the name is that it derives from the French bleu-jaune, meaning 'blue-yellow', but other derivations have been suggested.|$|R
5|$|Fluorite or {{fluorspar}} {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name allegedly {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, {{and only a few}} hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining still takes place in the nearby <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern.|$|R
50|$|Castleton later prospered from lead mining; the Odin Mine, one of {{the oldest}} lead mines in the country, is {{situated}} 1.5 km west of the village (see also Derbyshire lead mining history). This created and enlarged local caverns, four of which are now open to the public as Peak Cavern, Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern and <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern. A small amount of Blue John is mined locally.|$|R

50|$|Blue John (also {{known as}} Derbyshire Spar) is a semi-precious mineral, {{a form of}} {{fluorite}} with bands of a purple-blue or yellowish colour. In the UK it is found only at Blue John Cavern and <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern at Castleton in Derbyshire. During the 19th century, it was mined for its ornamental value, and mining continues on a small scale. Deposits of fluorite have been recently found in China with colouring and banding similar to the classic Blue John stone.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} famous of the older-known localities of {{fluorite}} is Castleton in Derbyshire, England, where, under the name of Derbyshire Blue John, purple-blue fluorite was extracted from several mines or caves. During the 19th century, this attractive fluorite was mined for its ornamental value. The mineral Blue John is now scarce, and only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. Mining still takes place in Blue John Cavern and <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern.|$|R
50|$|At <b>Treak</b> Cliff {{and nearby}} Blue John Cavern, the {{fluorspar}} is uniquely banded, ranging from blue-black to white. The exact {{cause of the}} coloration is disputed, {{but it seems that}} the formation of Blue John requires a rare combination of porous limestone containing a little hydrocarbon, small traces of radioactive elements, an impervious layer to prevent the mineral fluids and hydrocarbons from escaping, a high concentration of fluorine ions, and variations in conditions during the crystallization process to form the banded colours. The rarity of this combination of conditions explains the scarcity of Blue John.|$|R
50|$|<b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern {{is a show}} cave near Castleton in Derbyshire, England. It {{is part of the}} Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest and one of {{only two}} sites where the {{ornamental}} mineral Blue John is still excavated (the other is the nearby Blue John Cavern). As part of an agreement with English Nature, the Blue John that {{can be seen in the}} show cave is not mined but it is extracted in small quantities from other areas of the cave and made into saleable items like bowls, jewellery and ornaments.|$|R
500|$|Bakewell is {{the largest}} {{settlement}} and the only town within the National Park; its five-arched bridge over the River Wye dates from the 13th century. Castleton, overshadowed by Peveril Castle, has four show caves, the Peak, Blue John, <b>Treak</b> Cliff, and Speedwell, and is the centre of production of the semi-precious mineral Blue John. The small village of Eyam {{is known for its}} self-imposed quarantine during the Black Death of 1665. Edale is the southern terminus of the Pennine Way, and is sometimes considered to be {{the southern end of the}} Pennines. Other villages within the park include [...] Flash, Hathersage, Hartington, Ilam and Tideswell.|$|R
50|$|<b>Treak</b> Cliff, {{the hill}} in which the cavern lies, is {{composed}} of Carboniferous Limestone; the steep eastern slope of the hill {{is thought to have}} been the edge of a reef on the margin of a tropical lagoon. This reef was then raised above sea level by an uplift in the Earth's crust and was subsequently eroded, forming a boulder bed on the slopes. This was subsequently overlain by deltaic river sediments, which formed the shale and Millstone Grit sandstones that still overlay the limestone to the north, and on top of those the Coal Measures formed, until the limestone was deep beneath the surface and subject to high temperature and pressure. Major earth movements {{at the end of the}} Carboniferous period reversed this subsidence, and the rock layers were raised to form an anticline, the top of which was eroded away. Surface streams, on meeting the limestone, percolated through cracks and weaknesses and started to dissolve the limestone to form caverns. The stream that formed the New Series once flowed into the lower end of Winnats Pass, whereas the stream that formed the Old Series lost its headwaters to the predecessor of the modern Odin Sitch as it cut down through soft shales. There is no modern stream in the <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern, but percolating water from the cave has been dye-tested and found to emerge at the Russet Well beside Peakshole Water near Peak Cavern in Castleton, taking between 13 and 20 hours to travel the distance.|$|R
50|$|On 9 December 2006 Darren Purse scored {{their first}} goal since the win over Burnley against Ipswich Town {{which ended in}} a 2 - 2 draw. On 20 January 2007 Cardiff broke their poor run of form after going eleven games without a win with a 2 - 1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. They then went undefeated until a month later on 20 February 2007 this time West Bromwich Albion ended Cardiff's run but the side were still mid-table. Even though they hit {{straight}} back with a win over Preston North End, another loss to Birmingham City then a 1 - 0 win over Norwich City {{was followed by a}} winless <b>treak</b> which lasted {{until the end of the}} season, finishing in 13th place.|$|R
5000|$|By the 19th century Blue John {{was being}} {{fashioned}} {{into a wide}} variety of ornamental items ranging from knife-handles to chalices. The precise quantities mined in any given year are unknown, but 18th-century leases restricted output to 20 tons per annum. By 1892, the output {{is said to have been}} limited to 3 tons per annum. Today, production is probably around half a ton per annum, and the raw Blue John produced is kept within Castleton where small articles, mainly jewellery, are worked and sold. A [...] "lost" [...] deposit was rediscovered in <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern in 2013, and in 2015 a new vein, the first for 150 years, was discovered close to the tourist route in the same cavern.|$|R
5000|$|Castleton attracts {{large numbers}} of tourists, {{and there are many}} pubs (some with accommodation), tea shops and guest houses to supply their needs. There is also a large car park, an {{information}} centre which houses Castleton Museum (closed for refurbishment until May 2017), several outdoors shops and a youth hostel. Many schools visit the area for educational studies such as GCSE fieldwork. It is also a major walking centre, where routes up Cave Dale, Winnats Pass, Mam Tor and Hollins Cross meet. There are four [...] "show caves" [...] to visit, Blue John Cavern, Peak Cavern, <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern and Speedwell Cavern which includes an underground boat ride and {{at least one of them}} is open all year.

500|$|Peveril Castle in Castleton {{is roughly}} {{triangular}} in shape, about , {{on top of}} a hill overlooking the Hope Valley. The land slopes steeply away from the castle's perimeter, forming an almost sheer face to the south east, and the winding approach from the north is the most practical way to the castle.

50|$|The {{pattern is}} {{sometimes}} so obscurely mottled, spirally and obliquely <b>treaked,</b> {{that it appears}} nearly uniform olivaceous, especially on the body whorl. The conic spire {{is more or less}} elevated. The minute apex is acute, reddish, when not eroded. The sutures are well impressed. The shell contains six whorls that are spirally more or less obviously, finely, irregularly striate or lirate. The body whorl is rounded or subcarinated at the periphery. The base of the shell is somewhat convex, more or less impressed around the axis, sometimes eroded in front of the aperture. The large aperture is very oblique. The outer lip contains a black-spotted green edge, which is generally followed by a broad thin opaque-white band, within which it is nacreous and iridescent. The oblique columella is thin-edged, the edge convex in the middle. The columellar area is white and more or less eroded. The umbilical tract is covered by a thick pad of enamel.|$|R
40|$|The {{gaussian}} ensemble and its {{extended version}} theoretically play {{the important role}} of interpolating ensembles between the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles. Here, the thermodynamic properties yielded by the extended gaussian ensemble (EGE) for the Blume-Capel (BC) model with infinite-range interactions are analyzed. This model presents different predictions for the first-order phase transition line according to the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. From the EGE approach, we explicitly work out the analytical microcanonical solution. Moreover, the general EGE solution allows one to illustrate in details how the stable microcanonical states are continuously recovered as the gaussian parameter γ is increased. We found out that {{it is not necessary to}} take the theoretically expected limit γ→∞ to recover the microcanonical states in the region between the canonical and microcanonical tricritical points of the phase diagram. By analyzing the entropy as a function of the magnetization we realize the existence of unaccessible magnetic states as the energy is lowered, leading to a <b>treaking</b> of ergodicity.

5000|$|Trace {{elements}} from buried sediments, percolating rain water, and trapped sea water meant various inorganic ions were present within the porous rock, among them chlorine, fluorine, sulphate, calcium, barium, lead, zinc and even uranium. Organic {{material from the}} decomposing bodies of marine animals in the sediments formed hydrocarbons, precursors of oil and gas. At high pressure a hot mineralised fluid formed and was forced into fractures and other voids in the rock. From this fluid, catalysed by the hydrocarbons, compounds such as galena (lead sulphide, PbS), sphalerite (zinc sulphide, ZnS), baryte (barium sulphate, BaSO4) and fluorspar (calcium fluoride, CaF2) were precipitated as solid crystals. At <b>Treak</b> Cliff the mineralised fluid was particularly rich in fluorine and 99% of the deposited mineral is fluorspar (technically, fluorite is the pure crystal and fluorspar the industrial name for the impure substance as mined). The exploitable deposits of fluorspar are known as [...] "rakes", [...] "scrins", [...] "flats" [...] or [...] "pipes" [...] {{depending on the size}} and shape of the voids in which the crystals were deposited.|$|R
50|$|The {{veins of}} lead in the Castleton area formed 280 million years ago when a fault in the local Carboniferous {{limestone}} allowed mineralising fluids to flow into fissures in the rock, pushed up by great pressure from beneath the Earth's surface. Lead and sulphate combined to form the lead ore galena. In its heyday, the mine was a complex system of levels and shafts that extended for approximately 1500 metres into the Edale shales beneath the nearby Mam Tor. In the early days the mining was open cast, forming a gorge in the hillside with the water diverted by a leat to the north to keep the workings dry. Later the miners followed the vein of lead underground. The vein is exposed on the surface in a small limestone outcrop {{at the entrance to}} the mine and then continues underground just south of due west in the limestone under the Edale shales of Mam Tor. The 1769 plans of the mine show that there were several branch veins leading from the main lead workings. There are several small pipe caverns contained within the mine; the most prominent of these is Odin Cave (called Gank Hole by the miners) which was formed by groundwater opening out a void between limestone boulders. There is no evidence that Blue John was ever mined at Odin although the adjacent <b>Treak</b> Cliff Cavern regularly mines the rock in areas not open to visitors.|$|R
40|$|In a free {{electron}} laser, coherent radiation {{is generated by}} letting an electron beam propagate through an alternating magnetic field. The magnetic field is created by a linear array of magnets, which is called an undulator or a wiggler. The wavelength of the laser radiation depends on the amplitude and wavelength of the magnetic field, and on {{the energy of the}} electrons. For a short-wavelength or high-power {{free electron}} laser, an electron beam with a low beam divergence, low energy spread and a high peak current is required. At the present time, the only way to generate such an electron beam is by means of a photoinjector. In such a device, an electron beam is created by illuminating a photo cathode with intense pulses of light from a drive laser system. The electron bunches that are emitted from the photoemissive material are accelerated in a radio-frequency linear accelerator. TEU-FEL is a free electron laser operated by the Nederlands Centrum voor Laser Research in close collaboration with the University of Twente. The electron beam in TE-FEL is generated in a photoinjector. This set-up {{is the subject of this}} thesis. One of the most critical components of a photoinjector is the drive laser system which illuminates the photo cathode. The Nd:YLF system that is used at TEU-FEL is described in Chapter 2. It emits trains of laser pulses, called macropulses, that consist of up to 1200 micropulses. The repetition rate of the macropulses is 10 Hz, the micropulses repeat at a frequency of 81. 25 MHz. The research focused on the stability of the system output power during a macropulse. A feed forward loop was constructed that can optimise and stabilise the shape of the output macropulse within 1 %. Most photo cathode materials are not sensitive to the fundamental of Nd:YLF (1053 nm). It is therefore necessary to generate the second or fourth harmonic of the Nd:YLF laser. A walk-off compensated frequency quadrupling scheme has been designed, which yields an energy conversion efficiency of 25 % from the fundamental to the fourth harmonic. The duration of the infrared and visible micropulses has been measured with autocorrelation techniques and with a streak camera. Chapter 3 treats several aspects of photo cathode materials. A photo cathode material is characterised by its quantum efficiency (QE) which is defined as the number of emitted electrons per incident photon. Several photo cathode materials have been used in the linear accelerator, most notably alkali-antimony and alkali-tellurium compounds. The former are mainly sensitive to visible radiation and have a typical QE » 1 %; the latter are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and have a typical QE » 10 %. Two previously unknown photoemissive materials have been discovered. These materials are compounds of potassium and tellurium, and of cesium, potassium and tellurium. The latter shows a QE = 23. 4 % in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Due to pollution and outgassing of alkali-metals, the QE of photo cathodes teadily decreases when they are used in the linear accelerator. It was found that the alkali-telluride-compounds have significantly larger lifetimes under operating conditions than their alkali-antimonide counterparts. The quality of the electron beam can be characterised by the emittance, which is a measure for the angular spread of the electrons. The lower the emittance, the better the quality of the beam. Several methods exist to measure this beam quality number. In Chapter 4, a comparison is made between the quadrupole scan, the pepper pot technique and phase space tomography. The longitudinal phase space of the electron beam is characterised by means of <b>treak</b> camera measurements and longitudinal phase space tomography. It is demonstrated that the duration of the electron bunch depends on the bunch charge. At a charge of 1. 5 nC the bunch length is 38 ps and the energy spread is 0. 4 %. These measurements are combined with the emittance measurements to yield a value for the brightness of the electron beam. A comparison of the brightness with that obtained with other accelerators shows that the electron beam that is used in the TEU-FEL experiment is one of the brightest beams in the world. In Chapter 5, lasing of TEU-FEL is demonstrated by simultaneously measuring the electron energy spectrum and the free electron laser output power. An increase in output energy is accompanied by a decrease in mean electron energy and a profound increase in energy spread. This indicates a energy transfer from the electron beam to the laser beam, thus confirming laser operation. The effect of de-tuning the free electron laser cavity has been investigated; the desynchronism curve is seen to be asymmetric, a result that is in agreement with that found by other workers in the field. Finally, the wavelength spectrum of the free electron laser is measured by making a Fourier transform of the results of a Michelson interferometer scan. The spectrum shows three prominent peaks (see cover) spaced approximately 9 mm apart. The occurrence of these different wavelengths is attributed to the difference in phase velocity between the modes in the resonator waveguide. There is good agreement with the theoretically predicted wavelength difference...|$|R
