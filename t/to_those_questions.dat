There was no answer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> nor has there ever been yet. So I thought and thought and {{wrestled}} in thought. What can I do {{to ease the pain}} of father, mother, brother, sister, sweetheart, wife and friend? Quietly and gradually there came out of the mist of thought this answer clear and strong, [...] "Let this body – this symbol of him – be carried reverently over the sea to his native land". And I was happy for about five or ten minutes." ...|$|E

(The one {{excuse for}} {{the act of}} personation--if excuse there could be--lay in the affirmative answer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions.</b> It would be something, surely, to say of the false Grace that the true Grace {{could not have been}} worthier of her welcome, if the true Grace had been {{received}} at Mablethorpe House!) ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went back}} {{for the third time}} to my desk. The one person who might be trusted to find the answer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> was Mr. Playmore. I wrote him a full and careful account of all that had happened; I begged him to forgive and forget my ungracious {{reception}} of the advice which he had so kindly offered to me; and I promised beforehand to do nothing without first consulting his opinion in the new emergency which now confronted me.|$|E
60|$|But in {{the case}} of Herodotus it will be more {{instructive}} to pass on from points like these <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> of general probability, the true apprehension of which depends rather on a certain quality of mind than on any possibility of formulated rules, questions which form no unimportant part of scientific history; for it must be remembered always that the canons of historical criticism are essentially different from those of judicial evidence, for they cannot, like the latter, be made plain to every ordinary mind, but appeal to a certain historical faculty founded on the experience of life. Besides, the rules for the reception of evidence in courts of law are purely stationary, while the science of historical probability is essentially progressive, and changes with the advancing spirit of each age.|$|E
6000|$|As things stood, at present, {{no answer}} <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> {{was to be}} hoped for from anybody in the house. Mr. Franklin {{appeared}} to think it a point of honour to forbear repeating to a servant--even to so old a servant as I was--what Miss Rachel had said {{to him on the}} terrace. Mr. Godfrey, who, as a gentleman and a relative, had been probably admitted into Mr. Franklin's confidence, respected that confidence as he was bound to do. My lady, who was also in the secret no doubt, and who alone had access to Miss Rachel, owned openly that she could make nothing of her. [...] "You madden me when you talk of the Diamond!" [...] All her mother's influence failed to extract from her a word more than that.|$|E

60|$|At Eyethorne {{many letters}} {{had come to}} them all. Letters from Arthur Eden, who spoke of {{returning}} soon from Continental wanderings, and of coming down to see his sister in the country. And from Captain Horton, also to Fan, with one at last to Mary, begging them {{to allow him to}} come down from London to spend a few days with them. And from Mr. Northcott to Constance--letters full of friendliest feeling, no longer resented, and of some speculative matter; for these two had discovered an infinite number of deep questions that called for discussion. <b>To</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> that concerned the spirit and were of first importance, the first place was given; but there were also worldly affairs to correspond about, for Constance had sent her manuscript to the curate for his opinion, and he had kept it some time to get another (more impartial) opinion, and now wished to submit it to a publisher. He had also expressed the intention of visiting Eyethorne shortly.|$|E

The sailors mark him; {{more and more}} certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they all-outward to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. 'What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> but likewise another {{answer to a question}} not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. The {{answer to}} every {{question}} {{which it is}} possible to frame, must be contained in a Proposition, or Assertion. Whatever can be an object of belief, or even of disbelief, must, when put into words, assume the form of a proposition. All truth and all error lie in propositions. What, by a convenient misapplication of an abstract term, we call a Truth, means simply a True Proposition; and errors are false propositions. To know the import of all possible propositions would be to know all questions which can be raised, all matters which are susceptible of being either believed or disbelieved. How many kinds of inquiries can be propounded; how many kinds of judgments can be made; and how many kinds of propositions {{it is possible to}} frame with a meaning, are but different forms of one and the same question. Since, then, the objects of all Belief and of all Inquiry express themselves in propositions, a sufficient scrutiny of Propositions and of their varieties will apprise us what questions mankind have actually asked of themselves, and what, in the nature of answers <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> they have actually thought they had grounds to believe.|$|E

6000|$|It {{should be}} {{especially}} noted that all which is here claimed is now almost universally admitted, while the criticisms of Darwin's works refer almost exclusively <b>to</b> <b>those</b> numerous <b>questions</b> which, {{as he himself}} says, [...] "will long remain obscure." ...|$|R

60|$|Such was his countenance {{in point}} of form; but in that which is the outward {{assertion}} of our immortality--in expression--it was, as I now beheld it, an utter void. Never had I before seen any human face which baffled all inquiry like his. No mask {{could have been made}} expressionless enough to resemble it; and yet it looked like a mask. It told you nothing of his thoughts, when he spoke: nothing of his disposition, when he was silent. His cold grey eyes gave you no help in trying to study him. They never varied from the steady, straightforward look, which was exactly the same for Margaret as it was for me; for Mrs. Sherwin as for Mr. Sherwin--exactly the same whether he spoke or whether he listened; whether he talked of indifferent, or of important matters. Who was he? What was he? His name and calling were poor replies <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions.</b> Was he naturally cold and unimpressible at heart? or had some fierce passion, some terrible sorrow, ravaged the life within him, and left it dead for ever after? Impossible to conjecture! There was the impenetrable face before you, wholly inexpressive--so inexpressive that it did not even look vacant--a mystery for your eyes and your mind to dwell on--hiding something; but whether vice or virtue you could not tell.|$|E
