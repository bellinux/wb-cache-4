The models are used to investigate how a <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> impacts the harmonic content of the machine. These models can thus be a powerful tool {{in order to identify}} a specific behavior caused by the fault, which can be further utilized for fault detection and/or condition monitoring applications. It is shown that, due to the fault condition, the amplitude of the harmonics in the back-EMF changes compared with the pre-fault conditions; the amplitude change is dependent on the number or short-circuited turns in the winding. If a reduced number of short-circuited turns are considered (as typically the case {{at the beginning of the}} fault and as considered in this paper), the harmonic amplitude change is comparatively small and therefore difficult to detect. It is shown that a more powerful indication of the <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> is to monitor the current harmonic content in the rotating reference frame, where new harmonics are introduced due to the unbalance caused by the <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault...</b>|$|E

40|$|A power {{transformer}} {{is one of}} the most important and expensive components in any power system. Power transformers can be exposed to a wide variety of abnormal conditions and <b>faults.</b> Internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults</b> are the most difficult types of faults to detect within the {{power transformer}}. The IEEE Standards documents have revealed that there is no one standard way to protect all power transformers against minor internal <b>faults</b> such as <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults</b> and at the same time to satisfy basic protection requirements: sensitivity, selectivity, and speed. This thesis presents a new, simple and efficient protection technique which is based on negative sequence currents. Using this protection technique, it is possible to detect minor internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults</b> in power transformers. Also, it can differentiate between internal and external faults. The discrimination is achieved by comparing the phase shift between two phasors of total negative sequence current. The new protection technique is being studied via an extensive simulation study using PSCAD®/EMTDC™ 1 software in a three-phase power system and is also being compared with a traditional differential algorithm. Relay performance under different numbers of shorted turns of the power transformer, different connections of the transformer, different values of the fault resistances, and different values of the system parameters was investigated. The results indicate that the new technique can provide a fast and sensitive approach for identifying minor internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults</b> in power transformers...|$|R

40|$|Transformers are {{essential}} and {{important elements of}} power systems. In the past few years, {{there has been an}} increasing concern about the occurrence of turn-to-turn faults in power transformers due to the high costs that unexpected outages cause. It is not always possible to analyze the transformer behavior under such faults under rated conditions, since the tests are largely destructive. Therefore, in order to avoid severe damage to machines, models are used for the analysis. Thus, many attempts were made to develop a more accurate method to compute the fault currents, among which Finite Element Method (FEM) -based approaches are the most accurate. Unfortunately, the time taken to model and solve by such methods is more, especially when the number of elements considered are more. This tempts the designer to think of an accurate and quickest method of evaluation of fault currents. One such method is presented in this article. Here, a field-based method is proposed for the analysis of internal winding faults of a Power transformer. The transformer with <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> is modeled using an analytical method based on the concept of “Application of Double Fourier Series for irregular flux distribution ” [1].

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years the number of {{renewable}} energy installations has shown a strong increase rate. Due to the ambition to close down fossil and nuclear power plants, this rate of increase is not expected to decline during the coming decades. In particular, wind energy represents one of the most dominant renewable energy sources. Due to the fact that wind energy has become such an important source of electric power, stable operation as well as high availability is needed. With the increasing amount of installations and the increase in power ratings of the single turbines, the task of maximizing the operational time of the wind turbine is more and more important {{in order to reduce the}} cost of energy. Under this scenario, early detection of fault conditions can be important to minimize the damage and therefore reduce the downtime of the wind turbine. It is therefore important to understand the behavior of the faulty component, both in order to limit the damage, but also to be able to more efficiently detect the fault. This work presents a system model of the electrical parts of a full power converter wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous machine as generators. The system model is modular based, where each sub-system can be replaced by a model of a faulty component in order to study its impact on a system level. Statistics has shown that faults occur in all of the different sub-systems of the turbine, not only in the electrical parts. However, generator faults are among the most common wind turbine component to fail, and in addition it is a costly and time consuming component to replace. This work presents an analytical model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine with a <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault,</b> which is the most common winding fault. There are other works available in this subject, however there is little information regarding how to detect a <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault.</b> The derived analytical model of the faulty machine is verified using a finite element model. In order to simulate the transition of the generator from healthy to faulty conditions, a flexible model of the permanent magnet synchronous machine is developed. The flexible model can also be used to emulate the evolvement of the fault by using a variable resistance in the fault loop of the investigated winding. The developed model can also be used to understand which quantities that needs to be monitored to be able to early detect a faulty condition in the machine. It is shown that turn-to-turn faults in the permanent magnet synchronous generator can be detected through monitoring of the harmonic content of the stator current in the rotating reference frame as the harmonic content slightly change when a turn-to-turn-fault arise...|$|E
40|$|A new fault {{diagnosis}} {{scheme based on}} the monitoring of main air gap flux of squirrel cage induction motors is proposed. Most of the existing flux monitoring techniques {{are based on the}} leakage or stray flux measurement outside of the motor. A few methods, however, use the main air gap flux as the fault signature, where search coils are used to monitor the derivative of the flux, which eventually introduces noise in the signal. Moreover, the diagnosis methods are mainly based on detecting a fault, whereas very little initiative has been taken to locate a fault precisely. To address these problems, a sophisticated yet robust condition monitoring and {{fault diagnosis}} method is needed. To this aim, we propose to monitor the main air gap flux using Hall Effect Flux Sensors (HEFS) at all the stator slots of an induction motor, which can be used to address the stator and rotor slot effects not only through frequency analysis of the magnetic flux, but also by magnitude and phase shift comparison of sensors located at different geometric positions around the stator. We have successfully detected the stator <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> at a very incipient stage and detected the location of the fault precisely.

The paper describes the usage of the negative-sequence currents in order to both detect and positively determine {{the position of the}} fault with respect to the protected zone, and thus avoid some typical weaknesses of the power transformer differential protection. Some examples of these are long delays for heavy internal faults, unwanted operations for external faults, and insensitivity to low-level <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults,</b> which can be left to develop into high-level faults – with more severe damage to the power transformer – before they can be detected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – It is {{objective}} and practical for an elec-tric machinery and apparatus test to computerize its diagnosis process with fault location identification. It {{is possible to}} recognize a fault location from measured voltage and current information by using a Kohonen’s self-organizing map (SOM) which only needs a learn-ing process of relation between the locations and their voltage and current characteristics. Diagnosis meth-ods for some types of apparatus are proposed by us-ing the SOM. First a diagnosis method for a three-phase PWM inverter which may have a switch fault is proposed. Twelve types of switch fault patterns are analyzed for its DC and harmonic components which are used as input data for their diagnosis map. The method is also applied to a multi-level, for example, three-level inverter. Secondly a diagnosis method of a linear induction motor which may have a turn or a <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> is proposed. Diagonal impedance for all fault cases under considerations are used for the SOM learning process and they are checked for their fault detections. Finally a diagnosis method for an in-duction machine which may have a turn fault is pro-posed. An impedance, which is a small slip-dependent term and expresses the degree of motor asymmetry, is computed from two sets of applied input voltages and currents and used as SOM input data. A simple mathematical model of an induction motor with the reference frame transformation is investigated.

40|$|During {{the course}} of a transformer's {{operational}} life, it experiences many challenges to its insulation. Chemical stresses, such as moisture in insulating oil, deteriorate insulation chemically. Mechanical stresses and thermal stresses, such as those experienced during a large external fault, also contribute to weakening a transformer's insulation. Once these stresses have weakened the insulation to the point of breakdown, a fault may occur between windings of the transformer. These faults, known as turn-to-turn faults, are difficult to detect electrically at the terminals of the transformer until they have grown to the point of damaging the transformer beyond repair. Current differential transformer protection is a simple, reliable, and cost effect method of detecting turn-to-turn faults. This method of protection is only able to detect faults involving 10 % of the windings or more. The sensitivity of current differential protection is limited as not to cause false tripping due to normal imbalances in current. Such imbalances in current may occur when a tapchanger is used to increase or decrease the voltage {{on one side of the}} transformer. Digital current differential relays, which monitor tap changer position, compensate for current imbalances due to tapchanger operation. Other causes of current imbalance include current transformer saturation, magnetizing inrush current, and over-excitation. A transformer is designed to operate continuously at 10 % above its rated voltage. In this overexcited state, a current imbalance appears which causes a differential current to be sensed by the current differential relay. This limits the current differential relay's sensitivity as it must be designed to ignore current imbalances due to the aforementioned causes. The current differential transformer protection algorithm, which only makes use of the current magnitude, is based on the principles of an electromechanical relay. Digital relays are capable of computing the negative sequence current on both primary and secondary sides of the transformer along with the phase difference between these two negative sequence currents. By using both phase and magnitude information, negative sequence current could be used to detect turn-to-turn faults involving 3 % of the transformer's windings or more. Turn-to-turn faults may still occur even if no current is flowing on one side of the transformer, such as during energization. With no current flowing in the secondary windings of the transformer, negative sequence current based algorithms become insensitive. A transformer is particularly likely to experience a <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> during this time due to the stresses of energization. This thesis introduces a relay prototype, using both negative sequence current and negative sequence voltage, which retains its sensitivity during energization. This prototype was constructed using a micro-controller and an analog-to-digital conversion board. The transformer protection relay algorithm, including all hardware interface code and signal processing code, was then designed to suit the prototype's hardware. A 3 -phase transformer real-time simulation model, capable of simulating turn-to-turn faults as well as the magnetic properties of the transformer's core, was developed. The voltage and current waveforms generated by the transformer model, running in the real-time simulator, were used to test the relay prototype. The sensitivity and speed of the relay algorithm proposed in this thesis was then tested, for faults involving 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the windings along with two commonly encountered transformer winding configurations. The relay's performance for several commonly encountered system scenarios such as over-excitation, current transformer saturation, non-zero fault resistance, transformer energization, and external faults were also examined for several <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>fault</b> severities. A fault resistance of one Ohm is typical for transformer turn-to-turn faults. These test results were compared to current differential protection with second harmonic restraint. The experimental results presented in this work indicate that the algorithm proposed in this thesis is faster and more sensitive than restrained current differential protection and capable of detecting turn-to-turn faults occurring during transformer energization...|$|E

Synchronous motors represent large investments and typically drive processeswhere downtime results in significant capital losses. Thus, detecting faults atan early stage can help avoid catastrophic failures and be useful in thescheduling of maintenance. In order to detect faulty conditions before theyterminate in a failure, machine operators must perform some kind ofmonitoring on the machines.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{how to provide}} standardized, current based, differential protection for any three-phase power transformer, including phase-shifting transformers with variable phase angle shift and transformers of all construction types and internal on-load tap-changer configurations. The use of standard transformer differential protection for such applications is considered impossible in the protective relaying standards and practices currently applied. The {{first part of the}} thesis provides the background for different types of power transformers and the differential protection schemes currently applied. After that a complete mathematical proof for the new, universal transformer differential protection principle, based on theory of symmetrical components, is derived. It is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} make numerical differential protection relays which can properly calculate differential currents for any power transformer, regardless of whether it is of fixed or variable phase angle shift construction and whether current magnitude variations are caused by on-load tapchanger(s). It is shown how to correctly calculate differential currents by simultaneously providing on-line compensation for current magnitude variations, on-line compensation for arbitrary phase angle shift variations and settable zero-sequence current reduction on any power transformer side. By using this method differential protection for arbitrary power transformers will be ideally balanced for all symmetrical and nonsymmetrical through-load conditions and external faults. The method is independent of individual transformer winding connection details (i. e. star, delta or zigzag), but dependent on having the correct information about actual on-load tap-changer(s) position if they are built-in within the protected power transformer. The implementation and practical use of this new universal principle is quite simple, as all necessary transformer data is commonly available on the protected power transformer rating plate. Practical application of the universal method for the differential protection of standard transformers, special transformers and phase shifting transformer is presented. Detailed testing of this new universal differential protection method is given and it is based on actual field recordings captured by numerical relays in existing phase-shifting transformer installations and on simulations from the Real Time Digital Simulator for a practical dual-core, symmetrical phaseshifting transformer. The implementation of the universal transformer differential method for analogue and numerical transformer differential relays is also described. Problems for the differential protection caused by transformer inrush currents are discussed. The mathematical relationship between differential protection and directional protection is derived. Then it is shown that through the addition of supplementary directional criteria security and speed of the operation of the transformer differential protection can be improved. Finally, the use of additional directional criteria to significantly improve the sensitivity of the differential protection for transformer winding <b>turn-to-turn</b> <b>faults</b> is suggested. Captured disturbance files from numerical differential relays in actual power transformer installations, during internal and external faults, have been used to demonstrate the performance of additional directional criteria...|$|R
