The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> and scores in each event.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} him <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> recorded by American boys {{of the same}} age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times,</b> which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E
50|$|In Time Attack mode, {{the player}} races through 5 laps {{on a single}} track to try and beat <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> possible. <b>The</b> player can play alone or against a ghost racer. A {{scoreboard}} of <b>the</b> top five <b>best</b> <b>times</b> for each track is displayed on the track selection screen, along with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> for a single lap. After getting <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> player can choose to save his/her ghost to race against later, though only one ghost can be saved at a time.|$|R

50|$|In the heats, each {{competitor}} had two runs; the 10 {{teams with}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> qualified for <b>the</b> semi-finals. Each semi-final consisted of one run each and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> six {{qualified for the}} final. The final saw one run each where the team with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> won <b>the</b> gold medal.|$|R
25|$|Qualifying {{is split}} into two sessions, both of which being 45 minutes. One session was held on 19 November and another was held on 20 November, with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> of each driver {{counting}} towards the grid for the qualifying race.|$|E
25|$|The Mayan Temple is {{the grand}} icon of Aquaventure, with {{a height of}} over six stories. The {{structure}} features a series of water rides, including the Leap of Faith, a 60-foot near-perpendicular plunge that sends riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon. Also located atop the Mayan Temple are the Challenger Slides, two high-speed dueling slides where riders race against the clock for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times.</b> From just below, the Serpent Slide spins out from 48 feet up the Temple and into the Temple's dark core before emerging through the shark-filled lagoon at a more leisurely “shark-viewing” pace. For a milder change of pace, the Jungle Slide meanders through exotic jungles and caves built {{in the heart of}} the Mayan Temple.|$|E
25|$|Hill ran <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> of {{her career}} in 1996. These {{included}} times of 6.69 seconds for the 55m, 7.21 seconds for the 60m indoors, and 22.49 seconds for the 200m outdoors. The 1996 United States Olympic Trials saw her improve her 100m best four times consecutively, recording 11.00 seconds in the first round, 10.99 seconds in the next round, 10.97 seconds in the semi-final, before crossing the line in 10.92 seconds to place third in the final. Working with LSU coach Dennis Shaver, she placed her improvements down to her being in a competitive training group, which included hurdler Kim Carson, and sprinters Sheila Echols and Zundra Feagin. Her place at the trials earned her selection for the United States at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Despite her {{being one of the}} three individual 100m runners (alongside Gail Devers and Gwen Torrence), she was not picked for the relay team on the basis of her being a straight-away specialist (positions occupied by the more favoured Devers and Torrence). At the 1996 Atlanta Games she reached the semi-finals of the 100m, but failed to improve in that round and was eliminated in sixth position.|$|E

Domenico Pozzovivo (Ag2r-La Mondiale) came to the finish with a fifteen-second deficit. Daniele Bennati (Tinkoff-Saxo) had the best intermediate time all day, which was calculated with [...] remaining as the riders went through the checkpoint.|$|E
500|$|Marojejy National Park is {{open all}} year, with Bradt Travel Guides recommending April to May and September to December as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> to visit due to less rainfall. [...] The park {{is one of}} the only {{national}} parks in Madagascar offering wooden chalets or bungalows, in addition to having a kitchen and toilet facilities at each of its three main camps inside a primary rainforest. [...] The housing provides beds and basic bedding, while the kitchen and eating areas are covered and offer basic cooking utensils. [...] These three camps have basic tent sites for campers. [...] Tent campsites are also offered outside the park, while the only other overnight accommodations outside the park are in Andapa and Sambava. [...] The park is unable to accommodate large groups. [...] Because of the rugged terrain and variable temperatures, the Bradt Travel Guide also recommended advanced planning for visiting the park.|$|E
500|$|Persona 4 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from game critics upon release. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb {{described it as}} [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> I've had with video games, whether I was playing by myself or watching someone else play it." [...] Famitsu pointed out that while [...] "there isn't much new from the last game", it favored the changes over the battle system, where the pacing [...] "is quick so it doesn't {{get to be a}} pain", and the ability to control party members [...] "makes play that much easier". IGN on the other hand noted that [...] "the pacing can be somewhat off", and [...] "some things feel repurposed or unaffected from previous games", while praising the game as an [...] "evolution of the RPG series, and an instant classic". It also noted that the soundtrack can be [...] "a bit repetitive". RPGFan's Ryan Mattich recommended Persona 4 as [...] "one of the best RPG experiences of the year", noting that [...] "among the cookie-cutter sequels and half-hearted remakes", the game is [...] "a near flawless example of the perfect balance between 'falling back on what works' and 'pushing the genre forward'." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch summarized Persona 4 as [...] "some of this decade's finest RPG epics", although the reviewer criticized its [...] "slight loading issues" [...] and the time spent [...] "waiting for the plot to advance". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.3, stating it's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role-playing genre, and that it stands out of any other JRPG, including its predecessor, Persona 3. Wired pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, [...] "the clever art style makes up for that". It also praised the game's soundtrack as [...] "excellent, especially the battle music".|$|E

500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E

The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should have something like it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did." [...] - Helen Forrest (circa 1982) ...|$|E

2500|$|Reid was Wainwright's {{personal}} {{choice for the}} role of Celia, describing the actress as [...] "so down to earth and compelling to watch".

She hoped that Last Tango in Halifax would [...] "give hope to older people", opining that the relationship between Celia and Alan was free from ageism. Reid identified herself with Celia's personality— believing herself to be quite reckless and outgoing— though stated that unlike her character she has no desire to enter another relationship. She enjoyed working with her friend Sarah Lancashire, who previously played her onscreen daughter in Rose and Maloney, [...] and suggested that the two share similar looks.
