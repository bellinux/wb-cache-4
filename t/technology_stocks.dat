40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relationships}} among oil prices, clean energy <b>stock</b> prices, and <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> prices, endogenously controlling for structural changes in the market. To this end, we apply Markov-switching vector autoregressive models to the economic system consisting of oil prices, clean energy and <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> prices, and interest rates. The results indicate {{that there was a}} structural change in late 2007, a period in which there was {{a significant increase in the}} price of oil. In contrast to the previous studies, we find a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices after structural breaks.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of {{investment}} process for a technology innovator {{in a market}} environment is designed. The "light" dynamics of the active innovator is described by the system of exponential trajectories in which one can quickly change growth parameters. It is assumed that the innovator operates in the inert market environment which can be presented by "heavy" exponential trajectories. The growth parameters of the market trajectories vary slowly and can be identified to some accuracy in the dynamic process of econometric observation basing on information of the current <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> (the average market <b>technology</b> <b>stock)</b> and its rate (the average market technology rate). The model consists of three decision making levels for dynamical identification, optimization of the commercialization time and optimal control design. On the first level the innovator makes assessment for the current commercialization time using econometric characteristics of {{the current level of}} the market <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> and the market technology rate. Since the market environment is inert and its acceleration (the second derivative) is small then information about the market <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> (current position) and the market technology rate (current first derivative) gives an opportunity to estimate exponential parameters of the market growth trajectories, to forecast the market commercialization time and indicate its sensitivity. On the second level the innovator optimizes its commercialization time basing on its own current <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> and taking into account the forecast of the market commercialization time. Two scenarios are possible for the innovator: the "slow" scenario with "large" time of innovation is oriented on the local extremum with usual level of sales of invented products, the "fast" scenario with "small" time of innovation maximizes the early level of innovation with bonus sales due to the market overtaking. On the third level the innovator solves an optimization problem for the investment policy basing on information about the chosen scenario, the commercialization time, and the difference between the achieved <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> and the demanded <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> for starting commercialization. Dynamical optimality principles for optimizing discounted innovation costs on investment trajectories are used for finding the optimal investment plan and designing optimal feedback for its realization. Properties of sensitivity and robustness are investigated for the optimal profit result and innovation feedbacks. ...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{security}} issues coupled with increased {{concern over the}} natural environment are driving factors behind oil price movements. While it is widely accepted that rising oil prices are good for the financial performance of alternative energy companies, there has been relatively little statistical work done to measure just how sensitive the financial performance of alternative energy companies are to changes in oil prices. In this paper, a four variable vector autoregression model is developed and estimated in order to investigate the empirical relationship between alternative energy <b>stock</b> prices, <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> prices, oil prices, and interest rates. Our results show <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> prices and oil prices each individually Granger cause the stock prices of alternative energy companies. Simulation results show that a shock to <b>technology</b> <b>stock</b> prices has a larger impact on alternative energy stock prices than does a shock to oil prices. These results should be of use to investors, managers and policy makers. ...|$|R

While some clusters benefit from cluster-specific foreign presence and <b>technology</b> <b>stock,</b> a more commonly observed pattern is that domestic firms in a cluster gain from the presence of foreign firms in other clusters {{of the region and}} region-specific <b>technology</b> <b>stock.</b> ...|$|R

Financial structure, however, {{does not appear to}} have any significant relationship with ICT development. The conclusions of the paper highlight the role of financial development in the market for knowledge-based products, and are consistent with theoretical predictions. The finding that financial development is an important determinant of ICT development implies that countries with underdeveloped financial markets may continue to lag behind in the use of ICT.
