5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E
5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life,</b> among many others. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|Chastain {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} drama Jolene (2008), and gained wide {{recognition}} in 2011 for starring roles in half a dozen films, including the dramas Take Shelter and <b>The</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life.</b> Her performance as an aspiring socialite in The Help earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. In 2012, she won a Golden Globe Award and received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for playing a CIA agent in the thriller Zero Dark Thirty. Chastain made her Broadway debut in a revival of The Heiress in the same year. Her highest-grossing releases came with the science-fiction films Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015), and she continued to draw praise for her performances in the dramas The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013), A Most Violent Year (2014), and Miss Sloane (2016).|$|E
5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields. The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of {{the events in the}} killing fields of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter and <b>The</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life,</b> gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E

5|$|The {{cladistic}} method (or cladism) {{has emerged}} since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley {{used the term}} clade. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks. A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are called polyphyletic. The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode is intended to regulate the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.|$|E
5|$|The film's locations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal sound stage. Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The Fountain in a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored reflective material, which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, and with the other materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the surface, the party encounters {{the army of}} the elven city of Suldanessellar. The elves cannot return to the city, for Irenicus has magically hidden it. To gain access to it, the party secures the Rhynn Lanthorn from Bodhi, who has stolen the artifact; upon Bodhi's death, Imoen's soul is restored. The Rhynn Lanthorn lights the way to Suldanessellar, which has been invaded by Irenicus and his minions. The party proceeds through the city and, at <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life,</b> learns that Irenicus is draining the power of the Tree, which will doom Suldanessellar. The heroes defeat him, but because Irenicus still has the protagonist's soul, the protagonist is dragged with the wizard into Hell, {{and the rest of the}} party are dragged along also. When they defeat Irenicus, they return to life and are honored by the elves of Suldanessellar.|$|E
