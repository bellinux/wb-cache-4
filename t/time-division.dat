25|$|A <b>time-division</b> subswitch reads a {{complete}} cycle of time slots into a memory, and then writes {{it out in}} a different order, also under control of a cyclic computer memory. This causes some delay in the signal.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the {{multiple}} working system {{was replaced with}} a new system based on <b>time-division</b> multiplexing (TDM) allowing 87s {{to work with other}} classes of locomotive (including most 86s, 90s and 91s) and most importantly, Driving Van Trailers (DVTs).|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{telephone network}} (PSTN) is generally limited to narrowband audio by the intrinsic {{nature of its}} transmission technology, TDM (<b>time-division</b> multiplexing), and by the analogue-to-digital converters used {{at the edge of}} the network, as well as the speakers, microphones and other elements in the endpoints themselves.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} {{innovation and}} avoid foreign intellectual property China {{has been developing}} indigenous technical standards. One example is the TD-SCDMA 3G standard. Critics have seen it as costly and delaying 3G introduction while supporters argue that it has increased technical abilities and experience which has increased Chinese competitiveness regarding 4G. Long-Term Evolution <b>Time-Division</b> Duplex is being implemented as China's indigenous 4G standard.|$|E
25|$|Muxponder: The muxponder (from {{multiplexed}} transponder) {{has different}} names depending on vendor. It essentially performs some relatively simple <b>time-division</b> multiplexing of lower-rate signals into a higher-rate carrier {{within the system}} (a common example {{is the ability to}} accept 4 OC-48s and then output a single OC-192 in the 1,550nm band). More recent muxponder designs have absorbed more and more TDM functionality, in some cases obviating the need for traditional SONET/SDH transport equipment.|$|E
25|$|Open L1OC and {{restricted}} L1SC signals are centered at 1600.995MHz, and open L2OC {{and restricted}} L2SC signals are centered at 1248.06MHz, overlapping with GLONASS FDMA signals. Open signals L1OC and L2OC use <b>time-division</b> multiplexing to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase {{to the open}} signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as <b>time-division</b> multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between time slots. Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{telephone}} switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use {{a combination}} of space- and <b>time-division</b> switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of digital logic that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or time switch could be by itself.|$|E
2500|$|MIMO {{is often}} {{traced back to}} 1970s {{research}} papers concerning multi-channel digital transmission systems and interference (crosstalk) between wire pairs in a cable bundle: AR Kaye and DA George (1970), Branderburg and Wyner (1974), and W. van Etten (1975, 1976). Although these are not examples of exploiting multipath propagation to send multiple information streams, some of the mathematical techniques for dealing with mutual interference proved useful to MIMO development. In the mid-1980s Jack Salz at Bell Laboratories [...] took this research a step further, investigating multi-user systems operating over [...] "mutually cross-coupled linear networks with additive noise sources" [...] such as <b>time-division</b> multiplexing and dually-polarized radio systems.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{locomotive}} to {{be preserved}} was no. 86401 'Hertfordshire Rail Tours'. This locomotive was operated by EWS until 2002, when {{it was one of}} the final three EWS machines to be withdrawn from traffic. Prior to that, it was the only locomotive of its class to be painted in Network SouthEast livery, and was named 'Northampton Town'. In this guise it was used on London-Cambridge and London-Northampton passenger trains. In 2004, no. 86401 was preserved by the AC Locomotive Group, which also owns examples of Classes 81-85 (based at Barrow Hill Engine Shed). 86401 was initially deployed in the reserve fleet of operational shunting/depot service locomotives at Willesden TMD. In February 2015, 86401 moved from Willesden TMD to Leicester Depot where it underwent renovation work. Modifications that it had at Leicester Depot included the fitting of GSM-R and OTMR, the re-commissioning of the <b>Time-division</b> multiplexing system and various attention to the components and bodywork. On 12 May 2015, it left Leicester Depot bound for Brush Traction where it was re-painted into [...] "Caledonian Blue" [...] and newly named [...] "Mons Meg".|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, {{specifically}} in <b>time-division</b> multiplex (TDM) and <b>time-division</b> multiple access (TDMA) variants, a frame is a cyclically repeated data block {{that consists of}} a fixed number of time slots, one for each logical TDM channel or TDMA transmitter. In this context, a frame is typically an entity at the physical layer. TDM application examples are SONET/SDH and the ISDN circuit switched B-channel, while TDMA examples are the 2G and 3G circuit-switched cellular voice services. The frame is also an entity for <b>time-division</b> duplex, where the mobile terminal may transmit during some timeslots and receive during others.|$|E
50|$|A TDM bus is one {{application}} {{of the principle of}} <b>Time-Division</b> Multiplexing.|$|E
50|$|In {{its primary}} form, TDM {{is used for}} circuit mode {{communication}} with a fixed number of channels and constant bandwidth per channel. Bandwidth reservation distinguishes <b>time-division</b> multiplexing from statistical multiplexing such as statistical <b>time-division</b> multiplexing. In pure TDM, the time slots are recurrent in a fixed order and pre-allocated to the channels, rather than scheduled on a packet-by-packet basis.|$|E
50|$|UMTS-TDD, {{an acronym}} for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) - <b>time-division</b> {{duplexing}} (TDD), is a 3GPP standardized version of UMTS networks that use UTRA-TDD. UTRA-TDD is a UTRA that uses <b>time-division</b> duplexing for duplexing. While a full implementation of UMTS, it is mainly used to provide Internet access in circumstances similar to those where WiMAX might be used. UMTS-TDD is not directly compatible with UMTS-FDD: a device designed to use one standard cannot, unless specifically designed to, work on the other, because {{of the difference in}} air interface technologies and frequencies used. It is more formally as IMT-2000 CDMA-TDD or IMT 2000 <b>Time-Division</b> (IMT-TD).|$|E
