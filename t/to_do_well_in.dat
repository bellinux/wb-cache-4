5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the election.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the election.|$|E

In a 1922 lecture at Scottish Rite Auditorium, she commented, “Most people use less brains in selecting the person with whom they are to spend their lives than they do in choosing an automobile, a bicycle or a cut of steak. Love isn’t enough; there must also be understanding.” ...|$|R

5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the aerials, but both crashed and {{failed to make the}} final. Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned but finished last, in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|Quantico season one premiere {{garnered}} 7.14 {{million viewers}} and a 1.9 rating among adults 18–49, the highest-rated scripted telecast on Sunday night opposite Sunday Night Football.

The pilot episode was also popular for DVR playback (over five million, a 79-percent increase, for a total 3.4 rating among adults 18–49 and total viewership of 12.15million).

5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 {{season was}} the 132nd {{in the history}} of the franchise. After a disappointing 2013, the Phillies entered the offseason with a {{strategy}} to reload rather than rebuild; they did not want to relinquish the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> 2014 in hopes of being competitive down the road. Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were right fielder Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|With India's older players {{opting out}} of the inaugural World Twenty20, Pathan {{was one of several}} younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.|$|E

25|$|After the {{verdicts}} penalized numerous clubs, Palermo's overall position for that season was elevated to 5th, meaning they had {{qualified for the}} 2006–2007 UEFA Cup.

25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad.

25|$|Located {{along the}} Loire River {{near the town}} of Angers, the region of Anjou has a mild {{continental}} climate with some maritime influences due to its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.

Annual rainfall totals for the region usually hover around 19inches (500mm). The vineyard soils close to the Loire River are composed primarily of carboniferous rock and schist.
