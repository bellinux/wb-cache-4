5|$|Retrospectively, McDowell was {{impressed}} {{at how many}} people made {{the connection between the}} film's title and the star Betelgeuse. He added that <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers had received a suggestion the sequel be named Sanduleak-69 202 after the former star of SN 1987A.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, the Rover Hendrix act break joke {{has been}} {{called one of the}} worst jokes in The Simpsons history by <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed the Smashing Pumpkins' and Cypress Hill's {{performances}} among the 33 funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Cypress Hill his sixth-favorite musical guests on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
5|$|Chloe Sullivan {{has been}} {{characterized}} as independent, intelligent, curious and impulsive by both <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> the actress that portrays her. The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe {{to get into trouble}} with both her friends and with local industrialists Lionel Luthor and his son Lex, two of the show's primary antagonists. Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her portrayal of Chloe.|$|E
5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Jean and Reiss {{signed a}} three-year deal with The Walt Disney Company to produce other {{television}} shows for ABC, and the duo created and executive-produced Teen Angel, which was canceled {{in its first}} season. Jean returned full-time to The Simpsons during the tenth season (1998). He became showrunner again with {{the start of the}} thirteenth season in 2001, without Reiss, and has held that position since. Jean was also one of <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film based on the series, released in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> animators of Animaniacs {{used the}} {{experience}} {{gained from the}} previous series to create new animated characters that were cast in the mold of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery's creations. Additional writers for the series included Liz Holzman, Paul Rugg, Deanna Oliver, John McCann, Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, Tom Minton, and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} season, {{eight of the}} show's {{recurring}} guest stars are promoted to series regulars and credited just after the main titles and before <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers. They include Jan Levinson, Michael's main love interest and Vice-President of Regional Sales, who is portrayed by Melora Hardin; Roy Anderson, a warehouse worker and Pam's fiance played by David Denman; Angela Martin, Oscar Martinez, and Kevin Malone the office's accountants, portrayed by Angela Kinsey, Oscar Nunez, and Brian Baumgartner, respectively; Phyllis Lapin, portrayed by Phyllis Smith, and Stanley Hudson, portrayed by Leslie David Baker, who, along with Schrute and Halpert compose the sales division of Dunder Mifflin Scranton; and Meredith Palmer, played by Kate Flannery, the promiscuous Supplier Relations Representative.|$|E
5|$|Jean {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> {{producers}} who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film that was released in 2007. The show's voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers of The Simpsons were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect}} on the show, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the show progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast members}} were {{recruited}} from sketch and character comedy, having previously had roles in Gavin & Stacey, Peep Show, The Thick of It and The Mighty Boosh TV series among others. Several of <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> researchers also occasionally appeared {{in front of the}} camera, including Punt, Jenner, George Sawyer and Susie Donkin, while actors Mathew Baynton and Ben Willbond sometimes contributed to the writing. Laurence Rickard was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself part of both the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} comedy The Office premiered in the United States on NBC on September 27, 2007, and concluded on May 15, 2008. The season consisted of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying {{the daily lives of}} office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The season was interrupted and shortened due to the effects of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, in which <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> some actors of The Office went on strike; although 30 half-hour episodes had been ordered, only 19 were actually filmed. Several of the finished episodes were condensed into hour-long episodes, resulting in only 14 episodes being aired.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|X-Men: The Last Stand was {{released}} on October 3, 2006, on DVD and VHS. It was available in three editions: single-disc, two-disc, and a trilogy box set with the previous two films. Extras included three alternative endings, each with optional commentary by director Ratner; 10 deleted scenes; audio commentaries from Ratner, <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> the producers; and two hidden Easter eggs. The two-disc edition came with a 100-page commemorative comic book with a new story written by X-Men co-creator Stan Lee, his first original Marvel comic book in five years. The DVD sold 2.6 million units in its first day, exceeding Fox's expectations, and sold a total 5 million in its first week. A Blu-ray edition was issued in November 2006.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode, {{which was}} filmed {{over a period}} of 21 days, served as the basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>and</b> the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that {{there was no room for}} Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.|$|E
