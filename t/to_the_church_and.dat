5|$|The {{decaying}} priory {{was taken}} over by the Landmark Trust in 1969. In the subsequent 20 years restoration work was undertaken. Initially this was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> infirmary with the removal of ivy and removal and replacement of the roofs. The infirmary walls had to be held in place by a concrete ring beam.|$|E
5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> community. As per this commitment, he brought the University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park which had remained continually in operation after the loss of the Bronzeville campus through the Baptist Theological Union in Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E

5|$|William left Normandy to Robert, and {{the custody}} of England was given to William's second {{surviving}} son, also called William, {{on the assumption that}} he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> money to be distributed to the poor.

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought his head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket {{turned out to be}} extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} source for this period in Kentish history is The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Benedictine monk from Northumbria. Bede was primarily {{interested in the}} Christianization of England, but he also provides substantial information about secular history, including the reigns of Æthelberht and Eadbald. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. A series of related texts known as the Legend of St Mildrith provides additional information about events {{in the lives of}} Eadbald's children and throws some light on Eadbald himself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled in about 890 in the kingdom of Wessex, also provides information. Other sources include papal letters, regnal lists of the kings of Kent, and early charters. Charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to their followers or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> they provide some of the earliest documentary sources in England. None survive in original form from Eadbald's reign, but some later copies exist.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman conquest, William the Conqueror {{granted the}} Earldom of Lancaster to Roger de Poictou {{who in turn}} granted the barony of Widnes to Yorfrid. Yorfrid had no sons and his elder {{daughter}} married William FitzNigel, the second Baron of Halton. On Yorfrid's death the barony of Widnes passed to that of Halton. The current St. Luke's, a Norman church, was built in Farnworth. Its date of origin is uncertain but {{it is likely to}} be around 1180. In 1500 the South Chapel was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> in 1507 a grammar school was established in Farnworth; both were endowments from Bishop William Smyth. Until the middle of the 19th century the area consisted of the scattered hamlets of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton, Upton and Woodend. Nearby were the villages of Cronton and Cuerdley.|$|E

5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties {{to be carried out}} without interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> as a means of renewing contact with old friends.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals were opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> particularly opposed its influence {{in politics and}} society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political groups would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E

While Charlemagne's letter is respectful and even affectionate, it also exhibits his concept of the coordination of the spiritual and temporal powers, nor does he hesitate <b>to</b> remind <b>the</b> pope of his grave spiritual obligations.
