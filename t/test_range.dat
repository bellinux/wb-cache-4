5|$|While demonstrating {{excellent}} results, {{this campaign}} showed {{the need to}} change some of the aerodynamic features of the weapon. To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered dual-mode (laser- and GPS/INS-guided) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and Rafale fighter-bombers. The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9, 2008 after three firings at the DGA's missile <b>test</b> <b>range</b> in Biscarosse. This 250kg IR version performed a night launch from a Rafale fighter-bomber at DGA's Biscarosse <b>test</b> <b>range</b> in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 the hijacked 727-100 {{aircraft}} was sold by Northwest to Piedmont Airlines {{where it was}} re-registered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service. In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company Key Airlines, re-registered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between Nellis Air Force Base and the Tonopah <b>Test</b> <b>Range</b> during the top-secret F-117 Nighthawk development program.

5|$|From June 2000 until 21 April 2004, Tula {{underwent}} overhaul at the Zvezdochka shipyard, Severodvinsk, {{the third}} boat after Verkhoturie (K-51) and Ekaterinburg (K-84). The overhaul extended her service life by ten years, and {{allowed her to}} carry R-29RMU Sineva missiles. She conducted sea trials in early 2006 and re-entered service shortly thereafter, despite plans {{to do so in}} 2005. Tula post-overhaul operational history is characterised by a number of missile launches, the first of which occurred on 17 December 2007, when she launched a Sineva missile aimed at the Kura <b>Test</b> <b>Range</b> in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Within eight days, Tula launched another missile, again aimed at Kura; both tests were successful.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the region is the Záhorská nížina, a plain between the towns of Senica and Malacky. Most of the area is forested because its sandy subsoil is not {{suitable}} for farming. The forested area is used as a <b>testing</b> <b>range</b> for military vehicles, especially tanks and artillery. The <b>testing</b> <b>range</b> is called Vojenský technický skúšobný ústav Záhorie (the Záhorie Military Technical Testing Institute), and it contains the <b>testing</b> <b>range,</b> the Kuchyňa airbase and the village of Záhorie, which was built for workers at the <b>testing</b> <b>range.</b> Headquarters are located in the village of Záhorie and includes storage facilities and research facilities. The western edge of the region is formed by the river Morava. The eastern border is the Carpathian Mountain Range. On the north is the Chvojnická pahorkatina. The Myjava River flows through the region, and nearly every village has a dam or lake.|$|R

5|$|No. 20 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 April 2015 {{to support}} airfield operations at RAAF Base Woomera, South Australia. Consisting of nine uniformed personnel and one Australian Public Service member {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett, the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing, a component of Combat Support Group (CSG). The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of Aerospace Operational Support Group, but a command-and-control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that, in common with other RAAF airfields, it should be administered by CSG. RAAF Base Woomera, incorporating Woomera Village, was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the Woomera Range Complex, the other unit being RAAF Woomera <b>Test</b> <b>Range.</b>|$|E
5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic <b>Test</b> <b>Range,</b> to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E

He was present at the British Operation Hurricane nuclear test in the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia in October 1952, and then for Operation Totem tests at Emu Field in South Australia in October 1953. When the British government established the Maralinga <b>Test</b> <b>Range</b> in 1953, the Australian government created the Maralinga Safety Committee, which became the became the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee, with Martin as its chairman. As such he was responsible for safety of the Operation Mosaic tests at Monte Bello in May and June 1956, and Operation Buffalo tests at Maralinga in September and October 1956, after which he handed over the chairmanship to Ernest Titterton. An advocate for the peaceful use atomic energy, Martin {{became a member of the}} Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee in 1949, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in 1953. In 1958 he was an Australian delegate to the United Nations conference on Atoms for Peace in Vienna.
