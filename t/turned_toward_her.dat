500|$|Sydney {{closed to}} a {{distance}} of [...] before turning to a parallel course with Emden. The German cruiser opened fire first, and [...] the Australian vessel with her third salvo. Emdens gunners were firing rapidly, with a salvo every ten seconds; Müller hoped to overwhelm Sydney with a barrage of shells before her heavier armament could take effect. Two shells hit Sydney, one of which disabled the aft fire control station; the other failed to explode. It took slightly longer for Sydney to find the range, and in the meantime, Emden <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> opponent {{in an attempt to}} close to torpedo range. Sydneys more powerful [...] guns soon found the range and inflicted serious damage. The wireless compartment was destroyed and the crew for one of the forward guns was killed early in the engagement. At 09:45, Müller turned his ship toward Sydney in another attempt to reach a torpedo firing position. Five minutes later, a shell hit disabled the steering gear, and other fragments jammed the hand steering equipment. Emden could only be steered with her propellers. Sydneys gunfire also destroyed the rangefinders and caused heavy casualties amongst Emdens gun crews.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound {{on either side of her}} face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd {{like to see}} him try it!" [...] {{said the}} fat lady, with just a shade of anger in <b>her</b> voice. Then <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> husband, she said, emphatically, [...] "Samuel, don't you ever let me catch you {{swallowing}} a sword!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "May I inquire, first, if my name {{happens to}} be {{familiar}} to you?" [...] said Magdalen, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> {{as a matter of}} necessity, but coolly holding up her handkerchief at the same time between her face and the light.|$|R
5000|$|Leontion was {{reclining}} {{at dinner}} with a lover when Glycera came into the symposium later; and when the lover paid more devoted attention to her, Leontion looked downcast. <b>Her</b> friend, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her,</b> asked what pained her. She replied, [...] "The last comer gives me a pain!" ....|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Rogers!" [...] she exclaimed; and then, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> husband, {{seemed to}} refer {{the two men}} to each other. They shook hands, but Lapham did not speak. [...] "I didn't know you were in Boston," [...] pursued Mrs. Lapham. [...] "Is Mrs. Rogers with you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Princess Emma <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> tardy escort {{that had}} just arrived upon the scene.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed back}} the {{throttle}} on his steering-wheel {{and stopped the}} engine. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

60|$|Then he <b>turned</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>her,</b> thrust {{her hand}} from around his neck, and stood up.|$|R

6000|$|... "Here we are {{in sight}} of Mudport," [...] he said at last. [...] "Now, dearest," [...] he added, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> with a look that was half beseeching, [...] "the worst part of your fatigue is over.

6000|$|... "Squire Braile!" [...] {{she called}} to him, and as he {{straightened}} himself and <b>turned</b> round <b>toward</b> <b>her,</b> she besought him, [...] "Do you believe there's any God?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I know I did," [...] he admitted, [...] "and now I don't want to any more, do you see? It's this cursed {{place and}} this cursed life! One's feet seem {{always on the}} sands.

60|$|She {{was sitting}} at the table {{arranging}} the pages she was going to read, and at the question she <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> me. <b>Her</b> face was flushed, but not, I think, with displeasure.|$|R
60|$|I sat quite still. I {{felt that}} Eve's eyes were {{watching}} me. I set my teeth for a moment; and I <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her,</b> my cigarette case in my hand.|$|E
60|$|She woke when {{he rose to}} {{feed the}} fire, and the current of cold air which swept in caused her to cover her mouth with the blanket. He <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that the tact of the junior member of the firm {{asserted}} itself. Quietly laying down his pen, he <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>her,</b> and spoke for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny spoke fast, {{and laughed}} uncomfortably, {{as she went}} back to the sofa, {{wondering}} if Polly had told her a lie.

Well, you are mistaken, and the next time you want to know anything, please ask straight out. I like it better than talking at cross purposes." ...|$|R
60|$|The child <b>turned</b> inquiringly <b>toward</b> <b>her</b> mother, who met {{her with}} an indulgent smile, which became a little flush of {{grateful}} appreciation when it reached Colville; but Mrs. Bowen ignored Imogene in the matter altogether.|$|R
6000|$|They {{said they}} would.
