5|$|The Great Depression {{presented}} a unique time for film-making in the United States.

By the end of 1918, the bank had recovered and surpassed CHF 1billion in total assets and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920. The impact of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash</b> of 1929 and the Great Depression was severe, particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936.

Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E

5|$|The Rockefeller Center had {{originally}} been intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. {{to be a new}} location for the Metropolitan Opera House, but <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> brought an end to the scheme. Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession. At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.|$|E
50|$|On Tuesday, October 29, 1929, <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crashed,</b> {{leading to}} <b>the</b> Great Depression. U. S. vehicle {{production}} plummeted.

5|$|The {{prototype}} E850 named Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded slowly, at Maunsell’s insistence, {{to ensure that}} the weight was kept to a minimum at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 gallon 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 gallon 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash,</b> the nominee would {{have a good chance}} of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E

5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash</b> of 1987 {{and involvement in}} the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of {{several members of the}} board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most senior executives in an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's internal controls and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E
