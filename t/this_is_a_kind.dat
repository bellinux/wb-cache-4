25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of abstraction—in {{most cases the}} angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|E
25|$|In the pinyin (hànyǔ pīnyīn) {{system of}} romanization for Standard Chinese, an {{apostrophe}} is often loosely said to separate syllables {{in a word}} where ambiguity could arise. Example: the standard romanization {{for the name of}} the city Xī'ān includes an apostrophe to distinguish it from a single-syllable word xian. More strictly, however, it is correct to place an apostrophe only before every a, e, or o that starts a new syllable after the first if it is not preceded by a hyphen or a dash. Examples: Tiān'ānmén, Yǎ'ān; but simply Jǐnán, in which the syllables are ji and nan, since the absence of an apostrophe shows that the syllables are not jin and an (contrast Jīn'ān). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of morpheme-separation marking (see above).|$|E
25|$|The same {{as regular}} {{quicksort}} except the pivot {{is replaced by}} a buffer. First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer and sort them. Read the next element from the beginning or end to balance writing. If the next element is less than the least of the buffer, write it to available space at the beginning. If greater than the greatest, write it to the end. Otherwise write the greatest or least of the buffer, and put the next element in the buffer. Keep the maximum lower and minimum upper keys written to avoid resorting middle elements that are in order. When done, write the buffer. Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E
25|$|Tolls (tolgelden): Tolls {{were charged}} {{to cross the}} borders of most heerlijkheden. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of road toll (wegentol), but it also {{took the form of}} a charge on the {{transport}} of specific commodities (e.g. salt) or people.|$|R

[...] This means that the world lines of the nearest neighbors of each Langevin observer are twisting about its own world line, as suggested by Fig.nbsp&2.

2500|$|Hippias objects, {{saying that}} the laws punish people who harm others {{deliberately}} with purposeful lies, and {{are more apt to}} excuse those who do harm by making mistakes. [...] Socrates insists that those who injure people, tell deliberate lies, and err voluntarily are better than people who simply make mistakes (372d). Hippias suspects at this point that Socrates is being dishonest in the debate. [...] Socrates counters that if he is troublesome, it is unintentional, that if he were being difficult deliberately, then he would be wily, which he is not. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of liar's paradox.|$|E
50|$|In 1781, Bayard became {{head of the}} Board of War, and as such {{joined the}} state's Executive Council. Under Pennsylvania's 1776 {{constitution}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of combination of the roles of a governor's cabinet and the state Senate. Then in 1785 {{he was elected to}} the Congress of the Confederation, the successor of the Continental Congress. He served there in 1785 and 1786, attending their meetings in New York.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Spicer ran a {{workshop}} called Poetry as Magic at San Francisco State College, which {{was attended by}} Duncan, Helen Adam, James Broughton, Joe Dunn, Jack Gilbert, and George Stanley. He also participated in, and sometimes hosted, Blabbermouth Night at a literary bar called The Place. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of contest of improvised poetry and encouraged Spicer's view of poetry as being dictated to the poet.|$|R

2500|$|The simplest, but not {{necessarily}} most correct demarcation point of this era is {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union and the liberalisation of China in 1991. Francis Fukuyama wrote [...] "The End of History" [...] in 1989 in anticipation of the fall of the Berlin wall. He predicted that the question of political philosophy had been answered, that large scale wars over fundamental values would no longer arise since [...] "all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs satisfied." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of 'endism' also taken up Arthur Danto who in 1984 acclaimed that Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes asked the right question of art and hence art had ended.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{algorithm}} {{is a combination}} of radix sort and quicksort. Pick an element from the array (the pivot) and consider the first character (key) of the string (multikey). Partition the remaining elements into three sets: those whose corresponding character is less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot's character. Recursively sort the [...] "less than" [...] and [...] "greater than" [...] partitions on the same character. Recursively sort the [...] "equal to" [...] partition by the next character (key). Given we sort using bytes or words of length W bits, the best case is O(KN) and the worst case O(2KN) or at least O(N2) as for standard quicksort, given for unique keys N<2K, and K is a hidden constant in all standard comparison sort algorithms including quicksort. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition represents a (trivially) sorted subarray of elements that are exactly equal to the pivot.|$|E

50|$|Notable {{among his}} pursuits was {{the concept of}} the powder of sympathy. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of {{sympathetic}} magic; one manufactured a powder using appropriate astrological techniques, and daubed it, not on the injured part, but on whatever had caused the injury. His book on this salve went through 29 editions. Synchronising the effects of the powder, which apparently caused a noticeable effect on the patient when applied, was actually suggested in 1687 as a means of solving the longitude problem.|$|R

60|$|Cases of {{this kind}} are admirably {{described}} by Sir Charles Lyell. He speaks of {{the frequency with which}} geologists find in the chalk a fossilized sea-urchin, to which is attached the lower valve of a Crania. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of shell-fish, with a shell composed of two pieces, of which, as in the oyster, one is fixed and the other free.|$|E
50|$|Due to his renown {{he worked}} in various European {{countries}} in the following years, permanently returning to Venice in 1705. In Venice he started his own cosmographical project and published the volumes of Atlante Veneto. In his home city he founded the very first geographical society, the Accademia Cosmografica degli Argonauti. He also held the position of Cosmographer of the Republic of Venice. Later six volumes of the Biblioteca Universale Sacro-Profana were published by Coronelli. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of encyclopedia, its compiled entries were ordered alphabetically.|$|R
50|$|During <b>this</b> period, Corman <b>was</b> writing prolifically and {{published}} in excess of 500 poems in about 100 magazines by 1954. He considered <b>this</b> to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of apprenticeship, and none of these poems were ever published in book form.|$|R
50|$|The {{colouration}} {{especially of}} young A. klugii resembles the red hourglass marking of the Mediterranean black widow Latrodectus tredecimguttatus. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> probably <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of mimicry, {{to ward off}} predators that mistake the harmless animal for a venomous spider.|$|R
6000|$|Marianne {{looked at}} her steadily, and said, [...] "You know, Elinor, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of talking which I cannot bear.
