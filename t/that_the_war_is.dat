500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Du Bois was more determined {{than ever to}} gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers {{returning from}} overseas felt {{a new sense of}} power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the New Negro. In the editorial [...] "Returning Soldiers" [...] he wrote: [...] "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land." [...] Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer of 1919, a horrific series of race riots across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of The Crisis, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.|$|E
500|$|Conceived by Halsey, the SPARTAN-II {{program was}} {{secretly}} commissioned {{to create an}} elite corps of supersoldiers who could stem rebellion in the UNSC colonies; these soldiers became the best weapon against the alien Covenant when war broke out. While John-117, {{also known as the}} Master Chief, is the hero of the trilogy, other soldiers {{play a significant role in}} the novels, Halo Legends, and the prequel games Halo Wars and [...] To raise morale as the war continued to sour for humanity, the existence of the SPARTAN-II Program is disclosed to the general public. The Spartans become heroes and veritable legends; in order to maintain public confidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> going well, Spartans are never listed as killed, only as Missing in Action or Wounded in Action. The SPARTANS were kidnapped as children, who were replaced by flash clones, which died of natural causes afterwards. The physical augmentation they undergo to turn them into super soldiers is lengthy, expensive, and strenuous, with not all of them surviving the process. Both male and female SPARTANS average [...] tall. After being recruited into the UNSC, the Spartans' last name are disposed of; their callsign is simply their first name, and a corresponding 3-digit figure (for example, Alice-130, Douglas-042 etc).|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E
50|$|Almost no one {{denied the}} {{connection}} between the Afghanistan's Taliban government and al-Qaida. However, various leftists opposed the Afghanistan invasion and the subsequent invasion of Iraq on the following grounds: pacifism; belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> illegal under international law; opposition to perceived U.S. imperialism; disbelief (especially in the case of Iraq) in the sincerity of <b>the</b> U.S.'s stated <b>war</b> aims of counter-terrorism and the spread of political freedom; belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> <b>were</b> motivated by neocolonialism and petroleum politics; and, in a few cases, denial of al-Qaida's responsibility for the September 11 attacks.|$|R

500|$|After the film's release, {{there was}} {{criticism}} in Uganda of {{its failure to}} state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, [...] "It is totally misleading to suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> still in Uganda." [...] Arthur Larok, ActionAid's director in Uganda, said, [...] "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda. We have challenges within the country, but certainly the perception of a country at war is not accurate at all." [...] Dr Beatrice Mpora, director of a community health organization in Gulu, commented, [...] "There {{has not been a}} single soul from the LRA here since 2006. Now we have peace, people are back in their homes, they are planting their fields, they are starting their businesses. That is what people should help us with." [...] Prime Minister of Uganda Amama Mbabazi launched an online response on YouTube, in which he seeks to correct the [...] "false impression" [...] that Uganda is still at war, and invites everyone to visit the country, assuring that people would find it [...] "a very different place to that portrayed by Invisible Children". Meanwhile, dozens of members of Ugandan diaspora in United States protested outside the Invisible Children offices in San Diego, also criticizing the video but saying Kony represents [...] "only three percent of all the problems" [...] in their home country and lambasting the Ugandan government for its inadequate response to Kony's terror and other issues.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April 2009, {{the head}} of the Federal Security Service, Alexander Bortnikov, {{announced}} that they [...] "cancelled the decree imposing an anti-terror operation on the territory of, effective from midnight". According to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov the announcement means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> finished by their victory.

2500|$|The separatists deny <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> over, and {{guerrilla warfare}} {{continues}} throughout the North Caucasus. Colonel Sulim Yamadayev, Chechnya's second most powerful loyalist warlord after Kadyrov, also denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> over. In March 2007, Yamadayev claimed there were well over 1,000 separatists and foreign Islamic militants {{entrenched in the}} mountains of Chechnya alone: [...] "The war is not over, the war is far from being over. What we are facing now is basically a classic partisan war and my prognosis is that it will last two, three, maybe even five more years." [...] According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating [...] "while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues." [...] The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists.|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie is}} well known as the {{inspiration}} for [...] "Downfall parodies". One scene in the film, in which Hitler launches into a furious tirade upon finally realizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> lost, has become a staple of internet videos. In these videos, the original German audio is retained, but new subtitles are added so that Hitler and his subordinates seem to be reacting instead to some setback in present-day politics, sports, entertainment, popular culture, or everyday life. Other scenes from various portions of the film have been parodied in the same manner, including the scenes where Hitler orders Otto Günsche to find SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, where Hitler discusses a counterattack against advancing Soviet forces with his generals and where Goebbels vows to his generals that he will never surrender the city of Berlin to the Russians.|$|E
2500|$|The Scholls and Probst were {{scheduled}} to stand trial before the Volksgerichtshof— the Nazi [...] "People's Court" [...] infamous for its unfair political trials, which {{more often than not}} ended with a death sentence — on 22 February 1943. They were found guilty of treason. Roland Freisler, head judge of the court, sentenced them to death. The three were executed the same day by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison. All three were noted for the courage with which they faced their deaths, particularly Sophie, who remained firm despite intense interrogation, and intimidation by Freisler during the trial. She replied: [...] "You know as well as we do <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> lost. Why are you so cowardly that you won't admit it?" [...] Immediately before Hans was executed, he cried out [...] "Es lebe die Freiheit! - Long live freedom!", as the blade fell.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Andrey Illarionov, former {{advisor to}} Vladimir Putin, in his {{interview}} with Echo of Moscow declared that it was suspicious that the evacuation of almost entire South Ossetian population began on 2 August and was finished before the war, because this had not happened before during the past 20 years of the conflict during the escalations of tensions. After the evacuation of the civilian population, the mobilization of volunteers started in the North Caucasus. Illarionov stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> started with the mobilization. On 3 August the volunteers started to arrive in South Ossetia. Illarionov noted that all the volunteers were registered in the Military commissariats of North Caucasus republics and were organized. On 4 August, several Russian special forces were deployed in South Ossetia. Illarionov also noted that since the late July the Ossetian media was reporting {{that the war was}} imminent and that Russian 58th Army would help them. He claimed that on 3 August the third side began to participate in the clashes between the Georgian and South Ossetian forces, firing on both the Georgians and South Ossetians. Illarionov said that the Ossetians do not deny the Georgian reports that on 7 August the Ossetians violated the ceasefire declared by Saakashvili. According to him, by August 2008 South Ossetia had become the most militarised territory per capita in the world, surpassing even North Korea. He also said that the Georgians apparently did not have any plan to invade South Ossetia, only a plan to defend the Georgian villages in South Ossetia.|$|E
