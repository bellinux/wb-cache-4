5|$|The {{partition}} was {{controversial and}} violently disputed. More <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million {{were killed in}} religious riots as 10–12million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.|$|E

5000|$|Lehiste {{demonstrated}} {{that when the}} peak frequencies in a vowel spectrum (the so-called [...] "formants") are closer together <b>than</b> about <b>half</b> <b>an</b> octave, listeners respond as if the two peaks were merged into a single peak. Many vowel distinctions straddle this half-octave threshold, e.g., the first two formants of [...] "bought" [...] are closer <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> octave, while those of [...] "but" [...] are not; {{the second and third}} formants of [...] "bit" [...] are closer <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> octave, while those of [...] "bet" [...] are not.|$|R
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century.|$|E

A number of his compositions were recorded by Marley, Peter Tosh, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and Neville Willoughby. Some of the tapes recorded by Norman during his sessions with Marley have been commercially released as part of the Marley compilation album, Soul Almighty.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} titanium {{is composed}} of 5 stable isotopes: 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti, and 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Eleven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 44Ti with a half-life of 63 years; 45Ti, 184.8 minutes; 51Ti, 5.76 minutes; and 52Ti, 1.7 minutes. All the other radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds and the majority, less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second.|$|E

5|$|The CenturyLink Field Event Center {{connects to}} the stadium's west field plaza and {{consists}} of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse.

According to the Public Stadium Authority's website, the event center contributes more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> billion dollars to the region's economy. The center was renamed the CenturyLink Field Event Center in June 2011, following the acquisition of Qwest Communications by CenturyLink and the renaming of the stadium.|$|E

In its current form, it is bounded by Brown Street to the west, Irving Avenue to the south, Trinity Avenue and Evanston Avenue to the east, and Caldwell Street and Stonemill Road to the north. This gives the area a roughly triangular shape.|$|E

5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war {{may also have}} increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, {{as well as the}} stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E

5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is {{a high-powered}} digital radio signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public.|$|E
5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|East Stirlingshire's {{traditional}} rival is Falkirk. The club's first match {{known as}} both Britannia and East Stirlingshire were friendly games against Falkirk in 1880 and 1881. Both clubs {{are based in}} Falkirk and have competed {{against each other in}} competitions such as Stirlingshire Cup since the late 19th century. East Stirlingshire was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1900, closely followed by Falkirk two seasons later in 1902–03. The first competitive league meeting between the clubs ended in a 2–0 win for Falkirk at Merchiston Park in August 1902. The two clubs' old grounds of Firs Park and Brockville Park were geographically close, separated by less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km).|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E
