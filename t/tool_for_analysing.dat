50|$|The {{development}} of enantioselective synthesis was initially slow, {{largely due to}} the limited range of techniques available for their separation and analysis.

The only <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysing</b> enantiomers was optical activity using a polarimeter, a method which provides no structural data.|$|E

50|$|A frame {{field is}} an {{orthonormal}} set of 4 vector fields (1 timelike, 3 spacelike) defined on a spacetime. Each frame field {{can be thought}} of as representing an observer in the spacetime moving along the integral curves of the timelike vector field. Every tensor quantity can be expressed in terms of a frame field, in particular, the metric tensor takes on a particularly convenient form. When allied with coframe fields, frame fields provide a powerful <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysing</b> spacetimes and physically interpreting the mathematical results.|$|E

The LinSig traffic modelling was based on standard 'Y' value hand calculations which were familiar to engineers and was widely used at the time for manually calculating traffic signal capacities and delays. This allowed the results of the software to be easily checked against existing manual calculations.|$|E

50|$|Chaîne opératoire (French for “operational chain” or “operational sequence”) is a {{term used}} {{throughout}} anthropological discourse, but is most commonly used in archaeology and sociocultural anthropology. It functions as a methodological <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysing</b> the technical processes and social acts involved in the step-by-step production, use, and eventual disposal of artifacts, such as lithics or pottery. This concept of technology as the science of human activities was first proposed by French archaeologist, André Leroi-Gourhan, and later by the historian of science, André-Georges Haudricourt. Both were students of Marcel Mauss who had earlier recognised that societies could be understood through its techniques {{by virtue of the}} fact that operational sequences are steps organised according to an internal logic specific to a society.|$|E
50|$|The UltraSPARC T1 {{microprocessor}} {{is unique}} in its strength and weaknesses, and as such is targeted at specific markets. Rather than being used for high-end number-crunching and ultra-high performance applications, the chip is targeted at network-facing high-demand servers, such as high-traffic web servers, and mid-tier Java, ERP, and CRM application servers, which often utilize {{a large number of}} separate threads. One of the limitations of the T1 design is that a single floating point unit (FPU) is shared between all 8 cores, making the T1 unsuitable for applications performing a lot of floating point mathematics. However, since the processor's intended markets do not typically make much use of floating-point operations, Sun does not expect this to be a problem. Sun provides a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysing</b> an application's level of parallelism and use of floating point instructions to determine if it is suitable for use on a T1 or T2 platform.|$|E

50|$|The fusion {{methods such as}} averaging, Brovey method, {{principal}} component analysis (PCA) and IHS based methods fall under spatial domain approaches. Another important spatial domain fusion method is the high pass filtering based technique. Here the high frequency details are injected into upsampled version of MS images. The disadvantage of spatial domain approaches is that they produce spatial distortion in the fused image. Spectral distortion becomes a negative factor while we go for further processing, such as classification problem. Spatial distortion can be very well handled by frequency domain approaches on image fusion. The multiresolution analysis has become a very useful <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysing</b> remote sensing images. The discrete wavelet transform has become a very useful tool for fusion. Some other fusion methods are also there, such as Laplacian pyramid based, curvelet transform based etc. These methods show a better performance in spatial and spectral quality of the fused image compared to other spatial methods of fusion.|$|E
