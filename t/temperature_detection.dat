After the analysis of domestic and foreign warehouse intelligent temperature and humidity control, the author has found a series of factors of that, and then puts forward a design of scheme of <b>temperature</b> and humidity <b>detection</b> system based on AT 89 S 51, together with a plurality of digital temperature sensor DS 18 B 20 and the humidity sensor HS 1101, <b>temperature</b> and humidity <b>detection</b> system is formed...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of photocurrent {{in an ideal}} two-dimensional Dirac spectrum is symmetry forbidden. In sharp contrast, we show that three-dimensional Weyl semimetals can generically support significant photocurrents due to the combination of inversion symmetry breaking and finite tilts of the Weyl spectra. Symmetry properties, chirality relations, and various dependencies of this photovoltaic effect on the system and the light source are explored in detail. Our results suggest that noncentrosymmetric Weyl materials can be advantageously applied to room <b>temperature</b> <b>detections</b> of mid- and far-infrared radiations. United States.

50|$|Usually washing {{machines}} thermostats have fewer fixed <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> points {{than the number}} of wash temperatures used. For intermediate temperatures, the cam mechanism uses the stop and wait method to heat to the nearest temp below the one desired, then uses only fixed timing of the heating element to increase the water to the desired temperature.|$|E

50|$|The second {{method of}} <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> {{is based on}} {{intensity}} ratios of two separate emission lines; the change in coating temperature is reflected by the change of the phosphorescence spectrum. This method enables surface temperature distributions to be measured. The intensity ratio method has the advantage that polluted optics has {{little effect on the}} measurement as it compares ratios between emission lines. The emission lines are equally affected by 'dirty' surfaces or optics.|$|E
5000|$|The processor's {{heatsink}} is permanently attached, and the removable fan module {{is powered}} via spring-like metal prongs that connect to {{a trio of}} conductors {{on the surface of}} the chip. The clip that releases the fan is visible in the first photo, at the top left corner of the CPU. The central plastic [...] "column" [...] that leads from the center of the fan houses the fan wiring and leads down the side of the heatsink at this corner. The small plastic points at each top left of this column are the locking mechanism for the fan and are released by squeezing them. The opposite corner of the CPU has a latch that locks the fan around underneath the heatsink, by swinging into place upon assembly. The processor monitors the fan and will throttle back on clock speed to prevent overheating and damage if the fan is not operating. This is a predecessor to the internal <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> and protection in Intel's modern processors.|$|E
5000|$|Early works {{considered}} {{the integration of}} luminescent materials as erosion sensors in TBCs. The notion of a [...] "thermal barrier sensor coating" [...] (sensor TBC) for <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> was introduced in 1998. Instead of applying a phosphor layer on the surface where the temperature needs to be measured, it was proposed to locally modify {{the composition of the}} TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor as well as a protective thermal barrier. This dual functional material enables surface temperature measurement but also could provide a means to measure temperature within the TBC and at the metal/topcoat interface, hence enabling the manufacturing of an integrated heat flux gauge. First results on yttria-stabilized zirconia co-doped with europia (YSZ:Eu) powders were published in 2000. They also demonstrated sub-surface measurements looking through a 50 μm undoped YSZ layer and detecting the phosphorescence of a thin (10 µm) YSZ:Eu layer (bi-layer system) underneath using the ESAVD technique to produce the coating. The first results on electron beam physical vapour deposition of TBCs were published in 2001. The coating tested was a monolayer coating of standard YSZ co-doped with dysprosia (YSZ:Dy). First work on industrial atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sensor coating systems commenced around 2002 and was published in 2005. They demonstrated the capabilities of APS sensor coatings for in-situ two-dimensional temperature measurements in burner rigs using a high speed camera system. Further, temperature measurement capabilities of APS sensor coatings were demonstrated beyond 1400 °C. Results on multilayer sensing TBCs, enabling simultaneous temperature measurements below and {{on the surface of the}} coating, were reported. Such a multilayer coating could also be used as a heat flux gauge in order to monitor the thermal gradient and also to determine the heat flux through the thickness of the TBC under realistic service conditions.|$|E

40|$|Cryogenic <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> {{underlies}} {{the understanding of}} important physical phenomena and is crucial for material science and space exploration. Simple, facile, and accurate assessment of temperature, especially for surface or body thermal mapping, {{is one of the}} challenges that must be addressed when developing new materials or technologies for thermometers. Here, we introduce a <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> strategy based on a 3 D cross-correlative matrix derived from fluorescence response patterns of an organic probe in three solvation envelopes. The intermolecular interactions, such as excimer or exciplex formation, intramolecular charge transfer and solvent relaxation processes, between the probe and molecule surroundings, are attributed to the unique temperature-dependent optical behaviors in different solutions. The precise <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> originated from apparent variations in fluorescence intensity and wavelength upon temperature change in these solvents. This enabled the construction of a comprehensive temperature sensor array, which gives a unique visible color pattern of signals as a read-output discernible by the naked eye. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, a new strategy for facile and non-destructive thermal mapping of a crystal surface is presented...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the work on thermographic {{phosphors}} was mainly carried out in the US. It is only in recent years that other research groups have explored the field. However, in the future turbine inlet temperatures are likely to increase in order to achieve higher efficiencies introducing greater stress on the components and in particular the turbine blade coatings. Thus there is a general need for advanced <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> methods such as thermographic phosphors. When illuminated with UV light they exhibit luminescence, which is temperature dependent by virtue of variations in the relative intensities of distinct emission lines or in the time constant of the exponential decay, which occurs once excitation has ceased. Thermographic phosphors could be employed for <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> in the hot section of a gas turbine and this technique promises <b>temperature</b> <b>detection</b> of up to 1400 oC with uncertainties better than for other remote standard techniques such as pyrometry. The paper will address the instrumentation development over recent months and sources of uncertainty when the technique is applied in the field. The paper briefly reviews the application of thermographic phosphors for surface temperature measurements in laboratory combustor of realistic geometry and also includes calculations for the cooling effectiveness...|$|E

The online <b>temperature</b> <b>detections</b> {{of fiber}} along the {{spinning}} line {{should be the}} important means for the precise controlling of fiber higher order structures as well as fiber-final performance. In this paper, a method of measurement fiber temperature has been introduced which mainly use the instrument of monochromatic infrared thermometer to measure fiber temperature in the melt-spinning processes. Due to the probe field of view of monochromatic infrared thermometer being {{much larger than the}} fiber diameter, monochrome infrared thermometers can't be used to measure temperature of fibers directly, the measurement results is an average between the fiber and backgrounds, which can't be used to indicate the temperature of fibers directly and have to calibrated.
