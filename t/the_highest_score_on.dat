25|$|Making his One-Day International debut for Australia against South Africa, Jaques made 94, falling six runs {{short of}} his maiden century. His innings broke a 23-year-old record of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> debut for Australia in a One-Day International. In November 2006, Jaques scored {{successive}} centuries {{in three days}} against England, in the warm up to the 2006–07 Ashes series in Australia. His first, playing for a Prime Minister's XI, was an impressive 112. His second was 107, playing for New South Wales. However the selectors stuck with regular openers Hayden and Langer and Jaques was forced to bide his time with NSW. One year later, and following the retirement from international cricket of Justin Langer, Jaques was called up to the Test squad for the home series against Sri Lanka ahead of his rival for the place, Western Australia's Chris Rogers, {{in part due to}} a fluent second innings 167 in a Pura Cup match against Western Australia in which Rogers scored 9 and 17.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} patterns of academic burnout in 730 Chinese middle school students, and to link the burnout patterns with academic motivation. Using cluster analysis, we identified four motivation groups: (a) distressed group, (b) persevering group, (c) laissez-faire group, and (d) well-functioning group. The results of optimal scaling procedures indicated that grade level and motivation variables (intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and amotivation) were good discriminators among the four clusters. Specifically, variation on self-determination motivation characteristics was demonstrated among different academic burnout profiles: distressed students had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> a motivation and external motivation. In contrast, well-functioning students had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> intrinsic motivation. For persevering and laissez-faire students, there was no significant difference on intrinsic motivation. However, persevering students reported <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> a motivation and external motivation than laissez-faire students...|$|R
