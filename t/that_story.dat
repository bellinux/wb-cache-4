5|$|Written by Malcolm Hulke, this six-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 5 July 1968. The serial was cancelled on 30 December 1968 and its production budget allocated to The War Games, allowing <b>that</b> <b>story</b> to {{be expanded to}} 10 episodes.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates the {{perception}} of technical descriptions and of stories where the events are driven by the motivations and emotions of their characters. The study is explorative, using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and {{with a total of}} 10 participants. The participants accepted the use of stories and strongly preferred stories with emotional and dramatic elements. The study indicates <b>that</b> human-centered <b>stories</b> encourage and facilitate detailed discussions of social aspects and situations of use, whereas technical descriptions may block such discussions. The study indicate <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> are not a reliable mean of changing the attitudes of the readers, and it shows <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> are not better than technical descriptions for communicating factual or technical information...|$|R
5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found <b>that</b> <b>story</b> in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so they fled in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept <b>that</b> <b>story</b> for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} role that {{storytelling}} might play in the professional learning of English teachers. It begins by reflecting on the ways <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> shape our everyday lives, and then considers how the meaning-making potential of storytelling might enable us to gain insights into our work as educators. This is in contradistinction to the ‘knowledge’ currently privileged by standards-based reforms, most notably the fetish of measurement reflected in standardized testing. The essay concludes <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> are not simply a form of knowing but a vital means of making the world human to us...|$|R

5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between <b>that</b> <b>story</b> and La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to the}} Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E
5|$|Producer Michael G. Wilson {{developed}} the film's plot while the previous {{film in the}} series, Casino Royale, was being shot. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Craig and Forster had to write some sections themselves due to the Writers' Strike, though they were not given the screenwriter credit in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only, though the film does not contain any elements of <b>that</b> <b>story.</b> Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence, and Dennis Gassner's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam's work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains, Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic city, with distinct quarters occupied by Otomi, Zapotec, Mixtec, Maya, and Nahua peoples. The Totonacs have always maintained {{that they were the}} ones who built it. The Aztecs repeated <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> but it has not been corroborated by archaeological findings.|$|E

25|$|Charteris gave Templar {{interests}} and quirks as the series went on.

25|$|The central {{subject of}} several {{versions}} of the Kentish Royal Legend is {{an account of the}} murder of two young princes, restitution by way of land to found an abbey by Domne Eafe, and the life of its second Abbess, Mildrith.

5000|$|This {{is not to}} say <b>that</b> <b>Story's</b> Commentaries {{met with}} {{universal}} approval.

According to Kent Newmyer, [...] "that Story was the focal point of Southern animus only testified to his prominence as the authority on the Constitution." [...] H. Jefferson Powell, in [...] "Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution: A Belated Review" [...] first published in the Yale Law Journal, quotes Upshur's opinion that the Commentaries were [...] "mere dogmas", and John Calhoun's opinion <b>that</b> <b>Story's</b> Commentaries were essentially false and dangerous.|$|R

25|$|The popular Welsh song 'Myfanwy' was {{composed}} by Joseph Parry and {{first published in}} 1875. Parry wrote the music to lyrics written by Richard Davies ('Mynyddog'; 1833–77). The lyrics were probably inspired by the fourteenth-century love-story of Myfanwy Fychan of Castell Dinas Brân, and the poet Hywel ab Einion. <b>That</b> <b>story</b> was also {{the subject of the}} popular poem, 'Myfanwy Fychan' (1858), by John Ceiriog Hughes (1832–87).|$|E
25|$|According to Shakespeare's first biographer Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare fled Stratford {{after he}} got in trouble for {{poaching}} deer from local squire Thomas Lucy, and that he then wrote a scurrilous ballad about Lucy. It is also reported, according to a note added by Samuel Johnson to the 1765 edition of Rowe's Life, that Shakespeare minded the horses for theatre patrons in London.

And here the Jayhawkers stopped them cold, stealing some herds and generally forcing the rest to stay in the Indian Territory.

25|$|In episode seven, Fiona Carter leaves {{because the}} actress portraying her, Olga Sosnovska, was {{pregnant}} during filming and chose {{to leave the}} programme. In <b>that</b> <b>story</b> arc, Fiona attempts to kill her deranged ex-husband, whom she thought was hanged several years earlier. However, her ex-husband ultimately abducts her and later shoots her dead in Adam's presence during her attempted escape. Her character is replaced by Jo Portman (played by Miranda Raison), a new arrival at MI5 who was recruited by Adam in a previous episode.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims {{to have been a}} member of the Russian {{aristocracy}} before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that young adults tend to identify and reinforce negative stereotypes of growing older. They can express both fear and trepidation regarding the bodily changes that occur with advancing age. With this in mind, in this paper we draw upon Frank's (2010) theoretical framework of socio-narratology to examine the work <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> can do. We take as a working example the impact <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> of ageing told by masters athletes might have upon young adults, and specifically their perceptions of (self-) ageing. Three focus groups were carried out with the young adults to examine their perceptions of (self-) ageing prior to and following their viewing of a digital story portraying images and narratives of mature, natural (‘drug-free’) bodybuilders. Our analysis pointed to a number specific capacities <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> of masters athletes might have, namely the potential to re-open young adults sense of narrative foreclosure, the stretching and expanding of existing imagined storylines, and increasing the availability of narrative options. We propose <b>that</b> understanding what <b>stories</b> can do, what they can do best, and the narrative environments that help and hinder this process is essential if our programmes and policies are to produce the results that are wanted...|$|R
