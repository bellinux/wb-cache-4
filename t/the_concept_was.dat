5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series. Ubisoft France's managing director Xavier Poix and his team felt the Wii Remote and Nunchuck would work well for music games; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 featured a music minigame that IGN compared to Guitar Hero—where players shook the Wii Remote or Nunchuck when prompted to play an instrument. For , <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> iterated into a pose-based dance game. Proving popular in demonstrations, <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> refined and re-developed into a stand-alone game.|$|E
5|$|Christmas clubs were savings {{programs}} first {{offered by}} banks in 1909. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> simple: bank customers deposited a set {{amount of money}} each week into a special savings account, and received the money {{at a later date}} for Christmas shopping.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{failures}} of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940, there was a period of inactivity in which <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{ventilation}} concepts {{for commercial}} buildings are presented in this paper. <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> specially designed for northern climate conditions. Probably <b>the</b> most potential <b>concept</b> will <b>be</b> {{a combination of all}} these concepts, because hybrid systems are always more or less dependent on structure of buildings. The bases of <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> efficient and demand based use of low pressure fans. <b>The</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> equipped with IR- and CO 2 -sensors to guarantee the efficient usage of energy. <b>The</b> <b>concepts</b> have <b>been</b> carried out with individual control of indoor air temperature, so they fit well both to open-plan and cellular office types, and make the flexibility possible.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>concept</b> of invulnerability <b>is</b> {{explored}} {{from the}} perspective of nursing, medicine, psychology, sociology, public health, and education. Walker and Avant’s framework for <b>concept</b> analysis will <b>be</b> used. Definitions of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>are</b> presented along with related terms. Antecedents, attributes, and consequences of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>are</b> discussed in detail. Model, borderline, related, and contrary cases are presented to provide a rich representation of <b>the</b> <b>concept.</b> Empirical referents and implications for nursing are presented...|$|R
5|$|In April 1962, McNamara {{asked the}} Nike team to {{consider}} using the Zeus site on Kwajalein as an operational anti-satellite base after the main Zeus testing had completed. The Nike team responded that a {{system could be}} readied for testing by May 1963. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> given the name Project Mudflap.|$|E
5|$|Scott & Bailey was {{commissioned}} after <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> introduced to executive producer Nicola Shindler, who {{brought it to}} writer Sally Wainwright. The series is produced by Manchester-based Red Production Company and is largely filmed in the Greater Manchester area.|$|E
5|$|Subsonic-cruise unarmed decoy: SCUD {{resembled the}} B-52 on radar. As an active decoy, it carried ECM and other devices, {{and it had}} a range of several hundred miles. Although SCUD was never {{deployed}} operationally, <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> developed, becoming known as the air launched cruise missile (ALCM-A).|$|E
50|$|An {{introductory}} {{description of}} <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> given with. In contrast to some faulty explanations, <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> may <b>be</b> applied {{as well with}} IEEE 802.15.4aCSS as with IEEE 802.15.4aUWB modulation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} a new method for distribution system fault management with sensor applications. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> based on distributed wireless sensors that {{are attached to}} the incoming and out going power lines of the different feeders. The main novelty of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> in detecting and locating faults by combining the power distribution network characteristics on system level. The feasibility of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> shown with several simulations done in PSCAD environment.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} an {{imaginary}} friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project Night Skies. It was filmed from September to December 1981 in California on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most films, it was shot in rough chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} and {{tested by the}} five fighter catapult ships, commissioned as warships and commanded and crewed by the Royal Navy - but the CAM ships were merchant vessels, commanded and crewed by the Merchant Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of articles of agreement, agreed before matches by the stakeholders, largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> {{more important in}} terms of defining the rules of play and eventually these were codified as the Laws of Cricket.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> abandoned for good.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} July 2006 after work was {{completed}} on Titan Quest, with preparatory work beginning prior to this. Staff members returned while assuming different roles {{to the original}} game: Michael Verrette produced, Michael Sheidow acted as art director, the script was written by Dean O'Donnell, while Arthur Bruno took over as main designer. Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay experience. It also went for a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released to a positive critical reception and favorable sales.|$|E

5000|$|A Carathéodory- {{solution}} is a generalized solution to an ordinary differential equation. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> due to I. Michael Ross and {{named in honor}} of Constantin Carathéodory. [...] Its practicality was demonstrated in 2008 by Ross et al. [...] in a laboratory implementation of <b>the</b> <b>concept.</b> <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> most useful for implementing feedback controls, particularly those generated by an application of Ross' pseudospectral optimal control theory.|$|R
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} {{months to go}} into full production. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished to convey the idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first {{came up with the}} robots, whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be referred to a committee member. Umpires were introduced {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field referee was introduced for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. The umpires would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and the umpires became linesmen. The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E

5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{for being}} an early example of a 3D {{platform}} game, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos began development as a concept for a 3D platformer in which the player controlled the character Yoshi from Nintendo's Super Mario series. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> pitched to Nintendo by Argonaut, but was ultimately rejected by the company, ending Argonaut's relationship with Nintendo and prompting them to design a new character and retool the game as an original property.|$|E
