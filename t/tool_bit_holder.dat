50|$|Originally, all <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> {{were made}} of high carbon tool steels with the {{appropriate}} hardening and tempering.

5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a toolpost that brings its follower rest along with it. A <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> (or several <b>tool</b> <b>bits)</b> and a compact follower rest (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the follower rest opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a follower rest. One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The rollers turn with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> {{have been}} used for centuries, yet their further {{technological}} development continues even today. Before about 1900, almost all <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made by their users, and many machine shops had forges. In fact, good machinists were expected to have blacksmithing knowledge, and although the chemistry and physics of the heat treatment of steel were not well understood (as compared with today's sciences), the practical art of heat treatment was quite advanced, and something that most skilled metalworkers were comfortably acquainted with. <b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made of carbon tool steels, which have high enough carbon content to take hardening well. Each bit was forged with a hammer, quenched, and then ground with a grindstone. The exact details of the heat treatment and tip geometry were a matter of individual experience and preference.|$|R

50|$|A {{fly cutter}} is {{composed}} of a body into which one or two <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> take broad, shallow facing cuts.

Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic {{impacting}} penetrators (USIPs) are recent {{additions to}} the series of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corers (USDCs). A USIP enables a rod probe to penetrate packed soil or another substance of similar consistency, without need to apply a large axial force {{that could result in}} buckling of the probe or in damage to some buried objects. USIPs were conceived for use in probing and analyzing soil to depths of tens of centimeters in the vicinity of buried barrels containing toxic waste, without causing rupture of the barrels. USIPs could also be used for other purposes, including, for example, searching for pipes, barrels, or other hard objects buried in soil; and detecting land mines. USDCs and other apparatuses based on USDCs have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. The ones reported previously were designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. To recapitulate: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> As shown in the figure, a basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, a backing and a horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can slide axially a short distance between the horn and the shoulder of <b>tool</b> <b>bit),</b> and a <b>tool</b> <b>bit,</b> i. e., probe for USIP. The piezoelectric stack is driven at the resonance frequency of the stack/horn/backing assembly to create ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. To prevent fracture during operation, the piezoelectric stack is held in compression by a bolt. The bouncing of the free mass between the horn and the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> at sonic frequencies generates hammering actions to the bit that are more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations in ordinary ultrasonic drills. The hammering actions are so effective that the axial force needed to make the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> advance into the material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary twist drilling, ultrasonic drilling, or ordinary steady pushing...|$|R

40|$|A shape {{reminiscent}} of a dog bone {{has been found to}} be superior to other shapes for mechanical-amplification horns that are components of piezoelectrically driven actuators used in a series of related devices denoted generally as ultrasonic/sonic drill/corers (USDCs). The first of these devices was reported in Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corers With Integrated Sensors (NPO- 20856), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25, No. 1 (January 2001), page 38. The dog-bone shape was conceived especially for use in a more recent device in the series, denoted an ultrasonic/ sonic gopher, that was described in Ultrasonic/Sonic Mechanisms for Drilling and Coring (NPO- 30291), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. The figure shows an example of a dog-bone-shaped horn and other components of an ultrasonic gopher. Prerequisite to a meaningful description of this development is an unavoidably lengthy recapitulation of the principle of operation of a USDC and, more specifically, of the ultrasonic/sonic gopher as described previously in NASA Tech Briefs. The ultrasonic actuator includes a stack of piezoelectric rings, the horn, a metal backing, and a bolt that connects the aforementioned parts and provides compressive pre-strain to the piezoelectric stack to prevent breakage of the rings during extension. The stack of piezoelectric rings is excited at the resonance frequency of the overall ultrasonic actuator. Through mechanical amplification by the horn, the displacement in the ultrasonic vibration reaches tens of microns at the tip of the horn. The horn hammers an object that is denoted the free mass because it is free to move longitudinally over a limited distance between hard stops: The free mass bounces back and forth between the ultrasonic horn and a <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> (a drill bit or a corer). Because the longitudinal speed of the free mass is smaller than the longitudinal speed of vibration of the tip of the horn, contact between the free mass and the horn tip usually occurs at a phase of the vibration favorable to transfer of momentum from the horn to the free mass. Therefore, the free mass picks up momentum and is accelerated back to the <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> Upon impact of the free mass on the <b>tool</b> <b>bit,</b> momentum is transferred to the <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> The impacts of the free mass on the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> repeat at a sonic frequency that can range from tens of hertz to about 1 kHz. The shock waves caused by the impacts of the free mass propagate to the interface between the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> and the medium (typically, rock, ice, or other brittle material) to be drilled or cored. The medium becomes fractured when its ultimate strain is exceeded at the medium/tool-bit interface. This concludes the description of the principle of operation...|$|R
