5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
25|$|Youth {{exclusion}} is multi-dimensional in that age, race, gender, {{class and}} lifestyle all affect youth life experiences {{within a given}} culture. This intersectionality affects {{the degree to which}} an individual youth experiences exclusion. Similarly, youth exclusion is context specific. This means <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> are excluded from society in different ways depending on their cultural and spatial locations. A simple difference between the opportunities and resources provided in one neighborhood can create a divide among youth who are included and youth who are excluded from their communities. Another consideration is <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> exclusion is relational insofar as social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and the excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations who believe that the economic support services and institutions that help the youth puts their own comfortable standard of living at risk. All of these demographic, cultural, spatial and relational factors contribute to the worldwide experiences of youth exclusion.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} {{researchers}} at experiment {{stations of the}} land-grant universities and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{concerns}} {{were raised in}} Parliament <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> were being taught to use firearms, namely M16 rifles, in National Service. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Najib Razak, stated that this was merely a pilot project. However, a Democratic Action Party Member of Parliament (MP) claimed that the Parliamentary Select Committee on Unity and National Service had not been informed of the project. The firearms module is now a module of the program.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} stated that sambo was a demonstration sport at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR. It is true <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> sambo was {{demonstrated in the}} Games' opening ceremonies; however, sambo was never formally recognised as a demonstration sport. This common error in history books is noted in several sources including From SAMOZ to SAMBO by Anatoly Makovetskii and Lukashev's History of Hand-to-Hand Combat in the First Half of the 20th Century: Founders and Authors. Furthermore, the official documents of the 1980 Olympic Organizing Committee do not mention sambo as a participating sport in the Games.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} youth {{attitudes toward}} difference and cultural diversity. Firstly, we analyse data from 65 countries showing <b>that</b> <b>youths</b> are more tolerant than older people toward both stigmatised groups and groups perceived as racially or ethnically different. Findings {{also show that}} political conservatism is a very stable predictor of intolerance to difference. Secondly, we study the appraisals of cultural diversity in 21 European countries, showing <b>that</b> <b>youths</b> express greater openness to cultural diversity than older people. In this new study, while values of conservation correlate negatively with openness to cultural diversity, values of self-transcendence correlate positively...|$|R

25|$|Youth {{empowerment}} is {{a process}} where {{children and young people}} are encouraged to take charge of their lives. They do this by addressing their situation and then take action in order to improve their access to resources and transform their consciousness through their beliefs, values, and attitudes. Youth empowerment aims to improve quality of life. Youth empowerment is achieved through participation in youth empowerment programs. However scholars argue that children’s rights implementation should go beyond learning about formal rights and procedures to give birth to a concrete experience of rights. There are numerous models <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> empowerment programs use that help youth achieve empowerment. A variety of youth empowerment initiatives are underway around the world. These programs can be through non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.|$|E
25|$|Chief Flying Hawk {{appreciated}} <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> {{education was}} essential to preserve Lakota culture. During his travels, he frequently visited public schools for presentations, and {{wanted to talk about}} making over the white man’s history so that the young people would know the truth. Flying Hawk wanted school history programs to tell the stories of Native American warriors and statesmen who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture. He selected Native American warriors and statesmen from different tribes: Red Jacket, Seneca; Little Turtle, Miami; Logan, Oneida; Cornplanter, Seneca; Osceola, Seminole; Red Bird, Winnebago; Pontiac, Ottawa; Tecumseh, Shawnee; Black Hawk, Sauk; Red Cloud, Lakota; and Sitting Bull, Lakota. Flying Hawk was impressed with the oratory of Red Jacket, Logan, Black Hawk, Tecumseh, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud, and requested that their speeches be included in his commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian {{census data}} (PNAD, 1999) {{indicate}} that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They {{were joined by}} 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds. Due to the raised age restriction of 14, {{at least half of}} the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws. Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour, there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{conducted in the}} United States has shown that truancy {{increases the risk of}} marijuana use among adolescents. The current study examines this relationship in Chile. By using a longitudinal study conducted from 2008 to 2011 among school students in 7 th grade in Santiago, Chile, I test the effect that truancy has on the onset of marijuana use, controlling for a number of potential confounders. The findings support the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>youths</b> who reported having been truant were more likely to initiate marijuana use. However, I did not find enough support for the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>youths</b> who reported have skipped schools more days were at a higher risk of initiating marijuana use...|$|R
500|$|Scott Beattie {{wrote in}} his 2009 book, Community, Space and Online Censorship, that the {{question}} [...] "Will no one think of the children?" [...] was often raised by individuals advocating censorship out of a concern <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> might view material deemed inappropriate. According to Beattie, youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online sexual predators to increase regulation of the Internet; characterizing children as infantile evoked a concept of innocence which {{was a form of}} obsession over the concept of purity.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the plan, Chab Dai Canada initiated the Canadian Freedom Registry Project [...] "to promote and enable the implementation of...Canada’s National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking...focusing specifically on partnership." [...] Chab Dai sought to research ways to improve anti-human-trafficking activities in Canada and to facilitate information sharing between anti-human-trafficking organisations and the federal and provincial governments. In April 2013, a troika of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights composed of Brazil, the Philippines, and the Republic of Ireland released a report reviewing Canada {{as part of that}} year's Universal Periodic Review; the report highlighted the establishment of the NAP-CHT as a positive achievement. UNICEF Canada approved of the establishment of the NAP-CHT, and encouraged Canadians to write letters to politicians asking them to make sure <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> and children are the plan's foremost priorities. The politicians UNICEF recommended that people write to Harper, Toews, Kenney, and Rob Nicholson, the Minister of Justice.|$|E
500|$|All of Bundy's known {{victims were}} white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all {{were between the}} ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He {{apparently}} never approached anyone he might have met before. (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her [...] "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.") Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her. Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: [...] "hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. [...] "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different." [...] He did concede <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> and beauty were [...] "absolutely indispensable criteria" [...] in his choice of victims.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Youth</b> Code would open for alternative rock band AFI starting in January. The announcement came {{just a few months}} after a stint supporting Belgian electro-industrial act Suicide Commando. George had described how they were so bewildered by the invitation that they could not refuse. The duo were not very well received on stage, but stated that the band generated more interest backstage, where they would hold conversations with mostly older members of the audience. George also noted that they [...] "felt like missionaries" [...] while performing with AFI, introducing industrial music to a younger generation. Youth Code also performed several dates in support of shoegazing groups Nothing and Whirr.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk {{took the}} {{responsibilities}} of being a chief seriously and always thought about {{the best way to}} do things for his people. [...] He appreciated <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> education was essential to preserve Lakota culture and frequently visited public schools for presentations. Flying Hawk wanted to talk about making over the white man’s history so that the young people would know the truth. The white man’s books about Indians did not tell the truth. Major Israel McCreight lived with the Oglala Lakota during the period of their greatest suffering and wanted to tell the story of Native Americans who fought bravely to defend the invasion of their homelands and the lives of their families.|$|E
2500|$|Other ways to {{decrease}} youth exclusion include increased intergoup {{contact between the}} differing social positions of the excluders and the excluded. Benefits of inclusion have indeed been measured by sociologists. One such experiment researched elementary aged children to record their personal views on prejudice and social exclusion. The researchers found, [...] "In the present investigation, in accord with prior research (e.g., Crystal et al. 2008; Killen et al. 2007b), ethnic minority students reporting high levels of intergroup contact {{were more likely to}} rate race-based exclusion as wrong than were students with low levels of intergroup contact". Integration of peer groups helps lessen xenophobic reactions to others and fosters inclusion among all members of a society. This realization is helpful to educators who want to create inclusive environments so <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> will feel secure in their learning environments.|$|E
2500|$|Avicenna generalizes youth {{as having}} a [...] "hot" [...] temperament, but {{comments}} that there is controversy over which periods of youth are hotter. The general notion <b>that</b> <b>youth</b> are [...] "hot" [...] in temperament is due to youth's supposed relationship {{to members of the}} body that are hot. For example, blood was considered [...] "hot" [...] as was mentioned earlier, therefore youth is assumed to be hot partially due to blood being more [...] "plentiful" [...] and [...] "thicker", according to Avicenna. Evidence for youth having an excess of blood is suggested by Avicenna's observation that nose bleeds are more frequent within youth. Other contributing factors are the youth's association with sperm and the consistency of their bile. Further description of youth in regards to heat and moisture is given with respect to sex, geographical location, and occupation. The Canon says, for example, that females are colder and more moist.|$|E
