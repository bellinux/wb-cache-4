5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the carriage.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Albion players – {{along with}} those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the {{abandoned}} season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999–2000. Red numbers were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Albion players' shorts in 1969.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, sharp bounds for cyclic sums of {{the ratio}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exradius <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a {{triangle}} are established {{depending on the}} circumradius and inradius of the triangle. The best possible parameters for the expressions of bounds are derived. Moreover, an alternative bound for the ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exradius <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> triangle, expressed by trigonometric functions, is also considered.|$|R
2500|$|Let one n-gon be {{inscribed in}} a circle, and let another n-gon be {{tangential}} to that circle at the vertices {{of the first}} n-gon. Then from any point P on the circle, {{the product of the}} perpendicular distances from P [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first n-gon equals the product of the perpendicular distances from P <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second n-gon.|$|R

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that}} the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|In 1215 William {{joined the}} baronial {{rebellion}} against John, {{and lost his}} naval offices, the royal forester's office for Somerset, and custody of Lydford Castle. In May 1216 the king offered William a safe conduct, which noted that William had fled overseas. The letters were witnessed by Peter des Roches. In mid-1217, he rejoined the royalist cause, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Henry III. This action regained him some of his lost lands.|$|E
50|$|Altitudes {{can be used}} in the {{computation}} of {{the area}} of a triangle: one half of the product of an altitude's length and its base's length equals the triangle's area. Thus, the longest altitude is perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shortest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle. The altitudes are also related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle through the trigonometric functions.|$|R
50|$|A Lane marker {{attachment}} {{could be}} fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AVRE <b>to</b> delineate lanes through minefields or cleared terrain. Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sherman Crab, it deployed both tape and lights.|$|R

5|$|In 1976 a {{memorial}} to the demolished school was placed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Clal Center, facing Jaffa Road. The memorial consists of a decorative iron gate etched {{with the name of}} the school in French. The gate is mounted between two stone pillars; it is not standing in its original location.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Richard and Edward {{were forced}} to flee to Burgundy in October 1470 after Warwick {{defected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou, {{and for a second}} time Richard was forced to seek refuge in the Low Countries, which were part of the realm of the Duchy of Burgundy. In 1468, Richard's sister Margaret had married Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Although only eighteen years old, Richard played crucial roles in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury that resulted in Edward's restoration to the throne in spring 1471.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the original structure and widening the roadways over the old footpaths. It is a bottleneck and becomes congested at peak travel times, and {{in the event of}} a breakdown or accident on the bridge, traffic in the area comes to a standstill. To resolve this problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located on the London Inner Ring Road at the eastern end of Euston Road, next to the {{junction}} with Pentonville Road, Gray's Inn Road and York Way. To the west, at the other side of Pancras Road, is St. Pancras railway station. Several London bus routes, including 10, 30, 59, 73, 91, 205, 390, 476 pass in front of or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the station.|$|E
50|$|A tail fairing, {{sometimes}} referred to as a tail unit or race tail, is mounted behind the seat and rider. Some also extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of,</b> and below, <b>the</b> saddle and usually providing a small storage space.|$|R

50|$|His figurative work {{is minimal}} in style, {{and so is}} modern in appearance. Distinctive stylistic traits include very rounded forms and hands that are {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figure, so that the arms are circular in shape.|$|R
5|$|The work {{is rich in}} {{symbolism}} and iconographic elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, {{and on the other}} side a columbine, recalling the Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
