5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that <b>those</b> <b>to</b> the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while <b>those</b> <b>to</b> the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than <b>those</b> <b>to</b> chlorine but higher than <b>those</b> <b>to</b> iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the date}} of first {{settlement}} in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with <b>those</b> <b>to</b> the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made {{some of the first}} maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.|$|E

50|$|According to Natyashastra, state Sally Banes and Andre Lepeck, {{drama is}} that art which accepts {{human beings are}} in {{different}} inner states when they arrive as audience, then through the art performed, it provides enjoyment <b>to</b> <b>those</b> wanting pleasure, solace <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in grief, calmness <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are worried, energy <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are brave, courage <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are cowards, eroticism <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who want company, enjoyment <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are rich, knowledge <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are uneducated, wisdom <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who are educated. Drama represents the truths about life and worlds, through emotions and circumstances, to deliver entertainment, but more importantly ethos, questions, peace and happiness.|$|R
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of <b>those</b> <b>to</b> whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E

Not all gigs have content to unlock, rather just <b>those</b> <b>to</b> which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar).|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as <b>those</b> <b>to</b> make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E

Injuries (especially <b>those</b> <b>to</b> the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of tori misjudging the ability of uke to receive the throw or pin.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of <b>those</b> <b>to</b> be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E

5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.

5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than <b>those</b> <b>to</b> which the body is normally exposed.

However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The Shaktisamgama Tantra says that only brave souls (viras) should follow Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The Shakta Pramoda warns that {{improper}} worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta beheading the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals {{to be followed by}} householders and <b>those</b> <b>to</b> be followed by renouncers. The Todala Tantra mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta's worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha ("headless trunk") as the goddess's consort.|$|E
5|$|The fan car and {{hydropneumatic}} suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among <b>those</b> <b>to</b> claim that the cars were fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than <b>those</b> <b>to</b> the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E
