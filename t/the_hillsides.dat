5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.|$|E

5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
