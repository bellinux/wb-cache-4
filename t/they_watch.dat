5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. <b>They</b> <b>watch</b> where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|For {{their next}} mission, {{the party is}} sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the {{construction}} of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can blow up the Dreadnought, <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought.

Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010â€“11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> him play.|$|E

After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E
40|$|Methods {{of study}} include two {{questionnaires}} and eight photographs of television characters used while interviewing sixty children, ages four and five. The {{data showed that}} the children actively selected the television programs <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> rather than <b>watching</b> at random. <b>They</b> <b>watched</b> television regularly and named the programs <b>they</b> <b>watched.</b> The children perceived {{a great amount of}} parental supervision in their viewing of television. Most children were able to understand the concepts of fantasy and reality, to distinguish between those concepts, and to apply them to specific television program characters and their actions. However, the five-year-olds showed a greater tendency to identify television program characters as make-believe...|$|R

5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As <b>they</b> <b>watch,</b> the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The Science Behind Pixar is a {{travelling}} exhibition that first opened on June 28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts.

40|$|Exposure to food {{commercials}} {{on television}} {{is considered to}} be related to elevated snack food intake in front of the television. However, this assumed relation has as yet not been fully established. The present study, therefore examined the direct effects of watching television food commercials on concurrent non-advertised snack food intake in young adults. In addition, possible sex differences were investigated. Participants (N = 82, 50 % male) watched a movie interrupted by two commercial breaks that contained either food commercials or neutral commercials. While <b>watching,</b> <b>they</b> could freely eat crisps and chocolate coated peanuts. Afterwards, participants filled out questionnaires and were weighed and measured. Regression analyses showed that men and women were differently affected by the food commercials. Food intake in women was higher when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> the food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> the neutral commercials, whereas food intake in men was lower when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> the food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> the neutral commercials. The results suggest that especially women are vulnerable for eating more snack food when exposed to food commercials...|$|R

5|$|Waylon Smithers {{is offered}} {{a job at the}} Globex Corporation. When he refuses, the offer is passed down to Homer, the next-longest-employed {{individual}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> a promotional video about the planned community, they agree that it is much better than Springfield. Abandoning their house, the Simpsons pack up and leave town.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> the same episodes all the time, while Lisa {{says that the}} Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

5|$|Surmising the Siren {{is using}} {{water as a}} portal, the Doctor instructs {{everyone}} to seek refuge in the ship's dry magazine. There, they find Toby Avery (Oscar Lloyd), {{the son of the}} ship's captain Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville), who stowed away on the ship in order to join the crew after his mother died, unaware of his father's illicit deeds.

5|$|The trio {{eventually}} {{reach an}} underground temple where the Thugs worship Kali with human sacrifice. <b>They</b> <b>watch</b> as the Thugs chain {{one of their}} victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial fire pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession {{of three of the}} five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also entranced, attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer. The Maharajah then tells Shorty {{how to get out of}} the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones, the village children escape.|$|E
