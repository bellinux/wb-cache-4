5|$|Following the inquest, {{evidence}} came {{to light}} to contradict the version of events presented by the British government at the inquest. Six weeks after {{the conclusion of the}} inquest, a Gibraltar Police operations order leaked; the document listed Inspector Revagliatte, who had claimed to be on routine patrol, unaware of Operation Flavius, and whose siren apparently triggered the shootings, as the commander of two police firearms teams assigned to the operation. In February 1989, British journalists discovered that the IRA team operating in Spain must have contained more members than the three killed in Gibraltar. <b>The</b> <b>staff</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> agencies from which the team rented their vehicles gave the Spanish police descriptions which did not match McCann, Savage, or Farrell; Savage's white Renault, meanwhile, was rented several hours before Savage himself arrived in Spain.|$|E

5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E
5|$|Initial casting for {{the film}} began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly {{selected}} for the lead role. However, <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> AFI had underestimated the project's scale—they had initially green-lit Eraserhead after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production {{for a number of}} years. In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door—a full year passed before he was filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.|$|E
