5|$|In {{the court}} case, {{it was also}} cited that the design for winged <b>toasters</b> was not {{original}} and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying <b>toasters</b> adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm {{was unaware of the}} previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's <b>toasters</b> had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn {{for the use of the}} same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.|$|E
5|$|Judge Eugene Lynch {{found in}} favour of Berkeley, citing that a {{commercial}} software product was {{not subject to the}} same exemptions as parodist literature, and that the <b>toasters</b> were too similar in design. The total cost of the court case and the recalled product was roughly $150,000 U.S.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed <b>toasters</b> to decrease make times; the new <b>toasters,</b> while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{hardcore}} punk was developing primarily in Southern California and Washington, D.C. The New York hardcore scene {{was founded by}} 1981, and bands such as Reagan Youth and Kraut led the initial charge. By 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by straight edgers and skinheads, including bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags, Heart Attack, Youth of Today, The Plasmatics, Warzone, and Murphy's Law. With {{the collapse of the}} CBGB hardcore matinees due to constant violence, a more activist DIY scene began to develop around ABC No Rio and the squats of the Lower East Side. New York has {{been at the center of}} the United States third wave ska scene. The founders of third wave ska, which drew on British Two-Tone ska, were New York bands such as the <b>Toasters</b> and Urban Blight. In the early 1980s, <b>Toasters</b> singer/guitarist and songwriter Robert 'Bucket' Hingley established Moon Ska Records; the label operated until the late 1990s, giving many ska bands from New York and elsewhere international exposure. Some of the other ska bands to come from the New York scene were Skinnerbox, The Slackers, and Mephiskapheles. Other major hardcore punk bands from New York are Sick of It All, H2O, and Madball. There are also ska-jazz bands, such as the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble.|$|E

25|$|In February 2002, The Living End's line up {{changed as}} Demsey left and was {{replaced}} on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted {{to spend more time}} with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller <b>Toasters,</b> Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.|$|E

In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band [...] "spent {{most of the time}} swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music", according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track. They began work in the mid-afternoon and worked into the night, with an after-party following the session. The group collaborated with Sly & Robbie, who produced [...] "Underneath It All" [...] and [...] "Hey Baby" [...] and brought in dancehall <b>toasters</b> Lady Saw and Bounty Killer, and Steely & Clevie, who produced [...] "Start the Fire".|$|E
