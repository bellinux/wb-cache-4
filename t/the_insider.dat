50|$|The {{positions}} {{of these relationships}} are not fixed. If mild to moderate tension develops between <b>the</b> <b>insiders,</b> <b>the</b> most uncomfortable <b>insider</b> will move closer to an outsider. <b>The</b> remaining original <b>insider</b> then switches places with the outsider. <b>The</b> excluded <b>insider</b> becomes <b>the</b> new outsider and the original outsider is now an <b>insider.</b> Predictably <b>the</b> new outsider may move to restore closeness with one of <b>the</b> current <b>insiders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Forging a {{collaboration}} with Scorsese, the two paired {{again for a}} biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and <b>The</b> <b>Insider.</b> The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.|$|E
25|$|Rao {{was paid}} a 1,00,000 advance by David Davidar of Penguin India for {{publication}} rights. The manuscript was edited to exclude {{much of the}} sexual content and Anand substituted Niranjan as the central character. It has been noted that the book draws on material from The Reshuffle, a satirical political skit by Rao that was published by Mainstream in 1984. The book was renamed <b>The</b> <b>Insider,</b> the new title suggested by Kalyani Shankar, political editor at The Hindustan Times. <b>The</b> <b>Insider</b> was released in 1998 by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a function in Delhi that had two former prime ministers and a president in attendance.|$|E

50|$|In both {{examples}} {{anxiety is}} reduced, but neither husband nor wife resolves {{the source of}} their anxiety. Triangles usually have two individuals or entities in conflict, and another entity or individual uninvolved with the conflict is brought in. When tension is not high, the relationship between the first two individuals is desirable. The two original people in the relationship or conflict are the inside positions of <b>the</b> triangle. <b>The</b> <b>insiders</b> bond when they prefer each other, {{but in the case of}} conflict, another entity or individual (the outsider) is brought in. This is an effort by one of <b>the</b> two <b>insiders</b> to either defuse and avoid the situation, or to team up against <b>the</b> other <b>insider.</b> <b>The</b> <b>insiders</b> may actively exclude the outsider when tensions are not low between <b>the</b> <b>insiders.</b> Being excluded may provoke intense feelings of rejection and the outsider works to get closer to one of <b>the</b> <b>insiders.</b>|$|R

40|$|We revisit Kyle’s (Econometrica 53 : 1315 – 1335, 1985) {{model of}} price {{formation}} {{in the presence of}} private information. We begin by using Back’s (Rev Financ Stud 5 (3) : 387 – 409, 1992) approach, demonstrating that if standard assumptions are imposed, the model has a unique equilibrium solution and that <b>the</b> <b>insider’s</b> trading strategy has a martingale property. That in turn implies that <b>the</b> <b>insider’s</b> strategies are linear in total order flow. We also show that for arbitrary prior distributions, <b>the</b> <b>insider’s</b> trading strategy is uniquely determined by a Doob -transform that expresses <b>the</b> <b>insider’s</b> informational advantage. This allows us to reformulate the model so that Kyle’s liquidity parameter TeX is characterized by a Lagrange multiplier that is the marginal value or shadow price of information. Based on these findings, we can then interpret liquidity as the marginal value of information...|$|R

25|$|After Big Brother {{revealed}} to the other housemates that Michael was <b>the</b> <b>Insider,</b> and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna who had little contact with her father. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben {{is the name of}} one of Michael's real life friends. Despite no longer being <b>the</b> <b>Insider,</b> Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts {{as to whether or not}} there is another insider inside the house besides Michael.
