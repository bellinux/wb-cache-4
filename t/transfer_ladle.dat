5000|$|Transfer ladle: a ladle used to {{transfer}} {{a large amount}} of molten metal from one process to another. Typically a <b>transfer</b> <b>ladle</b> will be used {{to transfer}} molten metal from a primary melting furnace to either an holding furnace or an auto-pour unit.|$|E
40|$|Ladle {{metallurgical}} processes {{constitute a}} portion of the total production chain of steel from iron ore. With these batch processes, the hot metal or steel <b>transfer</b> <b>ladle</b> is being used as a reactor vessel and a reagent is often injected in order to bring the composition of the hot metal or steel to the specification of the final product. To control and further improve these processes, often use is made of models that predict the course of the processes. Models derived from first principles of mass and energy transport have the advantage over empirical descriptions that predictions outside the established window of operation can be made. The establishment of such a model, however, requires deeper knowledge of the underlying thermo-chemical processes. The purpose of this work is to provide a uniform method {{for the development of a}} model of injection processes in the ladle metallurgy. This will give direction to the development of new models, and will clarify blind spots in the existing knowledge for which further research is required. It is chosen to study two ladle treatments and to develop a reactor model of these, namely the desulphurisation of hot metal by the injection of magnesium and lime, and the modification of inclusions in aluminium killed steel by the injection of calcium. The hot metal desulphurisation has been studied by microscopic analysis of hot metal samples taken during different heats. The top layer of the bath, where the hot metal is in contact with the slag layer, has also been studied. From these analyses, it follows that during the injection of magnesium, magnesium sulphide particles are formed which continue to be present for some time in the hot metal, grow and later on rise out of the bath. This corresponds to the mechanism as has been proposed by G. Irons and R. Guthrie, based on their experiments on a laboratory scale. Due to the differences in scale, however, the accumulation of magnesium sulphide particles in the hot metal plays a significant role in the explanation of sulphur levels observed in the industrial desulphurisation process. The measurements furthermore show that the rise of the particles to the slag layer is partially obstructed by graphite and Ti (C, N) particles that accumulate in the colder surface layer of the hot metal. This creates a layer with a high concentration of MgS-particles that remain unnoticed but can lead to undesirable sulphur pick up in the converter process. It also appears that the MgS particles that rise to the slag layer react with co-injected lime to form MgO and CaS. In order to prevent sulphur reversal by oxidation of MgS in the ambient air, lime should always be injected in a slight excess. During the injection process, iron droplets are thrown up from the spout area. These droplets slowly sink through the slag layer and do not make it back to the hot metal before the end of the injection process. Based on this it can be explained how the hot metal loss depends on the amount of injected magnesium, the hot metal temperature, and the hot metal titanium content. Because these droplets are entrained with the sulphide containing slag during deslagging, this presents a major cost in the form of loss of hot metal. Based on these findings, a reactor model of the hot metal desulphurisation has been developed The mixing in the hot metal bath has been described as an ideally mixed tank reactor, wherein the residence time of injected magnesium and lime has been described by a generic model of the bubble plume. An important aspect of the model is that the total sulphur content is formed by the sulphur that is dissolved in the hot metal and the sulphur which is bound in the MgS particles suspended in the hot metal. The specific surface area of the MgS particles is derived from the microscopic observations and the flotation of the MgS particles is described by a first order rate equation. The predicted development of the concentrations of magnesium and sulphur during the duration of the injection is in good agreement with the measurements which have been made with two treatments. The calcium treatment of aluminium killed steel has been extensively studied by W. Tiekink. Based on the measurements carried out by him on laboratory and industrial scale, the steel bath in the ladle is divided into two reaction zones: a zone plume in which the steel is saturated with calcium and a bulk zone in which initially no calcium is present. In the plume zone CaO and CaS are deposited on the Al 2 O 3 particles. Induced by the bubble plume resulting from the calcium injection, a circulating current flows between these zones. Each zone is modelled by a continuously stirred, ideally mixed tank reactor (CISTR). Carried along with this circulating current, the particles are alternately exposed to high and low levels of calcium activity which ultimately results in a variation in size and composition of the particles. This is modelled by taking a population balance of the particles for each zone containing terms for convection and growth by deposition of CaO and CaS. The results of the model are consistent with the observations when it is assumed that the solubility of calcium in steel amounts to 1 ppm. There is a good prediction of particle sizes and composition, but the CaS content of the particles is slightly overestimated by the model. This is explained by the pick up of oxygen at the surface of the steel which is not yet taken into account in the model. The final conclusion of this work is that the chemical conversion of the hot metal and steel during ladle metallurgical injection processes can be well modelled with a detailed description of nucleation, growth and rise of the product particles in conjunction with a relatively simple macroscopic description of the flow field in the ladle. This can best be achieved by providing a population balance of the product particles in which, to the extent appropriate, terms for nucleation, growth, convection and flotation are included. The flow field in the ladle then is modelled using three CISTR's coupled by circulating currents of liquid metal. These CISTR's represent the three zones that can be distinguished in a ladle stirred by a bubble plume; the plume zone, the recirculation zone and the stagnant zone above the bottom of the ladle. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The mass <b>transfer</b> rate during <b>ladle</b> {{refining}} was quantified {{by taking}} sequential steel and slag samples during {{the treatment of}} 20 heats. Each heat was stirred with a different argon flow rate, ranging between 0 and 63 scfm. Heats were treated at two different plants. Al-killed steel was produced at an LMF in 151 -t ladles. Si-deoxidized steel was produced at an LMF in 123 -t <b>ladles.</b> Mass <b>transfer</b> rate constants were determined for each heat by using process simulation (Metsim) and thermodynamic (FactSage) models.

The necessary refining time decreases if the newly-defined specific steel transport rate is maximized and the slag has a low basicity and FeO concentration before the start of de-S...|$|R
5000|$|The Hot Metal Bridge is a {{truss bridge}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that crosses the Monongahela River. The bridge {{consists}} of two parallel spans on a single set of piers: the former Monongahela Connecting Railroad Bridge, built in 1887, on the upstream side and the former Hot Metal Bridge, built in 1900, on the downstream side. The Monongahela Connecting Railroad Bridge carried conventional railroad traffic, while the Hot Metal Bridge connected parts of the J&L Steel mill, carrying crucibles of molten iron from the blast furnaces in <b>ladle</b> <b>transfer</b> cars to the open hearth furnaces on the opposite bank to be converted to steel. During World War II 15% of America's steel making capacity crossed over the Hot Metal Bridge, up to 180 tons per hour. The upstream span was converted to road use after a $14.6 million restoration, and opened by Mayor Murphy with a ceremony honoring former steel workers on June 23, 2000. [...] The bridge connects 2nd Avenue at the Pittsburgh Technology Center in South Oakland with Hot Metal Street (South 29th Street) in the South Side. The downstream span reopened for pedestrian and bicycle use in late 2007 {{after two years of}} work. The Great Allegheny Passage hiker/biker trail passes over this bridge as it approaches Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle area.|$|R
40|$|Gas {{stirring}} {{is commonly}} applied in {{secondary steel making}} and the objectives of stirring is to enhance heat and mass <b>transfer</b> inside the <b>ladle</b> to achieve homogenization of temperature and composition, facilitate slag-metal interactions, and accelerate the removal of inclusions in the steel, however, {{it is difficult to}} monitor the stirring effect using just the gas line pressure and the volume flow rate due to leakages between the connectors and hook-ups. An intermittent view of the top disturbed surface has to be applied to monitor the stirring conditions during the actual operations, in which, the subjective judgement of the operator is required to control the stirring process. Acoustic technology and vibration analysis to monitor and control steelmaking process have found increasing application in recent years. It has been found that the sound emitted during certain metallurgical operations reflects the corresponding operating conditions and thus the acoustic response may be used to monitor and control the process. Vibration detectors have been used to determine the degree of stirring in a ladle in industry. Stelco and Nupro Corporation have used vibration sensors on the wall of ladles as a basis for ladle control systems and positive results have been reported by using vibration analysis to control gas flow into the ladle. However, no investigation has been reported that combined all the signals simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} foundry {{not only}} frequently uses batch melting, where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, sometimes {{as long as a}} complete shift, but also uses the gravity sand casting process where the molten aluminium alloys are <b>transferred</b> using a <b>ladle</b> from furnace to pour station and are poured into a mould. During the filling of the mould, the turbulent nature of the liquid metal gives rise to massive entrainment of the surface oxide films which are the subsequently trapped into the liquid and act as micro cracks. Also the long exposure time of the liquid surface to the surrounding environment during melting, transferring and filling will increase the level of hydrogen absorption from the atmosphere. The abovementioned factors are often the main reasons for casting defect generation. In this paper the novel CRIMSON aluminium casting method is introduced which has a number of advantages. Instead of gravity filling method, it uses the single shot upcasting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid counter-gravity-filling mould operations which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation. Another advantage is the drastic reduction of energy consumption due to shortened melting and filling time. A simulation software, FLOW- 3 D, is used to compare this new method with the conventional gravity casting process. A tensile bar case is used as a sample to simulate the filling process...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{is universally}} {{present in all}} steels, and {{although}} its solubility under normal steelmaking conditions is small it can exert large effects on steel properties. Some of these effects are detrimental, often being associated with various embrittlement phenomena. This has led to liquid steel refining processes designed, amongst other things, to decrease the nitrogen content. However nitrogen also has beneficial effects, and since it is abundant and cheap, different steels containing enhanced nitrogen have been developed, Nitrogen levels obtained in the traditional steelmaking processes are well established. In the present investigation a detailed study of the origin and control of nitrogen in the New Zealand Steel iron and steelmaking process has been studied. The progress of 18 individual heats was followed by collecting samples at successive processing stages, and {{an attempt was made}} to correlate the observed nitrogen with recorded process variables. It was found that hot metal from the melters had an average nitrogen content of 0. 002 % and a further increase in nitrogen content was observed at VRU. However, there was a drop in nitrogen content after oxygen blowing in the KOBM. It is suggested that nitrogen in solution in the liquid steel is absorbed into gas bubbles passing through the steel bath giving a flushing action, consequently carbon monoxide bubbles formed during oxygen lancing will effectively reduce the nitrogen content. There was a significant increase in nitrogen content between the KOBM samples and LTS samples, and a further increase in nitrogen content was observed in the GGM samples. These increases at the LTS and CCM seem to result from the absorption of nitrogen during tapping, <b>transferring</b> the <b>ladle</b> to the LTS and teeming at the CCM where there is little protection of the molten stream from the atmosphere and consequential nitrogen absorption. This investigation examines the effect of thermal treatments on the precipitation of vanadium nitride in high strength, low alloy steels. The thermal cycle of a hot rolling strip mill has been simulated in the laboratory and precipitation of vanadium nitride studied. The solubility of vanadium nitride in high strength, low alloy type steels was determined for temperatures from 900 °C - 1250 °C, and the ferrite grain size after the simulated thermal cycle determined. Change in yield strength, charpy transition temperature and strain age propensity as a result of vanadium nitride precipitation, have also been determined. The effect of a normalizing heat treatment subsequent to the simulated thermal cycle was also examined. Analysed Ninsol suggests that the precipitation of vanadium nitride is rapid in the high temperature ferrite phase range, and is diffusion controlled. Peak precipitation of vanadium nitride has been shown to occur at a simulated coiling temperature of 700 °C for the high strength, low alloy steels examined. Minimum ferrite grain size for the simulated thermal cycle, and for samples subsequently normalized, suggest that vanadium nitride formed in the ferrite phase dominates the subsequent ferrite grain size. The mechanical properties of these high strength, low alloy steels {{have been shown to be}} dependent on both grain size and vanadium nitride precipitated during the simulated hot rolling thermal cycle. Nitrogen also has an influence on the microstructure and properties of dual phase steels. Nitrogen increases the hardenability of the austenite phase formed at intercritical annealing temperature by partitioning. Manganese retards the partitioning of nitrogen by forming atom pairs within the iron lattice and providing low energy sites for nitrogen atoms. In this present investigation the partitioning of nitrogen has been investigated for a range of steels with manganese contents up to 1. 5 %. Significant partitioning of both nitrogen and manganese was shown to occur during the intercritical annealing heat treatment. Partitioning of nitrogen in low manganese steels was shown to be rapid, but with increased managanese content, partitioning of nitrogen retarded. This retardation was proportional to the manganese content. The effect of manganese partitioning on the formation of dual phase microstructure has also been examined...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in casting steel. This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the steel foundries both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American steel foundries as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in steel foundry furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the steel foundry refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for steel foundries. Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the steel foundry industry, and a shift from pre-fired materials (shaped refractories) to monolithic refractories that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace tap temperature would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the <b>ladle</b> <b>transfer</b> portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the formation and evolution of non-metallic inclusions during ingot casting. Emphasize have been on understanding the types of inclusions formed and developed through the casting process and {{on the development of}} already existing inclusions carried over from the ladle during casting. Industrial experiments carried on at Uddeholm Tooling together with laboratory work and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Ingots of 5. 8 tons have been sampled and the types of inclusions together with their distribution within the ingot have been characterized. Two new types of inclusions have been found. Type C 1 is found originated from casting powder and in the size from a few μm to 30 μm. Type C 2 is of macro inclusion type sizing up to 70 μm. The presence of C 2 inclusions are few but very detrimental for the quality of the steel. Both types, C 1 and C 2 consist of alumina, indicating that reoxidation is the main reason for their existence. The protecting argon shroud has been studied by the use of a 1 : 1 scaled 2 D model. Both flow pattern and oxygen measurement have been carried out. CFD has also been used as an auxiliary tool. It has been found that the oxygen pickup through argon gas shroud depends mostly on the distance between the ladle and the collar placed on top of runner. Further increase of gas flow rate above 2. 5 m 3. h- 1 had very little effect on the oxygen distribution since both the flushing effect and the entraining effect with respect to oxygen are enhanced by further increase of inert gas flow rate. In the case of dual gas inlet, the flow in the shroud was found much less diffused compared with either vertical or horizontal injection system. The oxygen content in this arrangement was also greatly reduced. Studies of the runner after casting revealed a sparse non-metallic network structure around the periphery of the steel rod remained in the runner. The surface of the refractory had been severely attacked by the mechanical force from the streaming steel. The erosions of the centre stone and the end stone were on the other hand negligible. CFD calculations showed that the flow at those locations is almost stagnant. The surface of the refractory in contact with the steel was found to have an increased content of alumina. The source for the alumina could come from either exchange reaction of dissolved aluminium replaces the silica or reoxidation products origin from oxygen pick up during the <b>transfer</b> from the <b>ladle</b> to the vertical runner. Inclusions were also found entrapped in the steel refractory interface. It was also found that a formation of a liquid slag film as early as possible during casting would increase the possibility to remove inclusions and especially inclusions generated by the casting powder.
