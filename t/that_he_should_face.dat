As they halted, spellbound, to breathe {{mountain}} air, to drink salt breeze, Isabel again looked at her husband. He was smiling in sensuous pleasure. It came to her joyously that time alone could heal his wounded spirit. It seemed manly {{that he should be}} able to delight in his present environment without prejudice; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>face</b> phases of Catholic power without pain. It were preposterous to try to wipe out the realm of Romish influence; for to do that meant to give up [...] "old world" [...] cathedrals and universal art, inspired by popes and cardinals. Yes, Philip was wise to tread his new way freely as a free man.|$|E

When Mick found a letter to Leo from Adele, he questioned his son and that's when he discovered that Leo and Adele had sex. Mick was furious and afterwards, told Leo <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>face</b> up to his responsibilities. After realising however that this could end {{his career in the}} police he decided the best thing was for Leo to move to London as soon as possible. Shortly afterwards Leo left.|$|E

500|$|Following the emigration, {{the people}} of Mecca seized {{property}} of Muslim emigrants to Medina. War would later break out between {{the people of}} Mecca and the Muslims. Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans (see sura Al-Hajj, Quran [...] ). According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be <b>facing</b> Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer. Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer.|$|R

He quoted Tora as requesting that [...] "any punishment meted out by the court be directed towards me and me only and not to any other of my co-accused." [...] He appealed, however, for leniency to be shown to Tora on account of his old age.|$|E
5000|$|On June 24, 2008, the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal {{ruled against}} extraditing Bacar to the Comoros. With all his appeals exhausted, Bacar, his brother, {{and two of}} his men were {{expelled}} from Réunion on the morning of July 19. They were taken to Cotonou, Benin, on a French government flight; the Beninese government had agreed to allow Bacar to stay in Benin. Bacar said that on this occasion that he intended to stay there for as long as his presence was allowed, and he expressed a desire to [...] "reflect on our past errors". Comoran government spokesman Abdourahim Said Bakar said that the government was [...] "disappointed" [...] by the expulsion of Bacar to Benin, reiterating the government's position <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>face</b> trial in the Comoros or before an international court.|$|E
50|$|Dastak is {{the story}} of a mentally {{unstable}} genius (Sharad Kapoor) and his obsession for the Miss Universe (Sushmita Sen). Sharad is so obsessed with Sushmita that he starts killing her near and dear ones in order to get to her. Eventually he kidnaps Sushmita and takes her to a distant isolated island in Seychelles. There, he makes her life miserable. Sushmita tries every trick to get out of this hell. But ultimately, everything falls apart. Sushmita tries to reform Sharad by telling him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>face</b> his problems rather than inflicting the same physical and mental pain (that he went through in his childhood) on other people. But Sharad refuses to listen and amend his ways. In the climax, he tries to kill Sushmita because she does not love him. At the end, Sushmita kills Sharad in self-defense. She writes and dedicates it to people like Sharad.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped in}} the street and looked at him. This was a state of things of which she had never dreamed. She could imagine that a man should wish to put it off, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have the <b>face</b> to declare to his young woman <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never meant to marry at all, was a thing that she could not understand. What {{business}} had such a man to go after any young woman? 'And what do you mean that I'm to do, Sir Felix?' she said.|$|R
50|$|In order <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be <b>faced</b> with an hostile Assembly, {{dominated}} by the parties (as {{was the case in}} 1945-1946), De Gaulle let his followers organize a political party, the Union for the New Republic (Union pour la nouvelle république or UNR). After the November 1958 legislative election, it became the largest force in the political system. It was allied with center-left and center-right parties to support De Gaulle, who was elected President of France by a congress of local and national elects in December 1958. Michel Debré was nominated as Prime minister.|$|R

She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stain his <b>face</b> brown, and they should run away together; but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gipsies were thieves, and hardly got anything to eat, and had nothing to drive but a donkey. To-day, however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gipsydom was her only refuge, and she rose from her seat on {{the roots of the}} tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life.|$|R
5000|$|Album opener [...] "Real Man" [...] (which {{featured}} all of {{the original}} members of Utopia except for M. Frog Labat) and the modulated a capella [...] "Born to Synthesize" [...] have Rundgren acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>face</b> himself and follow his dreams of experimenting more with music than creating conventional pop records. [...] "The Death of Rock and Roll", ironically the hardest rocking song on the record, takes a stab at the critics that rejected his previous rock albums A Wizard, a True Star and Todd. At the same time, Rundgren was also experimenting with Eastern religious concepts, exploring these themes on [...] "Eastern Intrigue", as well as forming the basis of [...] "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire". The closing tracks of the first side, the [...] "disco-prog" [...] title track and the soul music-inspired [...] "Fair Warning", cryptically state that Rundgren is ready to push forward {{and that it is}} up to the listener to follow along or tune out.|$|E

[Sidenote: Sir Launcelot awakens Sir Tristram] Therewith {{he reached}} forward and touched Sir Tristram very {{gently on the}} shoulder, and at that Sir Tristram awoke and {{opened his eyes and}} sat up. And Sir Tristram looked upon Sir Launcelot, but knew him not, albeit some small memory moved very deeply within him. Nevertheless, though he knew not Sir Launcelot, yet he felt great {{tenderness}} for that noble knight in arms, and he smiled very lovingly upon him. And Sir Launcelot felt in return a very great deal of regard for Sir Tristram, but wist not why that was; yet it seemed to Sir Launcelot <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> know the <b>face</b> of Sir Tristram, and that it was not altogether strange to him.|$|R
50|$|He is the Dash Warriors' second {{member and}} his mini4wd is the Dash-2 Burning Sun. Tankuro is a stout and very kind boy, even {{if at the}} {{beginning}} when he meets Yonkuro he seems a bit grumpy. His golden heart and his sacrifice spirit will reveal important to his team to access to the Mini4wd national tournament, despite his machine is not very fast. The quality and the style of Tankuro and his car are represented {{by the power of}} the car itself: increasing such power to the maximum at the expense of speed, the Dash-2 Burning Sun can be defined doubtlessly the most powerful and resistant car of the team. Shortly before the national finals, Tankuro will leave the team at the moment, realising of his opponents' strength and the not exaggerated confidence in him demonstrated by Yonkuro. He is seen again in the Momotaro team, the team <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have <b>faced</b> in the finals, but his was not a betrayal: Tankuro, in fact took advantage of the situation to learn the use of the Front Motor chassis (F.M. Chassis) and to build Dash-2 Burning Sun's evolution, the Dash-02 Neo Burning Sun, a Mini4wd made even more powerful and innovative thanks to the then innovation of the front motor. During the last acts of the final race, in the attempt of crossing for first the finish line in the top of a building, he will use the condenser circuit of Pankuro's Dash-4 Cannonball, resulting in his mini4wd breaking into pieces after a few meters, but this sacrifice will be useful to Yonkuro, that thinks up an idea to win the race. At the end of the saga, during a reunion with the former teammates, all of them now grown up, he makes his last appearance.|$|R
6000|$|Maggie's intentions, as usual, were on {{a larger}} scale than Tom imagined. The {{resolution}} that gathered in her mind, after Tom and Lucy had walked away, was not so simple as that of going home. No! she would run away and go to the gypsies, and Tom should never see her any more. That was by no means a new idea to Maggie; she had been so often told she was like a gypsy, and [...] "half wild," [...] that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium, and being entirely in harmony with circumstances, would be to live in a little brown tent on the commons; the gypsies, she considered, would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge. She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stain his <b>face</b> brown, and they should run away together; but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gypsies were thieves, and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey. To-day however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her refuge, and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life; she would run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common, where there would certainly be gypsies; and cruel Tom, and the rest of her relations who found fault with her, should never see her any more. She thought of her father as she ran along, but she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him, by determining that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where she was, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always loved him very much.|$|R
