40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the pharmaceutical industry {{gave birth to the}} needs of pharmaceutical <b>technology</b> <b>brokerage.</b> At present, brokerage in China on the management of pharmaceutical technology is more vague and confusing. Also construction of its management is still empty. In view of this, the authors make a comprehensive analysis on contemporary social influential factors and comprehensive management mode related, and put forward a realistic selection for comprehensive management mode of pharmaceutical <b>technology</b> <b>brokerage</b> by taking into consideration of the theory of “choice club”. That is, the main mode of management of “hexagon” which is centered by self-discipline, with supplement of internal restraint, government regulation, ethical standardization, social supervision and legal control in pharmaceutical technology assisted brokerage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the role that Technology Parks can play in {{regional}} development by supporting technological innovation of companies {{in the region of}} Northern Greece. Through a series of studies and contacts with local industry we have established a base for industry’s technological demands. This has determined the services that the Technology Transfer Unit of Thessaloniki Technology Park could provide to the firms in the region including information dissemination, <b>technology</b> <b>brokerage,</b> partner searching, linking industry to research. A description of these services is given with the listing of the necessary tools for successful running of these services. We discuss the problems we have encountered when developing and offering these services and present specific examples of implementation of such services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} a study on the urge and willingness of Nigerian researchers to patent their inventions. The study focused on Pharmaceutical studies, Food Science and Technology, and Metallurgy and Materials Science in universities. The study revealed that the Nigerian government was the major financier of research activities of the researchers, some of who had generated some inventions/research breakthroughs. The study found that about 95 % of the researchers were willing to patent their inventions, but about 10 % of them had applied for patents. Researchers in pharmaceutical studies were most active in patenting of inventions, followed by those in Food Science and Technology, and least in Metallurgy and Materials Studies. Busy schedules of the researchers, ignorance of procedure of obtaining patents for inventions, waiting time for the grant of patent, and government sponsorship of the researches that generated the inventions, discouraged the researchers from patenting the inventions. The researchers had poor knowledge of patents and did not consult patent documents {{in the course of their}} research activities. The study concluded that inadequate information on patent matters, lack of institutional infrastructure and unfavourable patent ownership structure led to the poor patenting culture among Nigerian researchers. To address the problems, it is recommended that adequate patent education should be mounted in Nigerian institutions. <b>Technology</b> <b>brokerage</b> organisations should also be established in the institutions, while the government is urged to offer part-ownership of patents to researchers and the institutions/institutes, where they are generated. 1...|$|E

40|$|Academic inventors are {{university}} {{scientists who}} appear as designated inventors of patents owned either by business companies, academic institutions or individuals. We analyse {{their relationships with}} co-inventors, who may be either academic colleagues, students, or, very often, industrial researchers. Gould and Fernandez's (1989) taxonomy of 'brokerage' roles is adjusted to patent data, and complemented with information drawn from both academic inventors' publications and replies to a short questionnaire. Only very few academic inventors are found to hold brokerage positions. Such inventors have {{a large number of}} patents, a strong publication record and a higher-than-average share of patents held by companies, rather than universities. Relationships of academic inventors with co-inventors from industry are weaker and less likely to be maintained than those with co-inventors from academia. Academic inventors in gatekeeping positions (between university and industry) maintain the strongest ties with all types of co-inventors.

40|$|The {{linear model}} of {{innovation}} has been superseded {{by a variety}} of theoretical models that view the innovation process as systemic, complex, multi-level, multi-temporal, involving a plurality of heterogeneous economic agents. Accordingly, the emphasis of the policy discourse has changed over time. The focus has shifted from the direct public funding of basic research as an engine of innovation, to the creation of markets for knowledge goods, to, eventually, the acknowledgement that knowledge transfer very often requires direct interactions among innovating actors. In most cases, policy interventions attempt to facilitate the match between “demand” and “supply” of the knowledge needed to innovate. A complexity perspective calls for a different framing, one focused on the fostering of processes characterized by multiple agency levels, multiple temporal scales, ontological uncertainty and emergent outcomes. This contribution explores what it means to design interventions in support of innovation processes inspired by a complex systems perspective. It does so by analyzing two examples of coordinated interventions: a public policy funding innovating networks (with SMEs, research centers and university), and a private initiative, promoted by a network of medium-sized mechanical engineering firms, that supports innovation by means of <b>technology</b> <b>brokerage.</b> Relying on two unique datasets recording the interactions of the organizations involved in these interventions, social network analysis and qualitative research are combined in order to investigate network dynamics and the roles of specific actors in fostering innovation processes. Then, some general implications for the design of coordinated interventions supporting innovation in a complexity perspective are drawn...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} investment optimization using genetic control. Time series for stock values are obtained from data available on the www and asset prices are predicted using adaptive algorithms. A portfolio is optimized with the genetic algorithm based on a recursive model of portfolio composition obtained on-the-fly using genetic programming. These two steps are integrated into an automatic system- the final result is a real-time system for updating portfolio composition for each asset. Introduction. IBM and other companies are undertaking massive studies on the application of advanced computing <b>technologies</b> to stock <b>brokerage</b> and obtaining better results than the New York stock market’s sharpest traders [1].

40|$|The {{goal of the}} InfoSleuth {{project at}} MCC is to exploit and {{synthesize}} new technologies into a uni ed system that retrieves and processes information in an ever-changing network of information sources. InfoSleuth {{has its roots in}} the Carnot project at MCC, which specialized in integrating heterogeneous information bases. However, recent emerging technologies such asinternetworking and the World Wide Web have signi cantly expanded the types, availability, and volume of data available to an information management system. Furthermore, in these new environments, there is no formal control over the registration of new information sources, and applications tend to be developed without complete knowledge of the resources that will be available when they are run. Federated database projects such as Carnot that do static data integration do not scale up and do not cope well with this ever-changing environment. On the other hand, recent Web technologies, based on keyword search engines, are scalable but, unlike federated databases, are incapable of accessing information based on concepts. In this experience paper, we describe the architecture, design, and implementation of a working version of InfoSleuth. We show how InfoSleuth integrates new technological developments such as agent <b>technology,</b> domain ontologies, <b>brokerage,</b> and internet computing, in support of mediated interoperation of data and services in a dynamic and open environment. We demonstrate the use of information brokering and domain ontologies as key elements for scalability. ...|$|R
