On December 9, 2010, Revolution Software announced the release of Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered on Apple iOS devices, and was finally released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.|$|E

25|$|From her {{experiences}} as a psychiatrist, Horney named ten patterns of neurotic needs. These ten needs are based upon things which she <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> humans require to succeed in life. Horney modified these needs somewhat to correspond with what she believed were individuals' neuroses. A neurotic person could theoretically exhibit all of these needs, though in practice much fewer than the ten here need to be present {{for a person to}} be considered a neurotic.|$|E
25|$|Even though Indra is {{declared}} as {{the king}} of gods in some verses, there is no consistent subordination of other gods to Indra. In Vedic <b>thought,</b> <b>all</b> gods and goddesses are equivalent and aspects of the same eternal abstract Brahman, none consistently superior, none consistently inferior. All gods obey Indra, but all gods also obey Varuna, Vishnu, Rudra and others when the situation arises. Further, Indra also accepts and follows the instructions of Savitr (sun-god). Indra, like all Vedic deities, {{is a part of}} henotheistic theology of ancient India.|$|E

McCusker also opined that the serial's romances were [...] "relatively {{straightforward}} affairs"; but <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> that changed with the Frank/Roo/Bobby storyline. A columnist from TV Life said that Papps was the [...] "resident heart-throb" [...] and Frank did not have a problem free life and was much [...] "better at guitar than academic work". Sinead O'Neil from The Sun said that getting [...] "ditched not hitched" [...] was a classic soap cliff-hanger and included Frank and Roo's wedding on their list.|$|E

Maria was then faced with rearing four children in more rural, less favorable living conditions. For his part, Tucker was disappointed with an absence of the desired social life. While he <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> his neighbors [...] "friendly and civil", they were also [...] "unpolished and plain". With an increased effort in his law practice, Tucker discovered more success and acquired more clients, spread across four counties. He was also elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Pittsylvania county. Maria gave birth to daughter Lelia in October 1810 and Harriett in May 1813.|$|E
500|$|In the {{assessment}} of Celticist Nora Chadwick, [...] "the tale is told with brilliant narrative power": its terseness, humour and laconic brevity {{is reminiscent of the}} best of the Icelandic sagas. The dialogue is particularly masterly in its [...] "understatement and crisp repartee", with [...] "the utmost condensation and economy" [...] in its choice of words. [...] "n the few remarks made by Mac Da Thó to his visitors, all his previous train of <b>thought,</b> <b>all</b> his cunning and address, are suggested in a few brief words intended by him to hide his true designs from his guests, while suggesting to ourselves his hidden intention." ...|$|E

Sepinwall said he <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> the supporting characters were excellent, and that he particularly liked the new adversarial dynamic between Michael and Dwight. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "This was the episode I've been waiting for weeks." [...] She said she particularly enjoyed many of the subplots involving Kelly's clothing, Creed's chess game with Jim and Toby dealing with casual Friday problems. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Casual Friday" [...] a B+ grade, and said the episode had good character moments and a bit of dramatic depth in addition to a few good laughs.|$|E

500|$|In 1898 {{and again}} in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and {{wrote a book about}} his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, {{enabling}} the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. [...] "For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Daily News critic Sandra Barrera rated Vivo {{four out}} of four stars commenting while the album {{may be viewed as}} [...] "another attempt by the record-breaking artist at glorifying himself as the king of Latin pop prima donnas", she noted that it [...] "doesn't detract from the {{gorgeous}} body of work". She also <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> of the record's tracks [...] "represent the best of Miguel" [...] and noted the Romance medleys [...] "best illustrate why Miguel is the top-selling pop singer in Latin America". Richard Torres of Newsday wrote a positive review of the record noting Miguel's vocals are [...] "deeper and gruffer than on his studio albums" [...] which he felt gives the uptempo songs [...] "a deeper, funkier edge". He praised Miguel's ballads [...] "sublime", the bolero medleys, and the mariachi songs, concluding: [...] "Miguel's the best purveyor of love songs around, and Vivo captures the best at his best." ...|$|E

In the end, however, the band members warmed to the pair, and concluded a successful session. [...] "We did the three or four cuts that Todd had brought us up to do, and we shook hands with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single. After [...] "Love My Way" [...] played, Kaylan and Volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it. [...] "We have got to sing on this one," [...] Kaylan recalls thinking. [...] "If we don't sing on this one, we're not gonna sing on the hit. This is the fucking hit!" [...] The background vocals that Flo & Eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of the highlights of their lengthy career.|$|E

His campaign promise was that, if elected, he would resign. Every week, from Memorial Day through Election Day, Rogers caricatured the farcical humors of grave campaign politics. On election day he declared victory and resigned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} to read The Magician's Nephew first [...] {{is for the}} chronological order of events, and that, as every story teller knows, is quite {{unimportant}} as a reason.

2500|$|Lowell {{attended}} Harvard College for two years. While he was {{a freshman}} at Harvard, he visited Robert Frost in Cambridge and asked for feedback on a long poem he had written on the Crusades; Frost suggested that Lowell needed {{to work on his}} compression. In an interview, Lowell recalled, [...] "I had a huge blank verse epic on the First Crusade and took it to him all in my undecipherable pencil-writing, and he read a little of it, and said, 'It goes on rather a bit, doesn't it?' And then he read me the opening of Keats's 'Hyperion,' the first version, and I <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> of that was sublime." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy {{states that}} Hume [...] "wrote forcefully and incisively {{on almost every}} central {{question}} {{in the philosophy of}} religion." [...] His [...] "various writings concerning problems of religion are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic." [...] His writings in this field cover the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious <b>thought.</b> <b>All</b> of these aspects were discussed in Hume's 1757 dissertation, The Natural History of Religion. Here he argued that the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier polytheistic religions. He also suggested that all religious belief [...] "traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown." [...] Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first Enquiry, as well as later in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.|$|E
2500|$|The French medievalist Joseph Bédier <b>thought</b> <b>all</b> the Tristan legends {{could be}} traced to a single {{original}} poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the [...] "Ur-Tristan", and wrote his still-popular Romance of Tristan and Iseult {{as an attempt to}} reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, Common Branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, Bédier relied heavily on Eilhart, Béroul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. Some scholars still consider Bédier's argument convincing. A new English translation of Bédier's Roman de Tristan et Iseut (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by Hilaire Belloc, first published in 1913, was republished in 2005.|$|E
