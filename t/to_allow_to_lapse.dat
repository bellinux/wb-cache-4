40|$|The UK-IPO {{is seeking}} views {{on whether to}} {{maintain}} the existing derogation for a further two years until 1 January 2012 or <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the derogation <b>to</b> <b>lapse</b> and for works by artists who are deceased, but are still protected by copyright, {{to be eligible for}} resale right. Resale right was introduced into the UK in 2006 when Directive 2001 / 84 /EC was implemented. Resale right allows artists and their heirs to receive a small royalty each time one of their works is resold whilst that work is in copyright. The UK currently uses a derogation in the Directive so the right only applies in the UK to works by living artists. This derogation will expire on 1 January 2010 unless the UK Government seeks a further two year extension in accordance with the terms of the Directive.

40|$|In this paper, we {{revisit the}} 2009 - 2012 episode in which Ofgem imposed a {{non-discrimination}} clause on large retailers in the UK energy market. The Standard Licence Condition 25 A (SLC 25 A) {{was introduced to}} prevent suppliers from charging their incumbent customers higher prices than their out-of-area customers. The SLC 25 A included a “sunset clause”, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the condition <b>to</b> <b>lapse</b> three years after its implementation. Several IO economists protested that the prohibition of spatial price discrimination would eventually lead to competition weakening. At {{the end of the}} three-year period, Ofgem decided not to renew SLC 25 A for any period. To further our understanding of Ofgem’s motives and its opponents’ arguments, we build a model where two local monopolists compete on a third market. We determine conditions where the obligation to set the same price {{in and out of the}} local market can result in a better or a worse situation for consumers. We show that even when the ban on price discrimination weakens competition, the average consumer can be better off...|$|R
40|$|The Parthlans, {{heirs to}} the Seleucld empire, yet hardly touched by Hellenism, had a tough, nomadic {{background}} which {{enabled them to}} resist any Imposition of the traditional client-patron relationship of Roman foreign policy. Though socially and politically de centralized, the Parthlans were yet able to defeat Crassus, twice Invade Syria, and later turn back an Invasion by Antonlus. Augustus, neither a pacific consolidator nor a world-conqueror, maintained a flexible policy toward Parthla. Conquest was not a prudent aim, yet {{the stability of the}} eastern possessions. of the Roman Empire required that Rome be in a position superior to Parthla. For a time Augustus carried on a policy (begun. In fact, by Antonlus) of supporting a rival to the Parthlan throne, but this brought no long-term success. The return of Crassus' captured standards, which would symbolize Parthla' s submission, was effected In 20 B. C. but only after Augustus seriously threatened war and seized Armenia. Maintaining an effective suzerainty In Armenia, whose strategic and prestige value was great, became the crux of Augustus policy. This policy was adhered <b>to</b> by Tiberius, <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>lapse</b> by Caligula, and then was revived by Claudius. But In Nero's reign, amid altered circumstances in both East and West, a Parthlan nominee was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> sit on the Armenian throne. Peace followed, but Vespasian felt the need to fortify the frontier, and. In effect, made the preparations for Trajan's solution to the reawakened feud: conquest and annexation. Despite his military successes, Trajan could not stabilize the situation: Hadrian felt compelled to withdraw. The violence continued on this frontier even long after the Parthlans had been replaced by the Persians in the third century. The virtue of Augustus' policy was that It attempted no absolute remedies, but Instead, through constant effort, Intervention and re-adjustment, Roman predominance was maintained west of the Euphrates, the Parthlans were kept off balance, and Augustus avoided a strenuous eastern war which the young empire could ill-afford...|$|R
6000|$|The {{declaration}} of the Irish policy {{of the new government}} was made to parliament by no less a personage than the lord-lieutenant.(130) The prime minister had discoursed on frontiers in Asia and frontiers in Africa, but on Ireland he was silent. Lord Carnarvon, on the contrary, came forward voluntarily with a statement of policy, and he opened it on the broadest general lines. His speech deserves as close attention as any deliverance of this memorable period. It laid down the principles of that alternative system of government, with which the new ministers formally challenged their predecessors. Ought the Crimes Act to be re-enacted as it stood; or in part; or ought it <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>lapse?</b> These were the three courses. Nobody, he thought, would be for the first, because some provisions had never been put in force; others had been put in force but found useless; and others again did nothing that might not be done just as well under the ordinary law. The re-enactment of the whole statute, therefore, was dismissed. But the powers for changing venue at the discretion of the executive; for securing special juries at the same discretion; for holding secret inquiry without an accused person; for dealing summarily with charges of intimidation—might they not be continued? They were not unconstitutional, and they were not opposed to legal instincts. No, all quite true; but then the Lords should not conceal from themselves that their re-enactment would be in the nature of special or exceptional legislation. He had been looking through coercion Acts, he continued, and had been astonished to find that ever since 1847, with some very short intervals hardly worth mentioning, Ireland had lived under exceptional and coercive legislation. What sane man could admit this to be a satisfactory or a wholesome state of things? Why should not they try to extricate themselves from this miserable habit, and aim at some better solution? “Just as I have seen in English colonies across the sea a combination of English, Irish, and Scotch settlers bound together in loyal obedience to the law and the crown, and contributing to the general prosperity of the country, so I cannot conceive that there is any irreconcilable bar here in their native home and in England to the unity and the amity of the two nations.” He went to his task individually with a perfectly free, open, and unprejudiced mind, to hear, to question, and, as far as might be, to understand. “My Lords, I do not believe that with honesty and single-mindedness of purpose on the one side, and with the willingness of the Irish people on the other, it is hopeless to look for some satisfactory solution of this terrible question. My Lords, these I believe to be the opinions and the views of my colleagues.”(131) ...|$|R
