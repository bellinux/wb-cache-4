5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E

5|$|While {{investigating}} the animal control team deaths, Charlie is {{attacked by the}} creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> has bid higher than Elaine {{and will get}} the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The current {{champion}} is Princesa Sugehit, who defeated Zeuxis on February 25, 2017 {{to win the}} championship. It is {{her first}} reign with the title, she is the 20th champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 29th documented champion overall. Martha Villalobos holds {{the record for the}} longest verified individual reign with 1,399 days while Lady Apache's two reigns combine for 1,470 days the longest verified reign of any champion. Due to the undocumented periods prior to 1986 it is possible <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> has actually held the championship longer, but no verification of such a fact has been found. Isabel Romero has held the title three times, the most for any champion, while five women have held the championship twice since it was officially sanctioned in 1986; Lady Apache, La Sirenita, Tiffany, Martha Villalobos and Zuleyma. La Diabólica holds the record for the shortest documented title reign, with 50 days.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1996 at 1:43a.m., Max Cavalera's stepson Dana Wells, {{was killed}} in a car {{accident}} at the age of 21 in Phoenix, Arizona. At the time, Cavalera was the lead vocalist for Sepultura which was on tour promoting its sixth studio album, Roots, in England with Ozzy Osbourne. After hearing the news, Ozzy and his wife Sharon Osbourne hired a private plane to take Cavalera and his wife, manager and mother of Dana, Gloria, back home. After the funeral, Max returned his focus to Sepultura, and the band resumed its European tour. Then, following a sold-out show at London's Brixton Academy on 16 December—later documented on the live album Under a Pale Grey Sky—drummer Igor Cavalera, guitarist Andreas Kisser, and bassist Paulo Jr. told Max they wanted to replace numerous members of the band's staff, including Gloria. Andreas, Paulo and Igor proposed ending the contract with Gloria and hiring a new manager for Sepultura, saying that she paid more attention to Max than the band. The trio suggested that she could continue as Max's personal manager but <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> should manage the band. Gloria refused. Max felt betrayed by his mates, especially his brother.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, {{the results}} of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, {{identifying}} Dawson's modus operandi. Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not rule out the possibility <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time.|$|E

30|$|Alternatively, in 32 % of the {{interviews}} (3, 768 observations) there was <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> present during the interview, mostly {{in the cases of}} individuals younger than 17 years old. There is evidence, at least for face-to-face interviews (see, Aquilino 1993) <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else’s</b> presence during responding to sensitive questions affects the reporting behaviour. Therefore, we created the dummy OTHER_PRESENT which can be arguably assumed to only affect the reporting behaviour. However, the results show that this variable has no effect on the reporting process, making identification of the parameters of the count data models very difficult. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that not only were crime questions self-completed in a computer, but it was also stressed by the interviewers that nobody should disturb the interviewee during the self-completion part.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{application}} of speech modification called "speech morphing". In image processing, morphing {{is a well}} known technique that gradually changes one person's face to <b>that</b> of <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Speech morphing produces similar results for speech; i. e., one person's speechis gradually changed to <b>that</b> of <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Speech morphing {{makes it possible to}} create movies or multi-media entertainment together with image morphing. The proposed algorithm pitch-synchronously modifies fundamental frequency(F 0) and DFT spectrum and outputs high quality speech. To clarify the balance of F 0 modification and spectrum modification, listening tests were carried out using 20 male speakers. The results yielded the relationship between the amount of modification and speaker identity. In terms of overall performance, listening tests show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates smooth, high quality voice changes...|$|R
