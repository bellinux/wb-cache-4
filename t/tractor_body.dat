40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the {{assessment}} of the ride comfort of farm tractors. The problem of assessing the ride comfort is crucial {{due to the fact that}} operators spend part of their own lives on board of such machines, exposed to whole body vibrations potentially harmful for their health. The paper deals with the experimental measurement of the relevant vibration occurring at the <b>tractor</b> <b>body,</b> at the cabin and at the seat. The focus is on which accelerations are actually relevant and have to be taken into account. A number of farm tractors have been instrumented and run under monitored conditions. The test track was equipped with a number of cleats able to force at resonance the cabin and the seat. The six motions of the <b>tractor</b> <b>body</b> and the six motions of the cabin were measured. The motion of the seat was measured. The signals have been processed in the time domain. Some interesting occurrence have been highlighted referring to the amplification that a badly regulated seat can provide under certain circumstances. The comfort index was computed according with ISO 2631 and other standards. The acceleration of the seated subject was described at different positions on the body. It turned out that the acceleration of the head was particularly relevant for establishing a comparison among different tractors. Synthetic indices have been derived from the measured data able to correlate the subjective drivers' feeling with the measured level of vibration. The conclusion is that for a proper comparison of the ride performance of different farm tractors a huge number of measurements are needed. There is no possibility to record only the vertical accelerations to assess the ride co mfort of farm tractors...|$|E

5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and <b>tractor</b> <b>bodies.</b> These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|R

This is particularly true {{in the case of}} tractor drivers who operate tractors in unfavorable conditions and in a high level of seat and tractor vibrations. Therefore, an investigation of vibration sources and finding the methods for decreasing them are of considerable importance. In this research, vibrations that the tractor operators of different weights are exposed to while operating any of the three commonly used tractors in Iran during plowing with moldboard plows, disk harrows or routine road travel at two forward speeds were examined. Acceleration data of <b>tractor</b> <b>body</b> and its driver, while riding the tractor, were measured and recorded. Later, Fast Fourier Analysis, and root mean square of weighted accelerations for the cases of driver health and comfort were analyzed and evaluated.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on both the {{subjective}} and the objective ride comfort evaluation of farm tractors. The experimental measurement of the relevant accelerations occurring at the <b>tractor</b> <b>body,</b> at the cabin and at the seat was performed {{on a number of}} different farm tractors. A subjective rating of the ride comfort level was performed by considering five different drivers. The comfort index was computed according with ISO 2631 and other standards. The acceleration of the seated subject was computed by means of a proper mechanical model of a farm tractor and derived at different positions on the subject body. It turned out that the acceleration of the lower torso was particularly relevant for establishing a matching between the subjective perception and the objective measurement and computation. A number of indices have been derived from the measured data which are able to correlate the subjective driver feeling with the measured accelerations. A proper comparison of the subjective-objective ride performance of a farm tractor requires a huge number of measurements. There is no possibility to record only the vertical acceleration to assess the ride comfort of farm tractors.

40|$|The {{modelling}} {{problems related}} to the simulation {{of the dynamics of}} farm tractors are dealt with. The aim is to develop reliable mathematical models to speed-up the research and development activities in which farm tractors and their sub-systems (driveline, steering and suspension system, etc.) are to be conceived and designed. Two models of farm tractors have been developed. The first model is based on a proprietary software, able to quickly simulate the motion of a vehicle on smooth or rough soil. The second model has been developed by the commercial software ADAMS/Car®, which allows to model complicated transmission and suspension systems. In both of the two models, the tyres, the transmission system, the suspension system, the steering system, the engine and the body inertia are carefully described mathematically. Both of the two models are defined in a parametric way. Particular attention has been devoted to the measurements of the tyre characteristic and of the inertia parameters of the farm <b>tractor</b> <b>body.</b> For the measurement of tyre characteristics, a new instrumented wheel hub has been used. The accurate measurement of both the tyre characteristic and body inertia tensor has allowed a good agreement between measured and computed time histories referring to a number of validation manoeuvres performed either on-road or off-road. The derived farm tractor models could simulate the working conditions of a generic farm tractor while hauling a plough or while running at a relatively high speed on a rough soil or while steering on a sloped, soft surface...|$|E

40|$|Federungssysteme können den Fahrkomfort und das dynamische Verhalten von Traktoren verbessern. Aus diesem Grund werden moderne landwirtschaftliche Traktoren mit verschiedenen Federungssystemen ausgestattet, wie Vorderachs-, Sitz- und Kabinenfederung oder der Federung des Aufbaus. Besonders bei der Vorderachsfederung kommen hauptsächlich passive Regelungssysteme zum Einsatz. Die Hinterachse ist bei Standardtrakoren in der Regel ungefedert. In dieser Untersuchung wurde die Anwendung eines semiaktiven Federungssystems in landwirtschaftlichen Traktoren betrachtet. Hierzu wurde ein Testtraktor mit einem hydropneumatischem Federungssystem für die Hinterachse und einem konventionellen Vorderachsfederungssystem ausgerüstet. Gleichzeitig wurde von dem Traktor ein Simulationsmodell mit dem Programmpaket Matlab-Simulink erstellt. Mit Hilfe von Experimenten wurden Messungen mit der entwickelten semiaktiven und passiven Fahrwerksregelung auf dem hydraulisch angetriebenen Fahrbahnsimulator der TU Berlin durchgeführt und mit den Ergebnissen aus den Simulationsrechnungen verglichen. Hierbei wurde auch das entwickelte Modell verifiziert und validiert. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass die Traktorbeschleunigungen mit dem semiaktiven System um bis zu 13 % verkleinert werden konnten. Die dynamische Reifenkraft konnte um 6 % gegenüber dem passiven System reduziert werden. Generell war festzustellen, dass mit einem semiaktiven System der Fahrkomfort und die Fahrsicherheit entscheidend verbessert werden können. Conventional primary {{agricultural}} tractors have no suspension systems. Since {{the usage}} of suspension systems in tractors improves the ride comfort and dynamic behavior of them, modern agricultural tractors are equipped with different suspension systems such as seat, cabin, or chassis suspension. The technology of the suspension systems for tractors is developing. Recently, some tractor models are presented with the frame construction. These tractors can be equipped with both front and rear axle suspensions. However, {{the efficiency of the}} passive suspensions is limited, and the idea of active systems is considered nowadays with the aim of improving the performance of vehicle’s suspensions. With recent progress in electronic technology, this idea {{is going to be more}} and more practicable. In this investigation, utilization of the active suspension was considered along with development in the suspension technology of agricultural tractors. As the first step, the background of the research was studied that led to select semi-active suspensions as proper systems for agricultural tractors. In addition, as the control strategy of this system, on-off skyhook was selected. In order to evaluate this new system experimentally, a test-tractor was determined. This tractor, called TU-Trac was a full suspension test-tractor with hydro-pneumatic rear suspension. During this research work, the rear axle suspension was equipped with a semi-active control system. In order to evaluate the new suspension system, two approaches of the computer simulation testing and experimental testing were used. For the first one, the computer model of the tractor and suspension system, using MATLAB-Simulink program, was built. For the second approach, the prototype of the new suspension system including a set of the sensors, hydraulic actuators, and electronic controller was developed, and then, they were installed on the tractor suspension. After that, the test design and test plan of the simulation and experimental tests were determined. The suspension system was excited by three sets of impulse inputs, which were applied to the four tractor’s wheels. Each test was performed once on the tractor with passive suspension mode, and then, the same test was performed this time with the semi-active suspension computer model. In the experimental tests, a suspension test rig was used to apply the test inputs to the tractor. This test rig is a part of the facilities at the TU Berlin -Department Machinery System Design. The outputs of the tests were the acceleration data of the <b>tractor</b> <b>body</b> and wheels. These data were analyzed to obtain the time and frequency domain results of them. These results were used in two groups of the body accelerations and dynamic tire forces in order to evaluate the ride comfort and handling ability of the tractor. Using these results, overall computer model was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental one. Then, the comparative results of the passive and semi-active modes of the simulation and experimental tests were used in order to evaluate the performance of the new suspension system. This comparison demonstrated until 13 % reduction on the average of the <b>tractor</b> <b>body</b> accelerations that showed significant improvement in the ride comfort of the tractor. Additionally, the average of the dynamic tire force of the tractor was reduced until 6 % showing that tractor handling was not reduced, but also it was improved significantly. As conclusion, the overall performance of the tractor’s suspension was increased by using the new suspension system...|$|E
40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} {{tasked with}} forecasting freight movements, creating and evaluating policy to mitigate transportation impacts on infrastructure and air quality, and furnishing the data necessary for performance driven investment depend on quality, detailed, and ubiquitous vehicle data. Unfortunately, commercial vehicle data is either missing or expensive to obtain from current resources. To overcome the drawbacks of existing commercial vehicle data collection tools and leverage the already heavy investments into existing sensor systems, {{a novel approach}} of integrating two existing data collection devices to gather high resolution truck data - Weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems and advanced inductive loop detectors (ILD) is developed in this dissertation. Each source provides a unique data set that when combined produces a synergistic data source that is particularly useful for truck body class modeling. Modelling truck body class, rather than axle configuration, provides more detailed depictions of commodity and industry level truck movements. Since body class is closely linked to commodity carried, drive and duty cycle, and other operating characteristics, it is inherently useful {{for each of the}} above mentioned applications. In this work the physical integration including hardware and data collection procedures undertaken to develop a series of truck body class models is presented. Approximately 35, 000 samples consisting of photo, WIM, and ILD signature data were collected and processed representing a significant achievement over previous ILD signature models which were limited to around 1, 500 commercial vehicle records. Three families of models were developed, each depicting an increasing level of input data and output class resolution. The first uses WIM data to estimate body class volumes of five semi-trailer body types and individual predictions of two <b>tractor</b> <b>body</b> classes for vehicles with five axle tractor trailer configurations. The trailer model produces volume errors of less than 10 % while the tractor model resulted in a correct classification rate (CCR) of 92. 7 %. The second model uses ILD signatures to predict 47 vehicle body classes using a multiple classifier system (MCS) approach coupled with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for preprocessing the training data samples. Tests show the model achieved CCR higher than 70 % for 34 of the body classes. The third and most complex model combines WIM and ILD signatures using to produce 63 body class designations, 52 with CCR greater than 70 %. To highlight the contributions of this work, several applications using body class data derived from the third model are presented including a time of day analysis, average payload estimation, and gross vehicle weight distribution estimation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Application of {{agricultural}} machineries such as tractor has been yielded a considerable development in different agricultural activities and productions. However, noticeable health {{problems such as}} noise pollution impact the users of these off-road vehicles. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the noise level induced by agricultural tractors and to evaluate the driver’s noise exposure level.. Material and Method: The sound pressure levels of three brands of tractor include John Deere, Ferguson and Romani were measured by sound level meter model Tes- 1358. The characteristics of place for measuring tractors noise pollution were determined based on the ISO standard No 7216, 5131. The acquired data was analyzed using spss 16 software.. Result: The results showed that the highest and the lowest noise level around the tractors were 83. 8 dB (A) and 73. 9 dB (A) for the John Deere and Romani, respectively. The effect of different transmission gears on the noise level of tractors was not statistically significant Pvalue> 0. 05. While, the effect of the tractor engine speeds on the noise level was statistically significant Pvalue< 0. 01. The exposure time of the most of drivers was frequently about 8 hour or more In this regards, the exposure levels of the tractor’s drivers to noise measured between 85 - 90 dB (A) were higher than the Iranian occupational exposure limit (85 dB (A)). Moreover, mean noise reduction rate of exsisting room which was used upon the typical <b>tractor’s</b> <b>body</b> was 9. 5 dB in one octave band.. Conclusion: Application of standard cockpit and expansion mufflers can effectively reduce noise pollution emission and driver’s occupational exposure. Moreover, regular preventive maintenance and effective hearing conservation program including annual audiometry, hearing protection device, occupational health training for drivers must be implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Long term {{exposure}} of tractor driver to vibrations induced by agricultural machinery operations {{may lead to}} health problems. Therefore it is valuable to obtain the range of frequencies transmitted to tractor driver while performing farm operations, hence in the present study, in order to record <b>tractor</b> driver whole <b>body</b> vibrations, fabrication and evaluation of an inexpensive tractor vibration measuring system was considered. According {{to the results of}} this study, testing the system in static and dynamic conditions approved the system performance. Furthermore, the value of S ed indexes of plowing with moldboard and rotary plows were 0. 35 MPa and 0. 4 MPa respectively. Based on the criterion of USAARL, since these values were lower than 0. 65 MPa, the severity category of operation with the examined plows were graded in the class of 3; which means that the health hazard associated with these operations were marginal. Moreover, dominant frequencies transmitted to driver seat were in the range of 0 - 3 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} mobile robots made of {{a single}} body (car-like robots) or several <b>bodies</b> (<b>tractors</b> towing several trailers sequentially hooked). These robots {{are known to be}} nonholonomic, i. e., they are subject to nonintegrable equality kinematic constraints involving the velocity. In other words, the number of controls (dimension of the admissible velocity space), is smaller than the dimension of the configuration space. In addition, the range of possible controls is usually further constrained by inequality constraints due to mechanical stops in the steering mechanism of the tractor. We first analyze the controllability of such nonholonomic multibody robots. We show that the well-known Controll-ability Rank Condition Theorem is applicable to these robots even when there are inequality constraints on the velocity, in addition to the equality constraints. This allows us to subsume and generalize several controllability results recently published in the Robotics literature concerning nonholonomic mobile robots, and to infer several new important results. We then describe an implemented planner inspired by these results. We give experimental results obtained with this planner that illustrate the theoretical results previously developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this project}} was to instrument the new MnDOT Navistar truck used at MN Road. A rugged data acquisition, data recording and wireless transmission system was established for collection of various sensor signals from the truck. The truck was instrumented with a suite of 20 accelerometers, with these accelerometers being located both on the five axles {{of the truck and}} on the <b>tractor</b> and trailer <b>bodies.</b> In addition, the truck was instrumented with a differential GPS system and an inertial measurement unit in the tractor cab. A cRIO-based data acquisition system, a rugged laptop and Labview software together serve as a flexible platform for data acquisition. A wireless communication system has been established to communicate trigger signals to roadside cabinets when the truck is at desired GPS locations on the road. Data recording by in-pavement sensors is triggered by this system. Software has also been set up for automatic downloading of data from the truck to a server on the network at MN Road. The experimental performance of the developed system has been verified by multiple tests conducted by the research team. The above instrumentation of the truck will enable data collection on truck vibrations, enable analysis of correlations between truck vibrations and variations in signals of weigh-inmotion sensors, and enable recording of truck movements and pavement loads at MnROAD.
