Outside many exterior details were changed from chrome to matte black stainless steel or plastic, such as the wing mirrors, window surrounds and C-pillar ornaments; the B-pillar also received a black finish, the side repeaters changed position and became square, and the front <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> <b>switched</b> from white to amber lenses. In the cabin the seats had more pronounced bolsters and were upholstered in a new camel-coloured fabric.Just one year later, in June 1979, another engine update arrived and the Alfasud Sprint became the Alfasud Sprint Veloce.Thanks to double twin-choke carburetors (each choke feeding a single cylinder) and a higher compression ratio engine output increased to [...] and , respectively for the 1.3 and 1.5.|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} compare reaction times to brake signals when they appear with red or yellow <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> The laboratory study simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject's task was to respond {{as quickly as possible}} to the onset of peripherally presented brake lamps (but not to <b>turn</b> <b>signals),</b> while engaged in a central tracking task. There were three lamp conditions: brake lamps alone, brake lamps while <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> was on, and a turn-signal lamp alone. Thus, the subject's task required an immediate response in the first condition, a delayed response in the second (only after the brake lamps came on, not to the <b>turn</b> <b>signal),</b> and no response in the third condition. <b>Turn</b> <b>signals</b> were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to brake signals were significantly shorter when the brake signals were presented in the context of yellow <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> than when they were presented in the context of red <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> Averaged over both levels of luminous intensity and conditions with and without <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> the difference between yellow and red was 110 ms. The colors of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> had an effect whether or not the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> was on, but the effect was greater when it was. Older subjects were affected more by the color of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> than were younger subjects. In conclusion, yellow <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> are beneficial in situations simulated in this experiment. However, the present findings are directly applicable only to a situation where all vehicles have yellow <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> and tail lamps are not energized...|$|R

40|$|For {{crosstalk}} noise calculation, computing switching windows of a net helps us identify noise sources accurately. Traditional approaches use a single continuous switching window for a net. Under this model, <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is assumed to}} happen any time within the window. Although conservative and sound, this model can result in too much pessimism since in reality the exact timing of <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> is determined by a path delay up to the net, i. e. the underlying circuit structure does not always allow <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> at arbitrary time within the continuous switching window. To address this inherent inaccuracy of the continuous switching window, we propose a refinement of the traditional approaches, where <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is characterized by a}} set of discontinuous switching windows instead of a single continuous window. Each continuous switching window is divided into multiple windows, called time slots, and the <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> activity of each slot is analyzed separately to calculate the maximum noise with more accuracy. By controlling the size of a time slot we can trade off accuracy and runtime, which makes this approach highly scalable. We have confirmed by experiments on industrial circuits that up to 90 % of the noise violations detected by the traditional approach can be unreal. 1...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{visibility}} of a front <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> is decreased if a headlamp is located near the <b>turn</b> <b>signal.</b> Consequently, both the U. S. and ECE regulations require the <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> to be more intense in such situations. However, it is unclear how adjacent light sources affect supratheshold aspects, such as conspicuity. The present field study was designed to examine the effects of several factors on the nighttime conspicuity of front <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> Specifically of interest were the effects of the number, luminous intensity, and spatial arrangement (including spacing) of the masking lamps. The following are the main findings: (1) The conspicuity of a <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> was significantly lower when it was separated from a 1000 -cd low-beam headlamp by 50 mm rather than 100 mm (center-to-edge). A 200 -cd <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> at 100 mm was equal in conspicuity to a 288 -cd <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> at 50 mm. This effect is smaller than the effects obtained in previous studies using threshold-visibility paradigms. (2) Adding a second masking light source, at the same 50 -mm spacing as the first masking light source, significantly influenced the conspicuity of the <b>turn</b> <b>signal.</b> The effect of the second masking source can be compensated for by an increase in the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> intensity corresponding to 8. 5 % of the intensity of the second masking source. (3) The conspicuity of the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> was unaffected by the spatial arrangement of two masking light sources...|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, most front <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> {{worldwide}} emitted white light and most rear <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> emitted red. The auto {{industry in the}} USA voluntarily adopted amber front-turn signals for most vehicles beginning in the 1963 model year, though the advent of amber signals was accompanied by legal stumbles in some states and front <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> were still legally permitted to emit white light until FMVSS 108 took effect for the 1968 model year, whereupon amber became the only permissible front <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> colour. Presently, most countries outside of the United States and Canada require that all front, side and rear <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> produce amber light. Exceptions include Switzerland and New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>signals</b> are {{required}} to blink on and off, or [...] "flash", at a steady rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1â€“2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically.

5000|$|Midway through 1999, the {{taillights}} {{were also}} changed. 1998 and early 1999 models had a separate amber <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> {{along the bottom}} edge of each taillight housing.

Although the lenses changed, the housings did not; they still had the chambers for the separate <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> that early models had. These chambers were now empty, leaving a perfect place to install in police cars strobe tubes that would not affect brake or <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> visibility.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> have {{advantages}} over conventional <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> in terms of their geometric visibility and conspicuity in several important situations. This study was designed to (1) develop methods for evaluating the effects of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> on both the frequency and severity of relevant crashes, and (2) provide an illustrative application of these approaches. We presented arguments suggesting that a viable approach involves a longitudinal comparison of the crash experience of vehicle models that had an abrupt year-to-year change from 0 % to 100 % installation. Several crash scenarios were identified that might be sensitive to the presence of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> including changing lanes, merging, making turns, and leaving a parked position. We identified 13 vehicle models in the U. S. that had the desirable abrupt change in the installation of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> An illustrative analysis was then performed on the crash experience of these 13 vehicle models using the North Carolina crash database. The results indicate a tendency for vehicles with mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> to be less likely involved in turn-signal-related crashes, but the effect was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the results were inconclusive concerning the possibility of a reduction in crash severity for vehicles with mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> As manufacturers adopt mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> on more vehicle models, the target population of vehicles for a crash analysis will increase. At that point, the approach illustrated in this report could be used to perform a more definitive analysis of the safety benefits of mirrormounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

International proponents of amber rear signals say they are more easily discernible as <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> and U.S. studies in the early 1990s demonstrated improvements in the speed and accuracy of following drivers' reaction to stop lamps when the <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> were amber rather than red.|$|R

This allows permissive turning even when straight through traffic is shown a red light, avoiding yellow trap.
