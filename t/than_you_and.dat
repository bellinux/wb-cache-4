She likely meant to dedicate the book to Stephanie, writing in the manuscript, [...] "Now Stephanie, {{this is a story}} about a little girl called Lucie; she was smaller <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> could not speak quite plain.". In the end however, the book was dedicated to Lucie Carr. Stephanie would receive the dedication to The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher in 1906.|$|E
500|$|Khurshid Pasha {{dispatched}} Emir Yusuf Ali Murad, a Maronite sheikh {{from the}} Abu'l Lama family, {{to rein in}} peasant rebels in Jubail, but Shahin sent a letter warning Emir Yusuf not to [...] "intervene in the affairs" [...] of Jubail because the [...] "Christians of Jubail were united with the ahali of Keserwan" [...] and claimed that [...] "all the Christians of Syria have made common cause". He condemned Emir Yusuf for aligning himself with the ousted sheikhs and his [...] "Druze relatives" [...] and accused him of attempting to [...] "subjugate the Christians after we achieved our [...] ". He threatened Emir Yusuf to [...] "return without delay" [...] and that if he [...] "desires a fight, we are more eager <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> we are not afraid". Shahin's confidence in the support he received from the Christian peasantry of Keserwan {{and other parts of}} Mount Lebanon and his challenge to Emir Yusuf through a populist sectarian approach alarmed the Maronite elites, the church and the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
500|$|Chris Williams of Billboard said [...] "with a vocal assist from Ne-Yo and {{a clever}} guest rap by Kanye West, it appears Hilson {{is intent on}} a {{knockout}} punch of her own." [...] Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song {{was one of the}} better radio-friendly tracks on the album. Melinda Newman of HitFix said that [...] "the mid-tempo track is undeniably catchy and will embed itself within your brain after only a few listens." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music positively received the song, calling it the album's [...] "biggest potential hit." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, complimenting production by Danja, and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than [...] "Return the Favor", he complained that [...] "getting two R A-listers to appear on your track should be a real coup, but not when one's got a more distinctive voice <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the other steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook, stating [...] "Hook-wise, it’s a little like listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double-dutch." [...] He also said that Hilson's vocals [...] "show promise but fail to distinguish the Hilson brand from the crowd." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{complexity}} of many of Boito's proposed ideas, along with his alternative scenarios, which are expressed in a long letter to Verdi (most of which the composer regarded as excessive), the Council Chamber scene emerged as the focus of the new collaboration. Although he had confidence in the young librettist's abilities (" [...] written by you could not possibly be dull"), Verdi did caution Boito that he appeared to be [...] "aiming at a perfection impossible here. [...] I [...] aim lower and am more optimistic <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I don't despair", in essence, expressing an unwillingness to re-write the opera as completely as Boito had proposed. It would have been far more work than the composer wished to be involved in at the time.|$|E
