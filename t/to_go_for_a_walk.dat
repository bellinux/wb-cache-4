25|$|The novel then flashes back {{to before}} the explosion, taking the {{perspective}} of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Mrs. Verloc's mother informs the family that she intends {{to move out of}} the house. Mrs. Verloc's mother and Stevie use a hansom which is driven by a man with a hook in the place of his hand. The journey greatly upsets Stevie, as the driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs. Verloc must calm him down. On Verloc's return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with Stevie. After this walk, Mrs. Verloc notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc then tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.|$|E

2500|$|Abbey's {{literary}} influences included Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Peter Kropotkin, and A. B. Guthrie, Jr.. Although often {{compared to}} authors like Thoreau or Aldo Leopold, Abbey {{did not wish}} to be known as a nature writer, saying that he didn't understand [...] "why so many want to read about the world out-of-doors, when it's more interesting simply <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> into the heart of it." [...] The theme that most interested Abbey was that of the struggle for personal liberty against the totalitarian techno-industrial state, with wilderness being the backdrop in which this struggle took place. Most of Abbey's writing criticizes the park services and American society for its reliance on motor vehicles and technology. He wanted to preserve the wilderness as a refuge for humans and believed that modernization was making us forget what was truly important in life.|$|E
2500|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.|$|E

6000|$|The embroidery, {{which was}} a matter for thought, the design being {{difficult}} and the colours wanting consideration, brought lapses into the dialogue when {{she seemed to be}} engrossed in her skeins of silk, or, with head a little drawn back and eyes narrowed, considered the effect of the whole.
