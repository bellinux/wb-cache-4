The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered {{by the time of the}} robbery.|$|E
5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a serious incident with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring. While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Harrison, Scott and Mitchell soon {{developed}} a mutual rapport, according to L.A. Express bassist Max Bennett. In addition to carrying out further sessions for Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles, in March 1974, Harrison had begun spending time there <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> {{up his own}} record label, with the winding down of the Beatles' Apple Records from mid 1973 onwards. In August 1973, rumours {{in the music industry}} claimed that Harrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Paul Simon were forming a label together; in fact, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records, one of the first releases of which was the Shankar album, and Dylan temporarily signed with David Geffen's Asylum Records, which was Mitchell's label.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland {{abandoned}} its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> this peg on 6 October. By 9 October, the Icelandic króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME's takeover of the last major Icelandic bank, and thus the loss of all króna trade 'clearing houses'. The next day, the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European Central Bank quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.|$|E

The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore {{mentions}} this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter.

5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies seem to indicate that there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when {{a number of the}} safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's fingerprints on them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> her up and that Paul helped her deal with the situation, and that she did not tell Mark to protect him.

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt.

Descartes is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E
