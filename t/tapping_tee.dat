40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of adhesively bonded MDPE joints were studied. The lap-shear joints were prepared using PE 80 polyethylene gas pipe and four adhesive types; two acrylic and two epoxy resins. The key {{mechanical properties}} of {{lap shear strength}} and impact resistance were investigated {{as a function of}} adhesive type and surface preparation technique. Mechanical abrasion of the PE 80 surface increased the strength of the bonds from 40 to 460 % for the four adhesives, with the best performing acrylic adhesive having a lap-shear strength of 1. 76 MPa and impact strength of 2. 5 kJ/m 2. When used to bond PE 80 tapping tees to PE 80 gas pipe, the acrylic adhesive produced a gas tight seal at both the standard test pressure of 0. 4 MPa and at an increased pressure of 0. 8 MPa, and outperformed the PE 80 <b>tapping</b> <b>tee</b> during shear testing and withstood a maximum of 10 cycles of 175 J during impact testing. These results highlight the potential of adhesive bonding as a method of joining PE 80 tapping tees to PE 80 gas pipe...|$|E
40|$|Nemo Engineering AS (Nemo) {{has built}} a series of Tees for welding into {{offshore}} pipelines for transportation of hydrocarbons. The purpose with the Tees is to allow connection of new pipelines from existing or future oil and gas fields. This is often a cost-effective solution which minimises the need for construction of new pipelines. Some of the Tees are designed with open tee branch which is isolated with a ball valve system. Another solution is to design a Tee where the branch is blinded off by a solid steel barrier plate. This is a socalled Hot <b>Tap</b> <b>Tee</b> (HTT). At the time when a new pipeline is {{to be connected to}} the HTT, the steel barrier plate is drilled open by a core drill operation. This operation is performed when the pipeline is at full flow and operational pressure. The core drill operation is complex and requires a large amount of subsea tooling equipment. In addition, the operation is time consuming and involves elements of risk in case of failing equipment. Nemo Engineering as is currently working on the Ormen Lange project where two HTTs at 850 m water depth will be opened by core drilling in 2009 for connection of pipelines from a new gas field (Ormen Lange Southern Field). During this project, equipment for blinding/sealing of the opened HTTâ€™s has been developed. This is an Isolation Plug (IP), which is used to seal off the open HTT. The purpose with the IP is to use it in case of future disassembly of the connected pipeline and isolation ball valve without compromising the integrity and operational service condition for the HTT-pipeline. Nemo Engineering as has initiated a development project of a new HTT design where the steel barrier plate is changed out with a combination of using the IP and a steel membrane seal in the tee branch. The membrane will function as a substitution for the thick steel barrier plate and function as a metallic seal until the IP is removed. The idea is that the steel membrane will break when the IP is removed, and the core drilling operation is no longer necessary. This Thesis contains the work related to preliminary design, modelling, analysis and testing of a steel membrane prototype. The main conclusion from the work is that there is good correlation between the results from the finite element analysis and the observed test loads...|$|R
