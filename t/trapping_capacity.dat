50|$|Cirrus cloud {{thinning}} is {{a proposed}} form of climate engineering. Cirrus clouds are high cold ice that, like other clouds, both reflect sunlight and absorb warming infrared radiation. However, they differ from {{other types of}} clouds in that, on average, infrared absorption outweighs sunlight reflection, resulting in a net warming effect on the climate. Therefore, thinning or removing these clouds would reduce their heat <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity,</b> resulting in a cooling effect on Earth's climate. This could be a potential tool to reduce anthropogenic global warming. Cirrus cloud thinning is an alternative category of climate engineering, in addition to solar radiation management and greenhouse gas removal.|$|E
50|$|In principle, the {{electromagnetic}} field mainly {{depends on the}} shape of the mass analyzers. As a result, a smaller magnet fitting with small size MS reduces the system weight significantly. In practice, when reducing the size, the geometries of mass analyzer are distorted. For example, smaller volume in ion trap leads to lower <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> and therefore results in a loss of resolution and sensitivity. However, by operating tandem MS which is capable to give the structural information of the sample from a complex mixture, resolution and selectivity are greatly enhanced. In general, beam-type mass analyzers, such as TOF and sector mass analyzers, are much larger than ion trap type such as Paul trap, Penning trap or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Additionally, ion trap mass analyzers can be used to perform multistage MS/MS in a single device. As a result, ion traps are received dominant attention for building a MMS.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe mineral <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{considered}} the most secure long-term CO 2 storage mechanism as it permanently demobilizes injected carbon. Here we compare three different reservoir rock mineral compositions {{in terms of their}} mineral <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> using a mass balance approach. The evolution of carbon fractions in the form of residual CO 2, CO 2 in the formation water and carbon stored in minerals is predicted over time using reaction path modelling. The two studied siliciclastic reservoirs (Precipice Sandstone, Surat Basin, Australia; Pretty Hill Formation, Otway Basin Australia) have no or only a very small mineral <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity,</b> whereas the volcanoclastic reservoir (Takinoue Formation, central Hokkaido, Japan) has a very large mineral <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> This difference results from the abundance of reactive Ca-, Mg- and Fe-bearing silicate minerals.

However, relatively {{little is known about the}} <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of mangrove above-ground roots and seagrass plants for leaf segments. We aimed to identify the major factors controlling the leaf-trapping capacity of mangroves and seagrasses in a flume study. For mangroves, we found that higher density mangrove roots enhanced <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> whereas the presence of waves strongly reduced the <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> The latter might be explained by a reduced average collision time (i. e. the time a leaf was attached to a root structure) in the presence of waves. The ability for seagrass beds to trap leaves was dominated by the length/type of vegetation and the absence/presence of waves. Overall, our results suggest that mangroves-via their roots-have a more efficient trapping mechanism than seagrass beds. Mangrove roots extend through the entire water column the majority of the time, which enhances <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> In contrast, seagrass beds require particulate organic material to become entangled within the predominantly submerged shoots, making trapping dependent on the degraded state of the leaf and the water depth. Our results give an indication of parameters which could be used in a model of <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of these ecosystems. As leaves are associated with nutrients, we have identified factors which will help to determine what parameters affect the nutrient retention or export of ecosystems.

40|$|We {{investigate}} two-dimensional liquid bridges trapped between {{pairs of}} identical horizontal cylinders. The cylinders support forces due to surface tension and hydrostatic pressure which balance {{the weight of}} the liquid. The shape of the liquid bridge is determined by analytically solving the nonlinear Laplace-Young equation. Parameters that maximize the <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> (defined as the cross-sectional area of the liquid bridge) are then determined. The results show that these parameters can be approximated with simple relationships when the radius of the cylinders is small compared to the capillary length. For such small cylinders, liquid bridges with the largest cross sectional area occur when the centre-to-centre distance between the cylinders is approximately twice the capillary length. The maximum <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> for a pair of cylinders at a given separation is linearly related to the separation when it is small compared to the capillary length. The meniscus slope angle of the largest liquid bridge produced in this regime is also a linear function of the separation. We additionally derive approximate solutions for the profile of a liquid bridge making use of the linearized Laplace-Young equation. These solutions analytically verify the above relationships obtained for the maximization of the <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical & Engineering Science...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{toxicity}} and {{occurrence in}} the environment lead to the research of easy to handle and cheap water treatment process. Zero Valent Iron (ZVI) supports meet these requirements. ZVI <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> is due to iron by-products, such as green rusts, lepidocrocite [...] . According to physico-chemical conditions applied, the nature of by-products changes and arsenic <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> is highly impacted. The aim of this work concerns the influence of aeration onto arsenic trapping in ZVI/sand columns. Four up-flow reactors filled with a ZVI/sand mixture were fed with synthetic water spiked with AsV. Two columns were aerated by air diffusers placed at the bottom while the two others were not aerated. Arsenic concentrations were monitored for three months in order to characterize arsenic sorption capacity of both configurations. A nearly complete removal was observed during the first five days into aerated system, whereas arsenic removal was stable, close to 50 % during the first 20 days for the non aerated units. After this period an inversion of arsenic <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> was observed, the non-aerated columns showed a higher arsenic removal than the aerated ones. Finally, when all columns reach their saturation, highest As trapping capacities were obtained in the non-aerated systems. According to arsenic monitoring, these retention capacities were estimated at 220 and 140 mg(As) /g(Fe) for non-aerated and aerated columns respectively. Solid support samples were collected along the reactor and four different layers were distinguished. After acid mineralization, analysis of total arsenic highlighted different repartitions inside the reactors: a homogeneous concentration in the non-aerated systems and a decreasing concentration form inlet to outlet for the aerated pilot units. In order to characterize As sorption into ZVI/sand columns, breakthrough curves were modelized using Thomas model. The determined KTh constants were different for aerated and non-aerated columns, which confirmed that the affinity of arsenic for solid support was different in the two systems. Oxygen measurement showed that synthetic water was close to saturation for aerated systems while it increased from 0. 5 to 8 within 70 days in the non-aerated units. According to iron corrosion mechanisms, aeration induced a fast ZVI iron by-products generation, and thus a higher arsenic <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> {{at the beginning of}} the experiment. Arsenic sorption into non-aerated reactors was lower but lasted longer, due to the regular ZVI-by-products generation. The lower <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of aerated systems could be due to a conversion over time of the early-created byproducts to less reactive forms...|$|E

It is clear that typically inappropriate cleaning methods were used which resulted in artificially high contact angle measurements.

The reactor is sensitive and inexpensive and can be operated by nonprofessional technicians. A positive relationship {{between the number of}} trapped M 2 + with the DALF reactor and its concentration in the flowing seawater was observed. Both the pH in the medium and the phosphate content within the ferritin cavity strongly affected <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> It was found that the ferritin released its phosphate compound directly with a shift in pH without the need for releasing reagent, which differs from the phosphate release characteristics of horse spleen ferritin, as previously described.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between germinal centre formation and the follicular trapping of immune complexes in the rat spleen was investigated. Lethally (9 Gy) X-irradiated rats were reconstituted with thoracic duct lymphocytes and subsequently challenged with sheep red blood cells to induce germinal centre formation. Rats were killed at daily intervals from 1 to 8 days after reconstitution and antigenic stimulation. Antigen <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> during this interval was assessed by intravenous injection of HRP-anti-HRP immune complexes, 24 hr before killing of the animals. Germinal centre formation could be observed from Day 4 onwards. The follicular <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity,</b> which had been abolished by the X-irradiation, however, returned 2 days later (i. e. by Day 6). Apparently, in these experiments, early germinal centre formation could occur without an intact follicular trapping mechanism. It was, therefore, concluded that in this transfer system follicular immune complex trapping is not a prerequisite for the induction of de novo germinal centre formation. Previous {{studies have shown that}} both follicular dendritic cells and marginal zone B cells {{may play a role in}} the follicular antigen trapping mechanism. FDCs, as detectable with mAB MRC OX 2 in immunoperoxidase-stained frozen sections, were present in spleens at any time after irradiation and reconstitution; the impaired follicular trapping of HRP-anti-HRP immune complexes was therefore not due to an absence of FDCs. Marginal zone B cells, however, were almost absent until 5 days after reconstitution, as observed by immunohistochemical staining with anti-B cell mABs (HIS 14 and HIS 22) and a polyclonal anti-IgD antiserum.

40|$|Intertidal {{mangrove}} forests {{exist in}} a dynamic coastal environment that is increasingly impacted by human interference, leading to habitat fragmentation, reduced habitat quality and changing hydrodynamic and geomorphological conditions. Biophysical feedback mechanisms are essential to maintain mangrove ecosystems under such changing conditions, for example by facilitating sediment deposition during periods of tidal flooding to allow for long-term coastal accretion. However, human interferences affect these biophysical interactions. This study investigated the consequences of two widespread anthropogenic intervention scenarios on biophysical interactions in mangroves: sediment starvation (reduced sediment supply) and coastal squeeze (limited landward accommodation space). Field observations of hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics were conducted in Mandai mangrove fringing the sheltered northern shore of Singapore. A process-based numerical model (Delft 3 D) of this field site was set-up, providing accurate approximations of the observed flow velocities and deposition rates. This model was used for a scenario analysis of the initial response of the sediment <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> in the mangrove system to instantaneous changes related to anthropogenic interventions. This analysis showed increased deposition rates in major parts of the mangrove when sediment supplies increased (up to three times more deposition after 1 tide) or when the landward accommodation space of the mangrove was extended (+ 17 % deposition). A comparison of the outcomes of these scenarios with {{the current state of}} the mangrove underlined a lack of short-term sediment <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity,</b> affecting the (longer-term) adaptive capacity of the system. Thus, at present Mandai mangrove is potentially affected by reduced sediment supply and limited landward accommodation space. Importantly, actions to reduce this anthropogenic influence could enhance mangroves' sediment <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity,</b> facilitating increased resilience to future projected changes such as sea-level rise. Understanding this influence of anthropogenic interventions on mangrove resilience is essential if we are aiming to maintain coastal ecosystem stability, especially along rapidly changing and urbanizing tropical shorelines...|$|E

The sheared zone associated with large faults can form traps. Sheared zones associated with small faults can compartmentalize reservoirs leading to unreliable estimates of reserves. Measured values of capillary pressure were compared with estimated capillary pressure values from four correlation methods. Based on comparison of estimated pressure with measured pressure, Pittman's method gave the most reliable results for predicting capillary pressure and therefore the height of the oil column. However, all methods for predicting capillary pressure worked well for samples with porosities above 20 % and permeabilities above 100 md. Hydrocarbon column heights were then determined from the capillary pressure values. The large sheared zone of the Cities Service Dincans 1 (CD 1) well, Toro Grande field, Jackson County, has a predicted <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of up to 1, 961 ft of oil at 10, 000 ft depth and 35 % saturation of oil.

Microphases, such as non metallic inclusions (NMI) and martensite-austenitecarbide constituent (MAC), were studied in some detail due to their hydrogen <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> Fractographic studies of hydrogen charged tensile samples were carried out to study the effect of microstructure and hydrogen content on the fracture micromechanisms. A critical hydrogen content (Ck) was estimated for each weld metal. The <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> 'of each weld metal was studied using an electrochemical double pulse technique to measure the hydrogen trapping constant (k). The weld metals were classified based on composition, microstructure and micro-phase characteristics. NMI number density, size and spatial distribution were determined and thermodynamic calculations were proposed to identify their type. MAC morphology and distribution were qualitatively assessed. Retention of austenite was estimated, considering chemical and size stabilisation of remaining austenite. It was found that a continuous network of grain boundary ferrite (PF(G)), in combination with the presence of retained austenite in the MAC particle and certain NMI characteristics were beneficial to increase Ck. In weld metals without PF(G), retained austenite proportion and NMI distribution and size {{play a critical role in}} maintaining tolerance to hydrogen.

The simulation models accurately reproduce the dependence of γ on pressure below the CO 2 saturation pressure at 300 K, and over predict γ by ~ 20 % at higher pressures. In addition, in agreement with experimental observations, the simulations predict that γ increases slightly with temperature or salinity. We also demonstrate that for non-hydroxylated quartz surfaces, θ strongly increases with pressure at subcritical and supercritical conditions. An increase in temperature significantly reduces the contact angle, especially at low-intermediate pressures (1 – 10 MPa), this effect is mitigated at higher pressures, 20 MPa.

The enzyme has developed a unique strategy to combine a broad substrate specificity with a high detoxification efficacy, by immediately trapping the reactive compounds as covalent intermediates and by being expressed at high levels for high <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> Computer simulation and experimental data as well as existing epidemiologic studies reveal this detoxification strategy as the mechanistic basis for a threshold in the tumorigenesis of mutagenic carcinogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between various antioxidants {{may be important}} in protecting the newborn baby against oxygen toxicity. We studied the total radical <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of the antioxidants in plasma (TRAP) and compared the TRAP level in the preterm and term baby (cord blood) with that in adults. In addition, the concentrations of various known antioxidants were measured and the theoretical contribution of these antioxidants to the TRAP calculated. The measured and calculated TRAP {{were higher in the}} newborn babies than the adults. The uric acid concentration was similar in the three groups but the vitamin C concentration was higher and the vitamin E and sulfhydryl concentrations were lower in the newborn babies. In contrast to the adult group, the measured TRAP in the newborn babies did not correlate with the calculated TRAP. This may be due to differences in inhibition or recycling of antioxidants in the newborn and adult groups. Theoretical considerations showed {{that there may be a}} large unidentified group of antioxidants that contribute to measured TRAP in plasma. Bilirubin and beta-carotene were measured (higher and lower concentrations, respectively, in the newborn) in an attempt to identify these antioxidants. The efficient plasma radical <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> in the cord blood may partly compensate for deficiencies in other components of the antioxidant defenses, e. g. cellular enzymes, at the time of birt...|$|E
40|$|Carbonyl {{stress and}} {{accumulation}} of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in human tissues {{are involved in}} diabetic complications, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and aging. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in vitro protective effect of aqueous extracts of coffee silverskin (CS) in the formation of AGEs and trapping of carbonyl reactive species such as methylglyoxal (MGO). Aqueous extracts of CS from Arabica and Robusta coffee varieties were obtained under environment friendly extraction conditions. CS extracts were characterized by the analysis of dietary fiber, caffeine, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), total phenolic compounds, browning, melanoidins, and antioxidant capacity. CS extracts and CGA exhibited a dose-dependent anti-AGE capacity in the protein–glucose model system (37 °C/ 21 days) with an IC 50 of 0. 6 mg/mL and 0. 4 mg/mL, respectively. Caffeine did not prevent AGE formation under the studied conditions. Regardless to protein–MGO assay (37 °C/ 14 days), the anti-AGE capacity of CS extracts and CGA was also dose-dependent with an IC 50 of 1. 3 mg/mL and 0. 1 mg/mL, respectively. Caffeine weakly inhibited the reaction of protein and MGO. The MGO <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> was established as a model for protection against carbonyl stress. Robusta CS was very effective for the direct trapping of MGO with an IC 50 of 0. 055 mg/mL as compared with Arabica CS (IC 50 of 0. 6 mg/mL). CGA and caffeine showed an IC 50 for MGO <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity</b> of 0. 14 mg/mL and > 10 mg/mL, respectively. The highest CGA content in the Robusta CS extract could explain its higher MGO trapping activity as compared with the Arabica CS extract. The anti-AGE and MGO trapping capacities of CS may be associated to other chemical components besides CGA. In conclusion, aqueous CS extract may be considered as a natural source of inhibitors of in vitro formation of AGEs and carbonyl stress. The inhibitory effect of the coffee extracts may be associated to their carbonyl <b>trapping</b> <b>capacity.</b> This research is funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (Spain) under project NATURAGE (AGL 2010 - 17779) and CSIC- 201370 E 027.

30|$|The binder is an {{important}} ingredient in Li-S battery, it functions to bond and keep the active materials in the electrode, to ensure well electrical contact between the active materials and conductive carbon, {{as well as to}} link the active materials with the current collector [24 – 28]. In particular, the recent investigations on silicon anodes have revealed that ideal binder should not only able to adhesion strength and ductility with inexhaustible tolerance of large volume change and still physically and/or chemically <b>trap</b> <b>capacity</b> to attain high initial reversible capacity and excellent cycle ability. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is widely used as a conventional binder for Li-S batteries [28]. However, due to the linear-molecular structure, PVDF just play a role of physical adhesion, enabling the mechanical linkage of the active materials with additives, the function will fade with time when there is no bonding between those polymers and the carbon substrate, resulting in the vexed problem that polysulfide dissolved in the aprotic electrolyte. Therefore, new functional binder is the urgent needs {{to make up for the}} deficiencies of PVDF. Thus it can be seen crosslink structured binder for further improvement in the cycle life is constructed with the increased number of active sites between polysulfides and binder. Recent investigations shown that functional materials endued with amine groups have been viewed as an ideal hunter to absorb polar lithium sulfides and nonpolar carbon surface, which effectively prevents loss of active mass during cycles [29, 30].|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{two-phase}} flow characterization (CO 2 /water) of a Triassic sandstone core from the Paris Basin, France, is {{reported in this}} paper. Absolute properties (porosity and water permeability), capillary pressure, relative permeability with hysteresis between drainage and imbibition, and residual <b>trapping</b> <b>capacities</b> have been assessed at 9 MPa pore pressure and 28 °C (CO 2 in liquid state) using a single core-flooding apparatus associated with magnetic resonance imaging. Different methodologies have been followed to obtain a data set of flow properties to be upscaled and used in large-scale CO 2 geological storage evolution modeling tools. The measurements {{are consistent with the}} properties of well-sorted water-wet porous systems. As the mineralogical investigations showed a nonnegligible proportion of carbonates in the core, the experimental protocol was designed to observe potential impacts on flow properties of mineralogical changes. The magnetic resonance scanning and mineralogical observations indicate mineral dissolution during the experimental campaign, and the core-flooding results show an increase in porosity and water absolute permeability. The changes in {{two-phase flow}} properties appear coherent with the pore structure modifications induced by the carbonates dissolution but the changes in relative permeability could also be explained by a potential increase of the water-wet character of the core. Further investigations on the impacts of mineral changes are required with other reactive formation rocks, especially carbonate-rich ones, because the implications can be significant both for the validity of laboratory measurements and for the outcomes of in situ operations modeling...|$|R
