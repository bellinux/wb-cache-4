The Scarecrow adds that he is a humbug, in which the Wizard gladly says that is he is exactly that. The Wizard made promises he could not keep, as did many 19th-century politicians. The Wizard later states: [...] "How can I help being a humbug… when all these people make me do things that everyone knows can't be done," [...] showing {{that he was able to}} deceive others because others were willing to be deceived.|$|E

[...] Instead of the game being patched to correct issues, most game-wide variables are controlled on the server level, allowing Uber Entertainment to make tweaks to things such as character speed, weapon damage, match length and game difficulty. This allows for fine tuning without the need to download an additional patch for the game. Monday Night Combat dynamic update system is hosted on Microsoft's Title Managed Storage. Title Managed Storage is an allocated space on Xbox Live servers for developers to use. Uber Entertainment placed a text document on the server which stores any values <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to adjust dynamically.

5000|$|After {{the common}} {{assembly}} was ended on Friday, and {{in line with}} the Friday discussions, a special meeting was held on Saturday 10 February concerning schooling.. Sanna Jonassen from Fosen/Namsos had initiated this meeting. The discussion concluded with a resolution that was attached to the minutes of the assembly. It was demanded that [...] "the State should be obliged to provide Sami education while retaining the Sami language in the schools, with Sami overseers and teaching of such subjects, which are necessary for the Sami to know if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to exist as reindeer farmers". The resolution points out that this should be arranged in different ways in Southern Sami and Northern Sami regions, given that in Southern Sami areas, the Sami kept on settling down there.It was also felt that it was the State, and not the Sami missionary organisation, that should have responsibility for education.|$|E
5000|$|The {{demand for}} halal products, which is {{increasing}} by an estimated 10% per year, {{has captured the}} attention of food distributors, growers, companies, and the like. Sales of halal products totaled 4 billion euros in 2009 and Solis (a consultancy that specializes in marketing to ethnic minorities) forecasts the market will expand about 10% in 2010, compared with a 2% growth in overall food sales. Antoine Bonnel, director of the 2010 Paris Halal trade show said, “It’s mostly driven by the second and third generations. It’s not a case of the Muslim community withdrawing into itself, but rather one of integration, since <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to buy halal sauerkraut or spring rolls”. French sales of halal food are forecast to hit 5.5 billion euros for 2010 and according to Bonnel, move “from the ethnic market to the mass market” due to the beurgeois, who are forcing international food suppliers to cater for their demands and as one French website put it, halal is [...] "very good business" [...] for French companies.|$|E

50|$|The {{first issue}} of the {{magazine}} was published on 25 November 1924 with the following statement of intent:Forty-five years ago a small company planted The Bulletin, and its growth has been so remarkable that to-day the paper is known and read not only {{in all parts of}} Australia, but in every English-speaking country. There are, however, interests which The Bulletin has never been able to serve; and {{the most important of these}} relate to women. The Woman's Mirror proposes to serve those needs; and it will have behind it the organisation which The Bulletin has built up.Hitherto it has not been possible for The Bulletin to make use of that large amount of purely feminine writing which it has been offered. Much of it has been fiction, of first-rate quality. The Mirror will present to Australian women the best of this work, along with the work of men who appeal particularly to women readers. Through serials and short stories Australian women writers and Australian women readers will for the first time be brought together; and it is appropriate that the first serial will be one of great interest by Ethel Turner, the best-known of all Australian women novelists. It will be generally admitted that no paper has done so much for Australian literature as The Bulletin; and the readers of The Mirror will benefit by the close contact which The Bulletin has established with every Australian writer of repute.The story section will, however, be only one of many with which The Mirror will appeal to Australian women. Every feminine interest and activity will be served in the best way that long experience can suggest and money can command. Specialists will help the paper's readers in their dress designing and building; others will help them in the thousand and one matters that perplex the housewife; doctors and nurses will give advice, especially to bush-mothers, with regard to ailments and the sickroom; even the lawyer will be brought into the service to make plain some of the problems that disturb women.But the woman and the girl of to-day ask for more even than all this. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to talk entertainingly. The Mirror will set itself out to supply the material. It will tell them a little about books and the people who write them; it will tell them something about plays and players; about pictures and those who make them; about games and the people who are famous in them; about music and musicians. It will have its contributors in London, in Paris, in New York. It will give the country girl an opportunity to tell the city girl the interesting things of the town.The field is astonishingly large and attractive; and The Mirror believes that it can cover it all without ever printing a dull page.|$|E
5000|$|To Oastler 'Tory-Radical' {{was not a}} {{description}} of a political philosophy (and certainly not of his) but of a tactical alliance of the supporters of two different philosophies against the Whigs. He was a 'Church and King' Tory but, as the Duke of Wellington noted, a strange one. He denied any element of Radicalism in his political philosophy, and regarded himself as an 'ultra-Tory' rather than a Peelite 'Conservative'; he thought Peel too readily accepted (and adopted) the Whig application of the modern doctrines of 'political economy' to the country's problems. He held that God knew better than Malthus: nothing could supersede Biblical injunctions that the poor should not be oppressed and the distressed should be succoured. Market forces were not a 'hidden hand' working for some greater good, nor was interference with them imprudent folly. On the contrary I believe that man is a fallen, selfish, ignorant being, and that every unregulated and unrestrained action of his is fraught with evil - that, if left without the restraining and regulating laws of God (which, by our Constitution, must be {{part and parcel of the}} laws of the land), instead of preferring such schemes, in the search of his own advantage, as would be advantageous to the society, his selfishness would lead him to injure all for his own benefit. I learn this from the Holy Bible. I have often witnessed it. Reform on a Whig laissez-faire agenda had worsened the condition of the poor and led to chronic discontent, to which the response was greater centralisation and greater coercion; this was a vicious circle which could only end badly. He had seen the 'poor deluded famished Luddites' and thought them to be pitied rather than feared - only because they were famished had they allowed themselves to be deluded. English working people loved peace, order and their old local habits; they disliked change and confusion The great mistake in the minds of those raised above the working class is, that they think the people want plunder and anarchy. I know they want no such thing - they want peace and rest - and their rights. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to go out in a morning, get a good day's work done, and come home with a fair remuneration... If the working men of England were dealt with according to the Bible rather than 'political economy' their economic woes would disappear. With those woes gone support for Reform, Radicalism, trades unionism etc. would evaporate. There would then be no need for a centralised coercive state apparatus: instead the throne (and the rest of the constitution) would rest on the securest foundation - the love of the people. To Oastler, therefore, rich Whigs were a greater danger to the status quo than were working-class Radicals. Until the 1840s, very few Tories would have agreed with him: events such as the Bristol riots of 1831 seeming to provide evidence that coercion was essential. Working class radicals were initially dubious about allying themselves with an opponent of their constitutional aspirations, but eventually came to value Oastler more highly than many of their ostensible allies; a co-belligerent [...] "above purchase and above suspicion" [...] on bread-and-butter issues: the portrait of Oastler reproduced in this article was given away by the Chartist Northern Star in its series of prints of 'Portraits of Patriots' ...|$|E
