5|$|In 2010, Bonds's son Nikolai, {{who served}} as a Giants batboy during his father's years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad in <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> during games, was charged with five misdemeanors {{resulting}} from a confrontation with his mother, Sun. Barry accompanied him to San Mateo County Superior Court.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind <b>the</b> <b>dugout.</b> Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the stadium's seating was {{expanded}} with 150 chairback seats and 1,050 bleacher seats. <b>The</b> <b>dugouts,</b> playing surface, and fences were also renovated. In 2005, a new LED scoreboard was installed. In 2007, the players' clubhouse, {{which includes a}} lounge, lockers, and offices, was redesigned. 2011 renovations saw adjustments to <b>the</b> <b>dugouts,</b> clubhouse, batting cages, windscreen, and outfield fence.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>dugout</b> {{refers to}} <b>the</b> area being {{slightly}} depressed below field level, as {{is common in}} professional baseball. The prevailing theory {{of the origin of}} locating <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> below field level is that it allowed spectators seated behind <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> to see <b>the</b> field, specifically the home plate area. Unlike most other sports, the primary action in baseball is centered on one area - home plate - and obstructing this area from fans' view, even if by players on the bench, would not be popular with fans.|$|R
5000|$|Three rows {{of nearly}} 2,000 seats were added along the field between <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> and <b>the</b> foul poles.|$|R
5|$|Shearer took a brief role in <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> for {{his final}} three games under Glenn Roeder.

5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz.

He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E

In an interview, Bieber said that the video was inspired by his love for sports.|$|E
5|$|During his suspension, Ramirez {{was allowed}} to work out at the Dodgers' {{facilities}} and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> where he remained {{the rest of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> with his head in his hands.|$|E
50|$|Farther {{from the}} infield {{on either side}} are <b>the</b> <b>dugouts,</b> where <b>the</b> teams and coaches sit when they're not on the field. They are named such because, at the {{professional}} levels, this seating is {{below the level of}} the playing field so as to not block the view from prime spectator seating locations. In amateur parks, <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> may be above-ground wooden or CMU structures with seating inside, or simply benches behind a chain link fence.|$|R
50|$|In {{both the}} National League and American League, more home team <b>dugouts</b> are on <b>the</b> first-base side (9 to 6 each). Even the two oldest parks {{still in use}} differ on this point: the Cubs sit on the third-base side at Wrigley while the Red Sox inhabit <b>the</b> first-base <b>dugout</b> at Fenway. Due to the ballpark's orientation, at Wrigley <b>the</b> third-base <b>dugout</b> faces away from the sun from noon onward, whereas <b>the</b> first base <b>dugout</b> faces {{sunlight}} in the late innings. At Fenway, <b>the</b> third-base <b>dugout</b> faces <b>the</b> sun for part of a day game, while <b>the</b> first-base <b>dugout</b> remains shaded.|$|R
50|$|During a 51's Game on August 22, 2015, {{the stadium}} sewage system backed up, causing raw sewage to flow into <b>the</b> <b>dugouts.</b> <b>The</b> smell {{was so strong}} that players were forced to watch the rest of the game from chairs on the field.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, Barrett {{made headlines}} {{again when he}} {{got into a fight}} with teammate Carlos Zambrano. During a game against the Atlanta Braves on June 1, 2007, tensions began to rise between the two players when the Cubs allowed the Braves to score five runs in the fifth inning. The Braves recorded 20 hits, en route to winning 8-5. However, their productivity became overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett. As the two returned to <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> they had an exchange of words, which escalated into a small fight. After Lou Piniella dismissed the two from the game, another fight ensued within the Cubs’ clubhouse, and Zambrano punched Barrett's lip. The wound required Barrett {{to go to the hospital}} immediately and receive stitches. Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after the ordeal, and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences. Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{strained}} {{an oblique}} muscle in 2011 spring training {{and opened the}} season on the DL. He was activated from the DL on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA {{in his first two}} games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.|$|E

Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.|$|E
5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> and players complained that he was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2011, the Bleacher Creatures chanted Jorge Posada's name {{after his}} recent feud with Yankee management, despite Posada not {{playing in the}} game. Posada {{acknowledged}} them from <b>the</b> <b>dugout.</b>|$|E
