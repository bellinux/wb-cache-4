5|$|Djedkare Isesi (known in Greek as Tancherês) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, {{the eighth}} and {{penultimate}} {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty in the late 25th century to mid-24th century BC, during the Old Kingdom period. Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the smooth <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E

5|$|The song {{falls into}} the idiom of {{previous}} minstrel music, relying on rhythm and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its melody is simple and the harmony little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare.

5|$|Burial 21 was {{the first}} corbel-vaulted tomb to be {{constructed}} in the Mundo Perdido; it was placed within Structure 5D-86. The deceased was interred upon the east-west axis running through {{the centre of the}} E-Group during the <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic periods. The tomb was elite-status and was perhaps the earliest royal burial in the Mundo Perdido. Any funerary offerings were removed during the 6th century AD during remodelling of the temple, at which time the offerings were redeposited under the third chamber of the shrine. The offerings included three polychrome plates with mammiform legs; the painted designs on the plates perhaps have astronomical significance.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton laid out the paths and driveways and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. The Screen and the Arch originally formed a single composition, {{designed to provide a}} monumental <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> Hyde Park and Green Park, although the arch was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when the arch was re-sited.|$|E
