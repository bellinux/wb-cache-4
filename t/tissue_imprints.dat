40|$|Following an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of tritiated thymidine to neonatal mice, livers and spleens were removed and their labelling indices were derived autoradiographically. This {{was done in}} a number of ways: (1) from <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> on gelatinised glass slides; (2) from tissue embedded in JB 4 plastic sectioned at thicknesses of 2, 5 and 7 micron; and (3) from tissue embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 7 micron. The results show that the indices from the JB 4 embedded sections increase as the section thickness decreases, and that this relationship persists down to the notional section thickness of zero in the <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> (in which all the cells are in contact with the autoradiographic emulsion). Indices from the 7 micron paraffin wax embedded sections are surprisingly close to the values from the imprints, are higher than indices from the 5 and 7 micron JB 4 embedded sections, and are not significantly different (at the 2 % level) from those from 2 micron JB 4 embedded sections. Possible reasons for these results are discussed in respect of the autoradiographic process and in relationship to various mathematical correction factors which have been proposed to take account of beta-particle self-absorption in thick sections. It is concluded that none of these correction factors is of value and that the embedding medium has an important effect on the observed labelling indices. Comparisons between labelling indices, therefore, should be made only when they are derived from similarly embedded material at the same section thickness...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe insulin-like {{growth factor}} 2 (Igf 2) gene encodes a potent growth factor that is {{expressed}} in multiple tissues during embryonic development.

40|$|Background: Classification of Babesia parasites has {{traditionally}} relied on morphological differentiation based on piroplasm size and shape. Molecular typing has subsequently revealed {{a more complex}} taxonomy for these piroplasms than previously thought. To evaluate {{the factors that influence}} the morphology of Babesia species upon microscopic examination and hence, their taxonomic classification, we performed detailed characterizations of piroplasms from archival and prospective collections of cytological samples of dogs with piroplasmosis before and after death. Merozoite morphology and time of parasite disappearance following imidocarb dipropionate was also investigated. Methods: The study was divided into a (i) review of archived cytological slides from confirmed cases of canine piroplasmosis, and (ii) a prospective study of smears and <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> from 15 recently necropsied dogs. The latter group could be further sub-divided into a non-treated group and an imidocarb dipropionate-treated group. Exact times of treatment before death were reviewed. Additional blood smears prepared from the live dogs and taken before therapy were also evaluated in the latter group. Parasite burden per each slide was determined in both studies. The shape and size of merozoites were described from blood smears taken while the dogs were alive and from different organs during necropsy. The results of all measurements were statistically analyzed. Results: The morphology and size of merozoites from live dogs corresponded to that of previously described 'large' Babesia. The morphology and size of merozoites were significantly different (P < 0. 001) in postmortem samples, however, and more consistent in shape and size with piroplasm cells previously referred to as 'small' Babesia. PCR and sequencing confirmed B. canis as the causative agent of disease in all investigated dogs, including in postmortem negative <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> from dogs treated at least 24 h before death. Conclusions: Changes in the morphology of 'large' B. canis to 'small'-like Babesia observed by light microscopy appear to represent a common postmortem change. Classification of Babesia parasites into 'large' and 'small' Babesia using only microscopy of postmortem slides should be treated with caution.

40|$|To retest the {{hypothesis}} that imprint cytology {{may be used to}} reliably diagnose parathyroid tissue and, if so, to ascertain whether accuracy in this technique may be easily attained. STUDY DESIGN: Imprint preparations from 15 parathyroid, 10 thyroid, 8 lymphoreticular and 2 adipose tissue specimens were assessed blindly by two pathologists, one of whom (pathologist B) had only limited experience with endocrine <b>tissue</b> <b>imprint</b> cytology. RESULTS: Both assessors consistently distinguished parathyroid and thyroid preparations from lymphoreticular and adipose tissue preparations. While there was occasional difficulty in distinguishing between parathyroid and thyroid preparations, this was usually attributable to the scanty nature of the preparations. No single cytologic feature allowed a distinction between parathyroid and thyroid tissue. However, by considering several relatively diagnostic features collectively, pathologist B showed an increase in specificity and sensitivity rates for distinguishing parathyroid from thyroid imprints from 82 % to 100 % and 57 % to 83 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high accuracy rates and rapid learning curve shown by imprint cytology in distinguishing between different neck or mediastinal tissue types, together with its time- and cost-cutting potential, support a role for the technique in the intraoperative diagnosis of parathyroid tissue...|$|R
40|$|Annexin 7 (ANX 7) {{acts as a}} tumor {{suppressor}} gene in prostate cancer, where loss of heterozygosity and reduction of ANX 7 protein expression is associated with aggressive metastatic tumors. To investigate the mechanism by which this gene controls tumor development, we have developed an Anx 7 (+/-) knockout mouse. As hypothesized, the Anx 7 (+/-) mouse has a cancer-prone phenotype. The emerging tumors express low levels of Anx 7 protein. Nonetheless, the wild-type Anx 7 allele is detectable in laser-capture microdissection-derived tumor tissue cells. Genome array analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue indicates that the Anx 7 (+/-) genotype is accompanied by profound reductions of expression of several other tumor {{suppressor gene}}s, DNA repair genes, and apoptosis-related genes. In situ analysis by <b>tissue</b> <b>imprinting</b> from chromosomes in the primary tumor and spectral karyotyping analysis of derived cell lines identify chromosomal instability and clonal chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, whereas 23 % of the mutant mice develop spontaneous neoplasms, all mice exhibit growth anomalies, including gender-specific gigantism and organomegaly. We conclude that haploinsufficiency of Anx 7 expression appears to drive disease progression to cancer because of genomic instability through a discrete signaling pathway involving other tumor suppressor genes, DNA-repair genes, and apoptosis-related genes...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{bioactive}} metabolites {{are often}} heterogeneously expressed in tissues both spatially and over time. Therefore, traditional solvent extraction methods {{benefit from an}} understanding of the in situ sites of biosynthesis and storage to deal with heterogeneity and maximize yield. Recently, surface-assisted mass spectrometry (MS) methods namely nanostructure-assisted laser desorption ionisation (NALDI) and desorption ionisation on porous silicon (DIOS) surfaces have been developed to enable the direct detection of low molecular weight metabolites. Since direct tissue NALDI-MS or DIOS-MS produce complex spectra due to the wide variety of other metabolites and fragments present in the low mass range, we report here the use of “on surface” solvent separation directly from mollusc tissue onto nanostructured surfaces for MS analysis, as a mechanism for simplifying data annotation and detecting possible artefacts from compound delocalization during the preparative steps.

The percentages of cells containing either tadpole or frog hemoglobin were estimated within the experimental error of the method. The data showed that the two hemoglobins are in different cells.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{proximal}} {{region of}} murine Chr 2 {{has long been}} known to harbour one or more imprinted genes from classic genetic studies involving reciprocal translocations. No imprinted gene had been identified from this region until our study demonstrated that the PcG gene Sfmbt 2 is expressed from the paternally inherited allele in early embryos and extraembryonic <b>tissues.</b> <b>Imprinted</b> genes generally reside in clusters near elements termed Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), suggesting that Sfmbt 2 might represent an anchor for a new imprinted domain. Results We analyzed allelic expression of approximately 20 genes within a 3. 9 Mb domain and found that Sfmbt 2 and an overlapping non-coding antisense transcript are the only imprinted genes in this region. These transcripts represent a very narrow imprinted gene locus. We also demonstrate that rat Sfmbt 2 is <b>imprinted</b> in extraembryonic <b>tissues.</b> An interesting feature of both mouse and rat Sfmbt 2 genes is the presence of a large block of miRNAs in intron 10. Other mammals, including the bovine, lack this block of miRNAs. Consistent with this association, we show that human and bovine Sfmbt 2 are biallelic. Other evidence indicates that pig Sfmbt 2 is also not imprinted. Further strengthening the argument for recent evolution of Sfmbt 2 is our demonstration that a more distant muroid rodent, Peromyscus also lacks imprinting and the block of miRNAs. Conclusions These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the block of miRNAs are driving imprinting at this locus. Our results are discussed in the context of ncRNAs at other imprinted loci. Accession numbers for Peromyscus cDNA and intron 10 genomic DNA are [Genbank: HQ 416417 and Genbank: HQ 416418], respectively. </p...|$|R

Maize roots and rice shoots and roots from 7 -day seedlings shifted to low temperature (10 °C) contained as much as 15 -fold more Adh 1 mRNA and 8 -fold more ADH 1 protein activity than the corresponding tissues from untreated seedlings. Time-course studies showed that these tissues accumulated Adh 1 mRNA and ADH 1 activity severalfold within 4 - to 8 -hour, levels plateaued within 20 to 24 hours, and remained elevated at 4 days of cold treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background Genes {{subject to}} genomic {{imprinting}} are mono-allelically {{expressed in a}} parent-of-origin dependent manner. Each imprinted locus {{has at least one}} differentially methylated region (DMR) which has allele specific DNA methylation and contributes to imprinted gene expression. Once DMRs are established, they are potentially able to withstand normal genome reprogramming events that occur during cell differentiation and germ-line DMRs are stably maintained throughout development. These DMRs, in addition to being either maternally or paternally methylated, have differences in whether methylation was acquired in the germ-line or post fertilization and are present in a variety of genomic locations with different Cytosine-phosphate guanine (CpG) densities and CTCF binding capacities. We therefore examined the stability of maintenance of DNA methylation imprints and determined the normal baseline DNA methylation levels in several adult <b>tissues</b> for all <b>imprinted</b> genes. In order to do this, we first developed and validated 50 highly specific, quantitative DNA methylation pyrosequencing assays for the known DMRs associated with human imprinted genes. Results Remarkable stability of the DNA methylation imprint was observed in all germ-line DMRs and paternally methylated somatic DMRs (which maintained average methylation levels of between 35 % - 65 % in all somatic tissues, independent of gene expression). Maternally methylated somatic DMRs were found to have more variation with tissue specific methylation patterns. Most DMRs, however, showed some intra-individual variability for DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood, suggesting that more than one DMR needs to be examined in order to get an overall impression of the epigenetic stability in a tissue. The plasticity of DNA methylation at imprinted genes was examined in a panel of normal and cancer cell lines. All cell lines showed changes in DNA methylation, especially at the paternal germ-line and the somatic DMRs. Conclusions Our validated pyrosequencing methylation assays can be widely used as a tool to investigate DNA methylation levels of imprinted genes in clinical samples. This first comprehensive analysis of normal methylation levels in adult somatic <b>tissues</b> at human <b>imprinted</b> regions confirm that, despite intra-individual variability and <b>tissue</b> specific expression, <b>imprinted</b> genes faithfully maintain their DNA methylation in healthy adult tissue. DNA methylation levels of a selection of imprinted genes are, therefore, a valuable indicator for epigenetic stability. </p...|$|R

The technique is based on specific hybridization of small labeled DNA fragments, the probes, to complementary sequences in a target DNA molecule. Demand for FISH assays in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues has been increasing, mainly in conditions in which diagnosis is not achieved in cell smears or <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints,</b> such as solid tumors. Moreover, the development of molecular targeted therapies in oncology has expanded the applicability of tests to predict sensitivity or resistance to these agents. The efficient use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as therapeutical agents in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) depends on identification of patients likely to show clinical benefit from these specific treatments.

An endosperm formed in sexual reproduction between diploid parents is typically triploid, with a 2 : 1 ratio of maternal genetic material (denoted as 2 m : 1 p). Variation from this ratio affects endosperm size, indicating parent-specific expression of genes involved in endosperm growth and development. The presence of paternally or maternally imprinted genes {{can be explained by}} parental conflict over the transfer of nutrients from maternal to offspring <b>tissue.</b> Genomic <b>imprinting</b> can, for example, provide the male parent of an embryo in a mixed-paternity seed pod, with an opportunity for expressing its preference for a disproportionate allocation of resources to its embryo. It has been argued that a diploid 1 m : 1 p endosperm was ancestral and the 2 m : 1 p endosperm evolved after parental conflict, to improve maternal control over seed provisioning. We present a population genetic model, which instead places the origin of triploidy early in the parental conflict over resource allocation. We find that there is an advantage to having a triploid endosperm as the parental conflict continues. This advantage can help to explain why the 2 m : 1 p endosperm prevails among flowering plants...|$|R

The parameters that affect the extraction efficiency of solid-phase extraction were investigated, including solvent of extraction, volume of loading sample, washing and elution solvent, etc. Good linearity was obtained {{in a range of}} 0. 05 ~ 15 µg/mL with correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 9991. The recoveries at three spiked levels were ranged from 91. 4 % to 101. 0 % with RSD less than of 5. 0 %...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGenomic {{imprinting}} is {{a developmental}} mechanism that mediates parent-of-origin-specific expression in {{a subset of}} genes. How the <b>tissue</b> specificity of <b>imprinted</b> gene expression is controlled remains poorly understood. As a model to address this question, we studied Grb 10, a gene that displays brain-specific expression from the paternal chromosome. Here, we show in the mouse that the paternal promoter region is marked by allelic bivalent chromatin enriched in both H 3 K 4 me 2 and H 3 K 27 me 3, from early embryonic stages onwards. This is maintained in all somatic tissues, but brain. The bivalent domain is resolved upon neural commitment, during the developmental window in which paternal expression is activated. Our data indicate that bivalent chromatin, in combination with neuronal factors, controls the paternal expression of Grb 10 in brain. This finding highlights a novel mechanism to control tissue-specific imprinting...|$|R
40|$|The Bear Gulch Limestone Member is {{proposed}} herein {{as the new}} name for the Bear Gulch Beds of central Montana, USA. This member contains articulated and exceptionally well preserved fossils.;Taphonomic investigation, employing scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive x-ray analysis, element mapping, electron microprobe analysis and Raman spectroscopy reveals that original carbonate biominerals underwent early dissolution, whereas original apatite was converted to carbonate fluorapatite. Non-mineralised tissues were rapidly replaced by apatite and more rarely calcite, or are evident as <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints.</b> In some cases fossil morphology is preserved in organic action. The sediment lacks both clay and iron and so previous models for carbon preservation cannot be invoked. Geochemical analysis shows that calcite and quartz dominate the sediment.;Bottom water conditions were periodically inimical to benthos. Reducing environments within the sediment and relatively rapid burial rates must have assisted in the preservation processes, including macroscavenger inhibition.;Coiled cephalopods are found encrusted with Sphenothallus, 'microconchids', bryozoans and orbiculoid brachiopods. Sphenothallus demonstrates holoperipheral cover and preferred growth orientation on two cephalopods. This suggests that sphenothallids colonised the cephalopods in vivo. Articulated polychaete jaw apparatuses, Brochosogenys reidiae and Symmetrioprion n. sp. are described. The latter is the first record of the genus from the Carboniferous and the first assemblage of Symmetrioprionidae found with the remains of its body.;Halicyne montanaensis n. sp. is recorded from the deposit. Several specimens with different styles of preservation have enabled its identification as a new species of cycloid...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> on Giemsa stained slides from {{dogs were}} used to {{investigate}} the presence of Leishmania amastigotes by either optical microscopy (OM) or Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of DNA. Samples from skin, spleen, lymph node, liver and bone marrow from a Leishmaniasis endemic area dogs where Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi and Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis are sympatric were studied. Dogs were initially diagnosed by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF), as which 39 were IIF positive (> or = 1 : 40) and 16 negative. The IIF positive dogs were clinically grouped as symptomatic (n = 15), oligosymptomatic (n = 12) and asymptomatic (n = 12). Although PCR positivity was higher in symptomatic dogs, specially their skin samples, {{there was no significant}} difference among clinical groups or organs examined. Ten (62. 5 %) out of 16 IIF and OM negative animals were positive for PCR in at least one organ. Forty-eight positive PCR amplicons were further submitted to RFLP for Leishmania identification. All dogs were infected with L. (L.) chagasi except one, infected with L. (V.) braziliensis. PCR was more efficient than IIF and OM to diagnose canine visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL), regardless of the organ examined and the clinical form present. The use of PCR together with serology helps determining the extension of sub clinical infection in CVL endemic areas and provides a better estimate of the number of dogs to be targeted for control measures. In conclusion, our data reinforce the need for a specific diagnosis of canine infection in areas where diverse Leishmania species are sympatric and demonstrate that PCR-RFLP can be used to identify Leishmania species in dog tissue imprint stained slide...|$|E
40|$|The protistan {{parasite}} Mikrocytos mackini, the causative {{agent of}} Denman Island {{disease in the}} oyster Crassostrea gigas in British Columbia, Canada, is of wide concern because it can infect other oyster species and because its life cycle, mode of transmission, and origins are unknown. PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were developed for M. mackini, the PCR assay was validated against standard histopathological diagnosis, and a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the M. mackini small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) was undertaken. A PCR designed specifically not to amplify host DNA generated a 544 bp SSU rDNA fragment from M. mackini-infected oysters and enriched M. mackini cell isolates, but not from uninfected control oysters. This fragment was confirmed by FISH to be M. mackini SSU rDNA. A M. mackini-specific PCR was then designed which detected 3 to 4 x more M. mackini infections in 1056 wild oysters from Denman Island, British Columbia, than standard histopathology. Mikrocytos mackini prevalence estimates based on both PCR and histopathology increased (PCR from 4. 4 to 7. 4 %, histopathology from 1. 2 to 2. 1 %) when gross lesions were processed in addition to standard samples (i. e. transverse sections for histopathology, left outer palp DNA for PCR). The use of histopathology and <b>tissue</b> <b>imprints</b> plus PCR, and standard samples plus observed gross lesions, represented a 'total evidence' approach that provided the most realistic estimates of the true prevalence of M. mackini. Maximum parsimony and evolutionary distance phylogenetic analyses suggested that M. mackini may be a basal eukaryote, {{although it is not}} closely related to other known protistan taxa.

40|$|Polycomb group (PcG) {{proteins}} are key chromatin regulators {{implicated in}} multiple processes including embryonic development, <b>tissue</b> homeostasis, genomic <b>imprinting,</b> X-chromosome inactivation, and germ cell differentiation. The PcG proteins recognize target genomic loci through cis DNA sequences known as Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), which are well characterized in Drosophila. However, mammalian PREs have been elusive until two groups reported putative mammalian PREs recently. Consistent with {{the existence of}} mammalian PREs, here we report the identification and characterization of a potential PRE from human T cells. The putative human PRE has enriched binding of PcG proteins, and such binding is dependent on a key PcG component SUZ 12. We demonstrate that the putative human PRE carries both genetic and molecular features of Drosophila PRE in transgenic flies, implying that not only the trans PcG proteins but also certain features of the cis PREs are conserved between mammals and Drosophila...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} nanoassisted laser desorption-ionization mass {{spectrometry}} (NALDI-MS) imaging to provide selective chemical monitoring with proper {{spatial distribution of}} lipid profiles from tumor <b>tissues</b> after plate <b>imprinting</b> has been tested. NALDI-MS imaging identified and mapped several potential lipid biomarkers in a murine model of melanoma tumor (inoculation of B 16 /F 10 cells). It also confirmed that the in vivo treatment of tumor bearing mice with synthetic supplement containing phosphoethanolamine (PHO-S) promoted an accentuated decrease in relative abundance of the tumor biomarkers. NALDI-MS imaging is a matrix-free LDI protocol based on the selective imprinting of lipids in the NALDI plate followed by {{the removal of the}} tissue. It therefore provides good quality and selective chemical images with preservation of spatial distribution and less interference from tissue material. The test case described herein illustrates the potential of chemically selective NALDI-MS imaging for biomarker discovery. FAPESPFAPESPCNPqCNPqCAPESCAPE...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{thermal infrared}} imaging is a pioneering method giving indices of sympathetic activity via the contact-free recording of facial <b>tissues</b> (thermal <b>imprints).</b> Compared to established stress markers, the great {{advantage of this}} method is its non-invasiveness. The goal of our study was to pilot the use of thermal infrared imaging in the classical setting of human stress research. Thermal imprints were compared to established stress markers (heart rate, heart rate variability, finger temperature, alpha-amylase and cortisol) in 15 participants undergoing anticipation, stress and recovery phases of two laboratory stress tests, the Cold Pressor Test and the Trier Social Stress Test. The majority of the thermal imprints proved to be change-sensitive in both tests. While correlations between the thermal imprints and established stress markers were mostly non-significant, the thermal imprints (but not the established stress makers) did correlate with stress-induced mood changes. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that {{in contrast to the}} established stress markers the thermal imprints could not disambiguate anticipation, stress and recovery phases of both tests. Overall, these results suggest that thermal infrared imaging is a valuable method for the estimation of sympathetic activity in the stress laboratory setting. The use of this non-invasive method may be particularly beneficial for covert recordings, in the study of special populations showing difficulties in complying with the standard instruments of data collection and in the domain of psychophysiological covariance research. Meanwhile, the established stress markers seem to be superior {{when it comes to the}} characterization of comple...|$|R
