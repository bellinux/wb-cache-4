40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityDivorce has become so prevalent that it is almost the norm for children. Adolescents whose parents divorce are mandated to share their time with each parent as outlined in their parents' or court-imposed parenting plans. It is not known how these adolescents experience or feel about <b>their</b> <b>divorced</b> parents' parenting plans because most information regarding adolescents and divorce comes primarily from parents and other third parties, and these plans likely are developed without input from the adolescents. This exploratory qualitative study uses an attachment and family systems theoretical framework to describe the experiences of adolescents with <b>their</b> <b>divorced</b> parents' parenting plans. Using a phenomenological design, data was collected primarily during a focus group with four adolescents, aged 14 and 16 whose parents divorced {{while they were in}} this age range, in Oregon's Sixth Judicial District. The primary research question, how do adolescents experience <b>their</b> <b>divorced</b> parents' parenting plans, was answered through seven secondary questions. Nine themes emerged in their responses. Results suggest that adolescents are ill informed about parenting plans and <b>their</b> nexus to <b>divorce.</b> Recommendations emanating from this study are the need for (a) better communication between parents and adolescents regarding the legal implications of divorce and parenting plans, (b) renegotiation of family boundaries, and (c) giving adolescents voice in the development of their parents' parenting plans. Finally, {{there is a need for}} replicating this research to establish a solid foundation for understanding adolescents' experiences with their parents' parenting plans. This foundation could lead to improved divorce policy and practice in the development of parenting plans...|$|R
