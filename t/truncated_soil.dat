30|$|With {{that aim}} in mind, the focus here {{is on the}} 1 D {{response}} of horizontally stratified soil columns, and on investigating the relationships between corresponding amplification factors on response spectra, and limited number of “site proxies” describing the overall characteristics of the soil profile. A series of 858 real soil profiles are considered, and their linear viscoelastic responses to vertically incident S waves are computed for 14 distinct, real input waveforms spanning {{a wide range of}} frequency contents. For each site, the geometric average amplification factor is derived from these 14 different loadings, and an artificial neural network approach is used to investigate the correlation between this average amplification factor and various sets of soil characteristics. Sensitivity studies are performed to identify the relative performance of several site proxies, with the goal of proposing optimal combination sets offering a good compromise between physical relevancy and practical affordability. The robustness of the results is tested by conducting the same analysis on two additional sets of soil profiles, termed normalized soil profiles (NP) and <b>truncated</b> <b>soil</b> profiles (TP), modified to correspond to a uniform bedrock velocity of 800  m/s.|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the Holocene sediment dynamics at Mount Kalkriese in the Wiehengebirge mountains (northwestern Germany) shows that the onset {{and the extent of}} human land use corresponds well with most colluvial archives in Central European loess regions: The onset of soil erosion in the Wiehengebirge mountains started during the Early Neolithic period. For the Bronze Age, erosion and colluviation are documented as well. A considerable increase of soil erosion with correlated reworking of colluvial sediments was found since Roman times, indicated by the burial of Germanic artifacts of Roman Age at the toe-slopes. Unfortunately, no absolute ages exist for the post roman period. However, in analogy to other sites it can be assumed that highest erosion rates occurred during the Middle Ages. This study also shows typical problems when using the soilscape model for calculating the sediment budget: since <b>truncated</b> <b>soil</b> profifi les are used to model eroded volumes, only minimum soil erosion is mapped. This can lead to a considerable discrepancy between eroded and accumulated volumes. Therefore, we have to assume that soil erosion at the plateau and in upslope areas at Mount Kalkriese was much higher than predicted by the soilscape model. In addition, extensive anthropogenic accumulation soils (Plaggen soils) were deposited in the downslope areas, thereby increasing the discrepancy between erosion and accumulation volumes. The combination of mapping erosion and accumulation with augerings and trenches, calculation of the mass balance by GIS, relative and absolute dating and geophysical evidence provides a powerful tool in landscape interpretation. Due to the small number of numerical ages, the landscape model at Mount Kalkriese has to be considered preliminary...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultural}} occurrences on Macho and Waso {{indicate that}} man {{made use of}} the hills as living sites as early as 10, 000 years ago at Eth- 73 - 3 -III and that occupation has continued to as late as 230 years ago. Waso hill {{was used as a}} burial ground as late as World War II according to our workmen, who identified some stone cairns near area A and the brow of the hill. It was more than 10, 000 years ago that the area became available for occupation as the once extensive lake receded and the Jiills were exposed and became accessible from the southeastern end of Gademotta ridge: The desirability of these hills probably became less and less as the lake shore became more remote from them and it was not until rather recently that they were again occupied by Neolithic stockherders who had the necessary ceramic technology to maintain a water supply at some distance from the lake. The three excavated occurrences represent a subsistence technology based on tools made predominantly from blades "punched" from cores. It is impossible to place an end date on this tradition based on information from the sites but it did occur before or with the ash fall event some 1450 years ago. It is likely, considering the dates obtained by Clark from the Lake Bekasa area, that it ended many years before the ash fall or at least the technological system had undergone a considerable transformation by that point in time. The youngest excavated horizon is likely that found on Waso hill, Eth- 73 - 3 - 1, but this cannot be argued conclusively, even though it lies immediately below the pumice cap. It is not known, since there is no means to independently date the occurrence, if the site has not lain on the surface for millennia or was not once buried within a now <b>truncated</b> <b>soil</b> profile that at one time had a yellow-brown zone corresponding to that occurring at Macho hill. It is unquestioned that Eth- 73 - 1 represents the most intensive occupation of the three excavated. Site Eth- 73 - 3 -I likely dates between the other two buried occurrences. At least it is seemingly strati- graphically above Eth- 73 - 3 -III in reference {{to the base of the}} pumice cap. But the sites are horizontally displaced some 75 M. and the stratigraphie zones in which they are located are not sedimentary but pedological. Thus their positions within these soil zones may have more to do with the topography of the hill as the soil developed on a stabilized surface just prior to the ash fall than they do with the topography of the hill when it was occupied. They may even be contemporaneous. Only Eth- 73 - 3 -III is dated with a technically reliable date to 10, 330 B. P. The surface feature, Eth- 73 - 3 -II, is definitely a late event and evidently represents the very specific activity of hide working, very similar to that observed by Gallagher (1971) among the Gurage, the Arussi-Galla, and the Sidamo. These scrapers, based on the date reported by Clark (1974), may have been an item in the tool kits used in the area for some 3500 years and occupations such as Eth- 73 - 3 -II offer unique situations where the characteristics of prehistoric activity areas may be determined using ethnographically generated hypotheses. Once some characteristics are known, it may be possible to more reliable identify and spatially delimit activity areas in archaeological sites of the more remote past. Comparative typological studies with other assemblages of similar technology from East Africa will be reported when completed. A study of use-wear markings on the tools from the excavated occurrences is also in progress. It has been found that these obsidian tools, when microscopically observed under the appropriate lighting conditions, show striations (scratch marks) that suggest how the tools were used. Using the assumption that morphologically similar tools exhibiting the same patterned use-wear marks were used for the same task, it is feasible to extend the completed morphological tool typology to a functional typology. Such use- wear studies will not reveal the function, either physical or cultural, of the tools but they can tell something about the motions involved in the specific task for which the tool was used. It is theorized that such studies may eventually, when significant and sufficient numbers are completed, help the prehistorian identify more precisely the activity areas occurring at a site. This in turn should become an additional source of information for generating and testing ecological models of man's cultural use of past environments. Humphreys Gerald K.

40|$|Tillage erosion {{had been}} {{identified}} as a major process of soil redistribution on sloping arable land. The objectives of our study were to investigate the extent of tillage erosion and its effect on soil quality and productivity under Danish conditions. Soil samples were collected to a 0. 45 -m depth on a regular grid from a 1. 9 -ha site and analyzed for 137 Cs inventories, as a measure of soil redistribution, soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and phosphorus (P) contents. Grain yield was determined at the same sampling points. Substantial soil redistribution had occurred during the past decades, mainly due to tillage. Average tillage erosion rates of 2. 7 kg m− 2 yr− 1 occurred on the shoulderslopes, while deposition amounted to 1. 2 kg m− 2 yr− 1 on foot- and toeslopes. The pattern of soil redistribution could not be explained by water erosion. Soil organic carbon and P contents in soil profiles increased from the shoulder- toward the toeslopes. Tillage translocation rates were strongly correlated with SOC contents, A-horizon depth, and P contents. Thus, tillage erosion had led to <b>truncated</b> <b>soils</b> on shoulderslopes and deep, colluvial soils on the foot- and toeslopes, substantially affecting within-field variability of soil properties. We concluded that tillage erosion has important implications for SOC dynamics on hummocky land and increases the risk for nutrient losses by overland flow and leaching. Despite the occurrence of deep soils across the study area, evidence suggested that crop productivity was affected by tillage-induced soil redistribution. However, tillage erosion effects on crop yield were confounded by topography–yield relationships...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado en la EGU General Assembly 2016 (European Geosciences Union), celebrada en Viena del 12 al 17 de abril de 2015. The {{rational}} use of soil {{requires the}} selection of management practices to take profit of the beneficial functions of plant growth, water and nutrient storage, and pollutants removal by filtering and decomposition without altering its properties. However, the first evidence of important and widespread erosion peaks can generally be found {{with the arrival of}} the first farmers all over the world. In areas with a long land-use history such as the Mediterranean, clear signs indicating the advanced degradation status of the landscape, such as heavily <b>truncated</b> <b>soils,</b> are visible throughout. Soil conservation practices are then aimed at reducing erosion to geological rates, in equilibrium with long-term soil formation rates, while maximizing agricultural production. The adoption of such practices in most areas of the world are as old as the earliest soil erosion episodes themselves. This work firstly reviews historical evidence linking soil management and soil erosion intensity, with examples from N Europe and the Mediterranean. In particular, work by the authors in olive orchards will be presented that shows how significant variations in soil erosion rates between could be linked to the historical soil management. The potential of historical documents for calibrating a soil erosion model is shown as the model, in this case RUSLE-based and combining tillage and water erosion, adequately represents the measured erosion rate dynamics. Secondly, results from present-day, long-term farm experiments in the EU are reviewed to evaluate the effect of different soil management practices on physical soil properties, such as bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate stability, runoff coefficient or sediment yield. Finally, we reflect upon model and field data that indicate how future global climate change is expected to affect soil management and erosion and how the examples used above hold clues about sustainable historical management practices that can be used successfully in the future.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a computational (finite element analysis) study for numerically simulating the elastic wave propagation {{problem in a}} two-dimensional homogeneous half space. The theoretical formulations of {{development and implementation of}} local non-reflecting boundary condition (NRBC) at the <b>soil</b> <b>truncated</b> boundaries has been discussed in detail. A dynamic analysis of the elastic soil domain using time marching scheme has been carried out and comparative studies of the responses from different boundary conditions at the truncated boundaries also has been provided to get the physical idea of the wave reflection phenomena and its absorption capability using NRBCs. The results justify the utility of implementing the local types of NRBC's on the truncated boundaries of the soil domain for solving coupled dynamic problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{successional}} affinity of nine {{woody species}} was inferred from the structure, diversity and disturbance {{history of the}} vegetation where these occurred. This was done {{in order to obtain}} a basis for a restoration experiment, currently in execution, in the dry Andean dwarf forest zone {{on the edge of the}} High Plain of Bogotá (Colombia), at 2600 - 2950 m. a. s. l. We laid out 101 relevees in grassland and shrubland types in different stages of recovery, and in relatively little disturbed endemic Condalia thomasiana dwarf forest. The disturbance history of sites over the last ~ 60 years was inferred from aerial photograph series (1941 - 1991). CCA and logistic regression were applied to relate species composition to diversity, environment and disturbance history. All species showed a preference for certain structural groups. Also, a clear relation between species occurrence and vegetation diversity was found. Baccharis macrantha, and Dalea coerulea appeared relatively tolerant to grazing, while the remaining seven species reacted negatively. Soil clay content, base availability and organic carbon content was also an important factor for occurrence of each species. Invasion of grasslands by woody species is pioneered by Baccharis macrantha and followed by Dodonaea viscosa. Dalea coerulea was predominantly found on <b>truncated</b> clayey <b>soils,</b> which will probably not support Condalia dwarf forest. The hypothesized classification of the nine planted species to either pioneers or late-successional was fine-tuned. This exploratory study will be of use in the set-up of future succession-based restoration experiments, and for converting exotics afforestations to natural vegetatio...|$|R
40|$|Aims The aim of our {{research}} was to understand small-scale effects of topography and soil fertility on tree growth in a forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment in subtropical SE China. Methods Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out at a spatial resolution of 5 × 5 m. Soil samples of different depth increments and data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m 2 each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon [SOC]), nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth attributes. Important Findings In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in stable soil properties suggest that <b>soil</b> erosion has <b>truncated</b> the <b>soils</b> {{to a large extent}} over the whole area of the experiment. This explains the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely due to the convexity of the footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte–Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50 cm depth. Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1 – 2 years of growth, among which C stocks proved to be most important while pHKCl and CEC only played minor roles. Nevertheless, soil acidity and a high proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after only 1 – 2 years growth. Hence, our study showed that forest nutrition is coupled to a recycling of litter nutrients, and does not only depend on subsequent supply of nutrients from the mineral soil. Besides soil fertility, topography affected tree height. We found that especially MCCA as indicator of water availability affected tree growth at small-scale, as well as aspect. Overall, our synthesis on the interrelation between fertility, topography and tree growth in a subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China showed that topographic heterogeneity lead to ecological gradients across geomorphological positions. In this respect, small-scale soil–plant interactions in a young forest can serve as a driver for the future development of vegetation and biodiversity control on soil fertility. In addition, it shows that terrain attributes should be accounted for in ecological research...|$|R
