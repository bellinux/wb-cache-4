40|$|Purpose: This study aims to empirically {{investigate}} the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity (AC), <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> jointly influence product innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a research model {{to examine the}} mediating role of AC on the impacts of <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> on product innovation and the moderating roles of <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> {{on the relationship between}} AC and product innovation. The hypotheses are empirically tested using regression and bootstrapping methods and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. Findings: This study finds that <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> positively affect product innovation and the effects are fully mediated by AC. AC also significantly enhances product innovation and the effect is amplified by trust as well as <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition, the results show that <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> improve AC both individually and interactively. Originality/value: The findings extend existing knowledge on the antecedents of AC and the contingent conditions under which a manufacturer’s AC is more effective than that of its rivals. The results also clarify the mechanisms through which <b>trust</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> improve product innovation. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among a manufacturer’s sociotechnical systems, knowledge management processes and new product development, and reveals how to design organisational systems to fully capitalise the value of AC on product innovation...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding {{the obvious}} {{potential}} advantages {{of information and}} communications technology (ICT) in the enhanced provision of healthcare services, there are some concerns associated with integration of and access to electronic health records. A security violation in health records, such as an unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised alteration of an individual's health information, can significantly undermine both healthcare providers' and consumers' confidence and trust in e-health systems. A crisis in confidence in any national level e-health system could seriously degrade the realisation of the system's potential benefits. In response to the privacy and security requirements {{for the protection of}} health information, this research project investigated national and international e-health development activities to identify the necessary requirements {{for the creation of a}} <b>trusted</b> health <b>information</b> <b>system</b> architecture consistent with legislative and regulatory requirements and relevant health informatics standards. The research examined the appropriateness and sustainability of the current approaches for the protection of health information. It then proposed an architecture to facilitate the viable and sustainable enforcement of privacy and security in health <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> under the project title "Open and <b>Trusted</b> Health <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (OTHIS) ". OTHIS addresses necessary security controls to protect sensitive health information when such data is at rest, during processing and in transit with three separate and achievable security function-based concepts and modules: a) Health Informatics Application Security (HIAS); b) Health Informatics Access Control (HIAC); and c) Health Informatics Network Security (HINS). The outcome of this research is a roadmap for a viable and sustainable architecture for providing robust protection and security of health information including elucidations of three achievable security control subsystem requirements within the proposed architecture. The successful completion of two proof-of-concept prototypes demonstrated the comprehensibility, feasibility and practicality of the HIAC and HIAS models for the development and assessment of trusted health systems. Meanwhile, the OTHIS architecture has provided guidance for technical and security design appropriate to the development and implementation of <b>trusted</b> health <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> whilst simultaneously offering guidance for ongoing research projects. The socio-economic implications of this research can be summarised in the fact that this research embraces the need for low cost security strategies against economic realities by using open-source technologies for overall test implementation. This allows the proposed architecture to be publicly accessible, providing a platform for interoperability to meet real-world application security demands. On the whole, the OTHIS architecture sets a high level of security standard for the establishment and maintenance of both current and future health <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> This thereby increases healthcare providers‘ and consumers‘ trust in the adoption of electronic health records to realise the associated benefits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Information</b> <b>systems</b> must {{establish}} <b>trust</b> {{to cooperate}} effectively in open environments. We are developing an agent-based approach for establishing <b>trust,</b> where <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are modeled as agents that provide and consume services. Agents can {{help each other}} find trustworthy parties by providing referrals to those that they trust. We propose a graph-based representation of services for modeling the trustworthiness of agents. This representation captures natural relationships among service domains and provides a simple means to accommodate the accrual of trust placed in a given party. When interpreted as a lattice, it enables less important services (e. g., low-value transactions) {{to be used as}} gates to more important services (e. g., high-value transactions). We first show that, where applicable, this approach yields superior efficiency (needs fewer messages) and effectiveness (finds more providers) than a vector representation that does not capture the relationships between services. Next, we study trade-offs between various factors that affect the performance of this approach. ...|$|R
