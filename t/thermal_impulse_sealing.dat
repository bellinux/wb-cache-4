In particular, the impact of repetitively pulsed x‐ray sources are examined: the short duration (1 – 100 nsec) pulses induce large step changes in mask temperatures, which can, in turn, induce a dynamic response. The impact of conductive cooling of the mask is to reduce the repetitively pulsed problem to a series of isolated nearly identical <b>thermal</b> <b>impulses</b> of duration approximately equal to the cooling time.

For whatever deep or arbitrary reason, sulfate molecules injected into the stratosphere can offset the radiative forcing effect of the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, with spectacular efficiency. A single kilogram of sulfate particles of appropriate size could negate the <b>thermal</b> <b>impulse</b> imparted by at least two hundred thousand and perhaps three hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide.

In spite of the extensive experimental and theoretical studies on single layer graphene (SLG), its thermal properties {{have not yet been}} fully addressed and vast work need to be done to reveal the phonon transport mechanism within this micro/nanoscale material. A transient molecular dynamics technique is developed to characterize the thermophysical properties of two-dimensional graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). By directly tracking the thermal relaxation history of GNR that is heated by a <b>thermal</b> <b>impulse,</b> we are able to determine its thermal diffusivity fast and accurate. In the right-angle bended GNR system, three peculiar features about the phonon energy transport have been observed for the first time. An energy inversion phenomenon has been observed during the transient thermal transport in GNR system. Phonon energy coupling among different phonon modes are investigated and it is found that both dynamic and static heat sources can evoke the energy inversion in GNR. The unique thermal properties of GNR enable it to support a bi-directional heat transfer in the system. And when the bi-directional heat conduction reaches steady state, a single thermal conductivity cannot be used to reflect the relation between the heat flux and the temperature gradient. The calculated thermal conductivities are dependent on the net heat fluxes and the app of graphene are calculated at positive, negative, zero and infinite values, depending on the proportions of each phonon mode energy added/subtracted to/from the heating/cooling areas.

40|$|The general {{problems}} of particle {{motion in the}} vicinity of a flat, non-deforming fluid interface is studied. The approximate singularity method used by previous workers in this research group has been generalized to consider the motion of a sphere in any linear velocity field compatible with the existence of the undisturbed flat interface, and the motion of slender rod-like particles which undergo an arbitrary translation or rotation in either a quiescent fluid or in a linear flow. The theory yields the hydrodynamic mobility tensors which are necessary to describe Brownian movement near a phase boundary, as well as general trajectory equations for sedimenting particles near a fluid interface with an arbitrary viscosity ratio. These approximate solution results are in good agreement with both exact-solutions where they are available and experimental data for motion of a sphere near a rigid plane wall. Among the most interesting results for motion of slender bodies is the generalization of Jeffery orbit equations for linear simple shear flow. The Brownian motion of a sphere {{in the presence of a}} deformable fluid interface is also examined. First, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived for the random distortions of interface shape that are caused by spontaneous <b>thermal</b> <b>impulses</b> from the surrounding fluids. This analysis is carried out using the method of normal modes in conjunction with a Langevim type equation for the Brownian particle, and results in the prediction of autocorrelation functions for the location of the interface, for the random force acting on the particle (evaluated by a generalization of the Faxen's law), and for the particle velocity. The particle velocity correlation, in turn, yields the effective diffusion coefficient due to random fluctuations of the interface shape. Finally, we investigate the effects of interface deformation that are induced by the impulsive motion of a sphere that is undergoing Brownian motion. In this phase of our study, we consider both the spatially modified hydrodynamic mobility which occurs as a consequence of hydrodynamic interactions, and influence on the mean-square displacement of the Brownian particle of the interface relaxation back towards the flat equilibrium configuration after an initial deformation that is caused by the particle motion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical solution of the unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by Peshkov and Romenski [110], further denoted as HPR model. In that framework, the viscous stresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A, {{which is one of the}} primary state variables in the proposed first order system. A very important key feature of the HPR model is its ability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous compressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well as the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. Actually, the model treats viscous and inviscid fluids as generalized visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution equations of A. Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic system for the <b>thermal</b> <b>impulse,</b> from which the heat flux is computed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the first and the second principle of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first order Maxwell–Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible thermodynamics. The HPR model represents therefore a novel and unified description of continuum mechanics, which applies at the same time to fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. In this paper, the direct connection between the HPR model and the classical hyperbolic–parabolic Navier–Stokes–Fourier theory is established for the first time via a formal asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit. From a numerical point of view, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source terms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step ADER–WENO finite volume (FV) and ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes to the HPR model in the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or numerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations. Numerical convergence results are also provided. To show the universality of the HPR model, the paper is rounded-off with an application to wave propagation in elastic solids, for which one only needs to switch off the strain relaxation source term in the governing PDE system. We provide various examples showing that for the purpose of flow visualization, the distortion tensor A seems to be particularly useful...|$|R

All bags were held at 4. 4 °C, 80 % RH and assessed for reduction in quality during storage per a commercial (in-house) standard utilized by a large pre-cut salad packer in Salinas, California. When the biodegradable films were sealed with a VFFS machine equipped with a thermal-bar heat sealer, a 52. 5 % fail rate was observed due to the non-continuity of the seals. Leaks were found when bags were vacuum tested to 14 in Hg absolute for 15 seconds. However, a 45. 5 % fail rate was also observed for commercial bags made using the same VFFS machine, suggesting similar seal concerns for current industry film structures. Though an attempt was made to only store bags that were sealed properly, bags made from the biodegradable films sealed with the thermal-bar did not perform as well as the commercial packages and the shelf-life of the pre-cut Romaine was shortened.

La 2 Zr 2 O 7 as {{the thermal}} barrier coating {{material}} draws more and more attention because of its greater thermal physical properties than YSZ, while its further application is restricted by its poor mechanical properties. In this paper, certain ZrO 2 is added into the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 ceramics {{in order to improve}} its mechanical properties. La 2 Zr 2 O 7 ceramic superfine powder was synthesized by the co-precipitation method and samples of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 (x = 0 ~ 30 %) were prepared by pressureless sintering process. The microstructure and properties of the samples were investigated by SEM, XRD, three-point bend tests, SENB, laser <b>impulse</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity instrument and high-temperature expansion instrument. Owing to the partial solid solubility in the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 ceramics, ZrO 2 exists in the form of m-ZrO 2 and t-ZrO 2. With the addition of ZrO 2, the mechanical properties of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 ceramics first increase, then decrease. When the addition amount of ZrO 2 reaches 20 %, the fracture toughness comes to the greatest value 2. 41 MPa·m 1 / 2. When the addition amount of ZrO 2 reaches 10 %, the bending strength comes to the greatest value 202. 4 MPa. The thermal conductivity of the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 ceramics is lower than YSZ. The thermal conductivity of the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 ceramic decrease at 1400 °C as the addition amount of ZrO 2 increases, resulting from the higher intrinsic thermal conductivity of ZrO 2 than that of La 2 Zr 2 O 7. The thermal expansion coefficient of the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 -xZrO 2 ceramics decreases slowly after about 350 °C and decrease rapidly at about 1000 °C, and then increase rapidly due to the transformation of m-ZrO 2 to t-ZrO 2...|$|R
