25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} by {{columnist}} James Bovard of The American Conservative for requiring protesters to stay within a designated area, while allowing supporters access to more areas. According to the Chicago Tribune, the American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal court in Washington D.C. to prevent the Secret Service from keeping anti-Bush protesters distant from presidential appearances while allowing supporters to display their messages up close, where {{they are likely to}} be seen by the news media.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2007, President Bush {{issued an}} {{executive}} order officially banning torture of POWs by intelligence officials. Amnesty International points out that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> narrowly defined torture under the Bybee memo, at the time, the only known one of the Torture Memos. While the US is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, it has failed to ratify {{that portion of the}} Geneva Convention, Protocol I, which would grant such persons POW status as the detainees at Guantanamo.

2500|$|Council of Foreign Relations fellow Peter Beinart {{argued that}} [...] "It is terribly unfortunate that MoveOn.org is {{essentially}} calling Petraeus a Republican hack, but it’s the logical {{result of the}} position <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> put him in." [...] Fellow Max Boot accused Moveon.org of [...] "desperate attempts to besmirch {{one of the most}} admired soldiers in the entire American armed forces" [...] and argued that the ad will [...] "backfire".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, George Packer, {{author of}} The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq and New Yorker {{magazine}} staff writer, {{wrote an article}} about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program.

[...] The following poll question was used: [...] "Question: Do you strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree that the work of the Israel lobby on Congress and <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been a key factor for going to war in Iraq and now confronting Iran?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Human Rights Watch, the {{umbrella}} organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: [...] "Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements {{on human rights}} exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras...The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, {{not only because the}} contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2005, the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw {{announced}} that, after [...] "intensive {{and complex}} discussions" [...] between his {{government and the}} US, the remaining four British nationals in Guantanamo Bay would be returned [...] "within weeks". [...] While they were still regarded as [...] "enemy combatants" [...] by the US government, it had brought no specific charges against them. The New York Times and CNN reported that Bush had released Begg as a favour to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was being harshly criticised in the UK for his support of the Iraq war. The Atlantic claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{tried to make a}} gag order a condition of Begg's release, but that this would not have been acceptable to the British public.|$|E
2500|$|John Yoo, {{legal advisor}} to <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>has</b> {{explicitly}} invoked Federalist No. 70 in {{his support for}} executive power over foreign policy. Referencing Hamilton, Yoo has claimed that [...] "the centralization of authority in the President is particularly crucial in matters of national defense, war, and foreign policy, where a unitary executive can evaluate threats, consider policy choices, and mobilize national resources with a speed and energy that is far superior to any other branch.” [...] Yoo has also cited Federalist No. 70 in his support of the President’s right to unilaterally conduct operations against terrorists without congressional consent. He claims that this power applies to operations against both individuals and states. At least one scholar has also argued that, because {{the president has the}} most access to national security information, only the president can know when the War on Terror is over and no longer mandates an expansive executive authority.|$|E

The memos were granted only after [...] "repeated requests" [...] from the CIA, who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue. Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority.
