5|$|Disraeli left {{much of the}} {{detailed}} work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during <b>the</b> <b>congress,</b> <b>and</b> again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

50|$|The {{self-executing}} rule {{began in}} the 1930s. From the 95th to <b>the</b> 98th <b>Congresses</b> (1977-1984) <b>the</b> self-executing rule was used eight times, 20 times under Speaker O’Neill (D) in <b>the</b> 99th <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> 18 times under Speaker Wright (D) in <b>the</b> 100th <b>Congress.</b> Under Speaker Gingrich (R) there were 38 self-executing rules in <b>the</b> 104th <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> 52 in <b>the</b> 105th <b>Congress</b> (1995-1998).

5|$|If {{the bell}} was rung, {{it would have}} been most likely rung by Andrew McNair, who was the doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> was {{responsible}} for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, it might have been rung by William Hurry, who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Jinnah and Gandhi, who had by then been {{released}} from his palatial prison, met formally at the Muslim leader's home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks followed between them, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to come into being immediately, while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence. In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the League should form an interim government {{with the members of}} the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.|$|E
5|$|Srinivasa Sastri met Indian {{independence}} activist Gopal Krishna Gokhale for {{the first}} time in 1906. He was drawn towards Gokhale's Servants of India Society and joined the organization becoming its President in 1915. He joined the Indian National Congress in 1908 and became the Secretary of the Madras District Congress Committee in 1911. As a member of the Congress, he was instrumental in bringing about a pact between <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the Muslim League.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, but the nation established its good credit. Many in <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere in the government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Local {{elections}} {{were held in}} October. The mayor of Buenos Aires, Aníbal Ibarra, was reelected in a runoff against Mauricio Macri. Neither were Peronists, but Ibarra supported Kirchner and Macri was supported by Duhalde. Duhalde remained an influential figure in the Buenos Aires province; his ally Felipe Solá was elected governor by a landslide, and the PJ received its highest number of deputies since 1983 and won mayoral elections in several cities lost to the UCR in 1999. The three leading candidates in the Buenos Aires province were all Peronists. Victories in the other provinces gave the PJ control of <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> three-quarters of Argentina's governors were Peronists. According to journalist Mariano Grondona, Argentine politics had become a dominant-party system.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E

5|$|The main {{political}} parties are the Left Front and the All India Trinamool Congress with the Bharatiya Janata Party having limited support base along with regional parties like IPFT, INPT and the Indian National Congress. Until 1977, {{the state was}} governed by the Indian National Congress. The Left Front was in power from 1978 to 1988, and then again from 1993 onwards. During 1988–1993, <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti were in a ruling coalition. In the last elections held in February 2013, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly, 49 of which went to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). As of 2013, Tripura {{is one of the}} two states in India where the communist party is in power. The other state is Kerala. Formerly, one more state—West Bengal—had democratically elected communist governments.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E
5|$|While {{the flag}} {{agitation}} got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers {{of the time}} attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{admission}} of Maine as a state, he was again elected as a Democratic-Republican to <b>the</b> Seventeenth <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> reelected as an Adams-Clay Republican to <b>the</b> Eighteenth <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> elected as a Pro-Adams candidate to <b>the</b> Nineteenth <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> served from March 4, 1821, until his resignation some time in 1826. He served as Governor of Maine from 1827 until his death. He won three terms, all with over 90% of the vote. He did not run for a fourth term.|$|R
50|$|Carter {{was elected}} as a Democratic-Republican to <b>the</b> Seventeenth <b>Congress</b> to fill <b>the</b> vacancy {{caused by the}} {{resignation}} of James Blair.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah {{was trained}} as a {{barrister}} at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and {{took an interest in}} national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.|$|E
