500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring. Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist so I had to put one more album out. I didn't want to get famous so I kept all the songs I wanted and {{had a lot of fun}} making it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Led Zeppelin was {{inducted}} into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The television broadcasting of the event consisted of an introduction to the band by various famous admirers (including Roger Taylor, Slash, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Jack White and Tony Iommi), a presentation of an award to Jimmy Page and then a short speech by the guitarist. After this, rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin, playing the song [...] "Communication Breakdown". [...] During an interview for the BBC in connection with the induction, Page expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying: [...] "It's an album that I really need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> system...there's a good album in there and it's ready to come out" [...] and [...] "Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{reckoned}} that at {{the rate}} of walking of a team of oxen we covered about two miles an hour.

So now I had to turn my mind upon how I was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> barrel. I had thought of several ways, and was balancing one against the other when the question was decided for me in a very simple but unexpected manner.|$|E

How that string of horses kept their feet is a miracle; but they dashed ahead, over-running one another, galloping, trotting, stumbling, jumping, scrambling, and kicking methodically skyward every time a wasp landed on them. After a while we drew breath and counted our injuries. And this happened not once, nor twice, but time after time. Strange to say, it never grew monotonous. I know that I, for one, came through each brush with the undiminished zest of a man flying from sudden death. No; the pilgrim from Taiohae to Typee will never suffer from ennui on the way.|$|E
