40|$|We {{consider}} the initial value problem for <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> one dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), where <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> {{is assumed to}} be fast compared to the evolution of the unforced equation. This suggests the introduction of two time scales. Solutions to <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> NLS are sought by expressing the dependent variable in modulus-phase form and expanding in powers of a small parameter, which is inversely related to <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> time scale. This system is similar to a forced eikonal-transport system arising in nonlinear geometrical optics. We focus on the effect that <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> has on <b>the</b> NLS standing solitary wave. Solutions to second order in the expansion are computed analytically for some specific choices of <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> function. A general conclusion of this work is that the effect of <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> on <b>the</b> phase variable is quite important in determining the overall structure of <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> solitary wave. © 1995 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Heraclius launched a surprise night attack on the Sasanian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his harem, baggage, and men.|$|E

5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
