5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annulment, no {{progress}} seemed possible. The Pope seemed {{more afraid of}} Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore the Pope, but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E
5|$|Tiring of {{the back}} and forth, fair leaders demanded a meeting with Mint {{officials}} to settle <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design. The Company was in severe financial straits, and money {{from the sale of}} the coins was needed. Leech agreed to send Barber to Chicago, where he met with the Finance Committee on September 23, 1892. It was agreed that the obverse would be based on the badges, and the reverse on Warner's caravel concept.|$|E

5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stolen money. Morrison {{claims to be}} working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} and final legislation designating the wilderness area included provisions for land swaps between {{private and public}} holders. The Central Oregon Irrigation District, which was neutral on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wilderness itself, supported the proposed legislation because it would benefit from the land swap.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{rotational}} barrier of ethane is not settled within the scientific community. An analysis within quantitative molecular orbital theory shows that 2-orbital-4-electron (steric) repulsions are dominant over hyperconjugation.

25|$|In the Ainu language, {{the word}} kamuy {{refers to an}} animistic concept very similar to Japanese kami. <b>The</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words' origins is still a subject of debate; several {{hypotheses}} about their similarities exist: the Japanese word was borrowed from the Jomon/Ainu language, or are cognates of an extremely distant common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|The {{belief that}} the bread and wine that form <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist become the body and blood of Christ {{appears to have been}} {{widespread}} from an early date, with early Christian writers and referring to them as his body and the blood. They speak of them as the same flesh and blood which suffered and died on the cross.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there was}} <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ruhr. Although the Ruhr area still {{contained}} {{a significant number}} of Axis troops and enough industry to retain its importance as a major objective, Allied intelligence reported that much of the region's armament industry was moving southeast, deeper into Germany. This increased the importance of the southern offensives across the Rhine.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to <b>the</b> {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1993 Constitution <b>of</b> Russia, <b>the</b> administrative-territorial structure <b>of</b> Russia was {{regulated by}} <b>the</b> Decree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RSFSR <b>of</b> August 17, 1982 [...] "On <b>the</b> Procedures <b>of</b> Dealing with <b>the</b> <b>Matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Administrative-Territorial Structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RSFSR". The 1993 Constitution, however, {{did not identify}} <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administrative-territorial divisions as <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government nor as <b>the</b> joint responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{federal government and the}} subjects. This was interpreted by <b>the</b> governments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal subjects as a sign that <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administrative-territorial divisions became solely <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal subjects. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another.

25|$|The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is also {{investigating}} {{to determine}} if any federal safety regulations were violated.

25|$|Hypatia's {{death is}} also told in another source, The Chronicle, written by John of Nikiû in Egypt around 650. This account demonizes Hypatia and Orestes directly, while validating all Christians {{involved}} in the events John describes. The Chronicle is more biased on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical feud, omitting several points of the narrative that are included in Socrates' account.|$|E

On recounting his experience with Tell the Governor, Hayden says [...] "What I remember most about it was, first, it keeps you in touch. It keeps you in touch with reality."

25|$|Windthorst and the Centre Party were dismayed {{at being}} sidelined {{and not being}} {{consulted}} about the concessions the pope made, e. g. about the ban on Jesuits or the civil registry of clerics. None of the party’s major demands were met. Instead, the pope even sided with Bismarck on non-religious issues and pressured the Centre Party to support Bismarck or at least abstain, e. g. in <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotly debated Septennat 1887 (7-year military budget).|$|E
