This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> are native to North America.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public.

He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> the itch.|$|E
