This impact is assessed by the sensitivity or elasticity of the matrix elements that are computed from life cycle data such as age-dependent survival or fecundity. Covariation among life cycle components, e. g., due <b>to</b> <b>trade-</b> offs, is a main subject of life history theory. Sensitivities or elasticities of matrix elements do not take this covariation into account. Integrated sensitivities and elasticities measure {{the net effect of}} a matrix element, combining its direct effect and indirect effects through correlation with other matrix elements. These measures are related to the selection differentials and expected selection responses from quantitative genetics. The use of these measures is illustrated with data on disease resistance in a perennial weed Plantago lanceolata, and the demography of killer whale pods.

Differential equations are too heavy tools for dealing with the multiple spatial interactions which generate and regulate the evolution of the settlements system. Cellular automata, in extended forms such as multi-agents systems, are more promising in this respect. They allow the simulation of a wide complexity of spatial interactions including mechanisms of cooperation and competition between settlements.

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a ten-step process that generates qualitative and quantitative data. Seven NGT groups were conducted in the south-west region of the UK, three with General Practitioners and nurses, three with chronic pain patients, and one with Healthcare Commissioners. Findings – The patient agenda for service development focused on process of care issues particularly the need for deep- empathy and emotional support from providers, while professionals prioritised cost-effectiveness. While there was some overlap between agendas they were largely discrete and often contradictory. Research limitations/implications – The findings imply service planners will need <b>to</b> make <b>trade-</b> offs between cost-containment and patient satisfaction. The methodology did not allow trade-offs to be put to participants in a structured form. However, such techniques are available, for example, Conjoint Analysis. There may also be value in bringing together patients and professionals in joint focus groups, to see if the gap between their different agendas can be bridged through discussion.

The author shows that the books provide evidence of a steady China’s interest to Latin America and the Caribbean as well as a scale-up of diplomatic relationships and bilateral trade of commodities. At the same time, the ability of Latin American countries to provide an effective response to the Chinese attempts to use the bilateral arrangements in order to strengthen its participation in regional organizations is rather weak. This scenario allows a progressive and effective impact of China in the region to continue.

This paper sets out <b>to</b> examine <b>trade-,</b> foreign- and security policy implications of the issues confronting the region. In ASEAN, the Southeast Asian countries are continuing their ambitious attempts at further integration. Plans outlining deeper security and economic communities have been adopted. However, huge differences in political systems, economic development and ethnic/religious structures are hampering prospects of closer cooperation. The highly controversial conflict case of Burma/Myanmar is testing the much adhered-to principle of non-interference {{and at the same time}} complicating relations with external powers. Among these, the United States and China are dramatically strengthening their interests in the region. American influence is not least manifesting itself in light of the war against terrorism, which the region is adapting to in different ways and at different speeds. By contrast, the European Union does not seem to answer Southeast Asian calls for further engagement. A flurry of bilateral and regional trade agreements is another prominent feature of the economic landscape of the region. This is to a certain degree a reflex ion of impatience with trade liberalization in the WTO and within ASEAN itself. Structures of economic cooperation are under rapid alteration in Southeast Asia. The paper analyses the above-mentioned developments with a view to assessing the prospects of future stability, economic development and integration in and among ASEAN countries. It is concluded that although the scope for increased economic benefit and political harmonization through ASEAN integration alone is limited, the organization could still prove useful as a common regional point of reference in tackling more important policy determinants at national and global level...|$|R

The presence of an enforcement mechanism increased subjects’willingness to ratify treaties; however, strategic reasoning had double the effect of adding enforcement to a trade agreement: more strategic subjects were particularly likely to favor ratifying the agreement.

Modern German economic historiography has, for a long time, concentrated research mainly on industry and big business, taking up the paradigm of “heroic ” history from the traditional writing of political history.

Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density technology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform computation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior (storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that can embed computation with storage. This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances of the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of memristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based content addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over large datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes a concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data structures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS processor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable memristor technologies for lower levels. We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and use analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data structures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our configurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive applications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries. Furthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data structures provide opportunities <b>to</b> tune the <b>trade-</b> off between performance and lifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or other technologies with improved endurance...|$|R

Although this increased collaboration across multiple disciplines has yielded tremendous benefit, it makes the design process substantially more difficult. Engineers must communicate frequently across all the disciplines, and they can no longer design in isolation. Therefore, efficient algorithms that are capable of facilitating interaction across multiple engineering disciplines are required. Moreover, the collaboration across multiple disciplines tends to increase the size of the optimization problems. When multiple disciplines are considered, more elements of the system have to be accounted with greater accuracy. As a result, size of engineering optimization problems has increased exponentially in recent years. However, many classical optimization algorithms are not suited to solve optimization problems with a large number of design variables (large-scale). The goal of this research is to create a flexible multidisciplinary optimization algorithm that is capable of solving large-scale optimization problem by improving known optimization techniques.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} challenges, decisions, issues, and dilemmas facing the International Community (IC) {{in attempting to}} re-establish and rebuild public administration and other government institutions {{in a country that}} continues to suffer from instability and remains at high risk of further conflict. The research looks specifically at a subset of Public Administration Reform (PAR) : Civil Service and Administrative Reform (CSAR). The research concludes that CSAR in a Fragile and Conflict Affected State (FCAS) such as Afghanistan is clearly a ‘wicked problem’ requiring innovative, iterative and adaptive responses by the IC over an extended time period. However, the IC treats CSAR in Afghanistan as a ‘tame’ problem simply framed in terms of ‘we are coming to build your capacity’, resulting in slow progress on public sector reform overall and little understanding of the relationship with overarching statebuilding and stabilisation objectives. Despite the acknowledgement of the importance of CSAR, IC support has fallen dramatically in recent years. The current approach to supporting CSAR in Afghanistan is therefore almost guaranteed to fail. The research calls for a new approach to PAR in these types of cases, one that recognises the severe limits to progress utilising existing approaches and structures rooted in Western notions of good government. A new approach goes beyond the overwhelming focus on capacity development; emphasises the importance of understanding what space exists for reform; recognises the need <b>to</b> pragmatically confront <b>trade-</b> offs between the competing objectives of reconciling stabilisation imperatives with wider considerations of ‘good governance’; and poses an alternative expanded framework for considering public administration, legitimacy, authority and representation in the government of an FCAS, partly as an organising framework but also as an aid to understanding the complexity of interrelated systems prevalent in an FCAS. The research also concludes that a great deal more independent academic research is required to understand how to make progress in Public Sector Reform (PSR), stabilisation and longer-term development that will help prevent countries slipping back into conflict...|$|R
40|$|This report assesses {{technology}} {{requirements for}} reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in California to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 {{as required by}} Executive Order S- 3 - 05 (2005). Details of this analysis, assumptions and data {{are to be found}} in forthcoming reports, including a detailed analyses for specific energy technologies. The present document serves to synthesize the results and present the major findings. The challenge of meeting these GHG emission targets is large:•    By 2050, California’s population is expected to grow from the 2005 level of 37 million to 55 million. Even with moderate economic growth and business-as-usual (BAU) efficiency gains, we will need roughly twice as much energy in 2050 as we use today. •    To achieve the 80 % reduction goal, California’s greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall from 470 MtCO 2 e/yr (million metric tons of CO 2 equivalent per year) in 2005 to 85 MtCO 2 e/ yr in 2050, with most of those emissions (77 MtCO 2 e/yr) coming from the energy sector. Accomplishing this will require a reduction from about 13 tons CO 2 e per capita in 2005 to about 1. 6 tons CO 2 e per capita in 2050. This study has developed a set of energy system “portraits”, each of which meets the challenge of providing the energy needed for future growth while striving to achieve the required greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We use the term energy system portrait to mean a set of energy sources, carriers and end-use technologies that meet all the energy needs of Californians projected for 2050. An energy system portrait describes an end-state or target energy system that could be a goal for California. This study connects related sectors of the energy system in order <b>to</b> account for <b>trade-</b> offs and inter-relationships.

However, the primary goals of safety and efficiency are to some extent conflicting. In fact, to deliver a greater level of safety, separation between aircrafts {{would have to be}} greater than it currently is, but this would negatively impact the efficiency. In an attempt <b>to</b> avoid the <b>trade-</b> off between these goals, the long-range vision for the Single European Sky in- cludes objectives for operating as safely and efficiently in Visual Meteorological Conditions as in Instrument Meteorological Conditions. In this respect, a wide set of virtual/augmented reality tools has been developed and effectively used in both civil and military aviation for piloting and training purposes (e. g., Head-Up Displays, Enhanced Vision Systems, Synthetic Vision Systems, Combined Vi- sion Systems, etc.). These concepts could be transferred to air traffic control with a relatively low effort and substantial benefits for controllers’ situation aware- ness. Therefore, this study focuses on the see-through, head-tracked, head-up dis- play that may help controllers dealing with zero/low visibility conditions and in- creased traffic density at the airport. However, there are several open issues as- sociated with the use of this technology. One is the difficulty of obtaining a con- stant overlap between the scene-linked symbols and the background view based on the user’s viewpoint, which is known as ‘registration’. Another one is the presence of multiple, arbitrary oriented Head-Up Displays (HUDs) in the control tower, which further complicates the generation of the Augmented Reality (AR) content. In this paper, we propose a modified rendering pipeline for a HUD sys- tem that can be made out of several, arbitrary oriented, head-tracked, AR dis- plays. Our algorithm is capable of generating a constant and coherent overplay between the AR layer and the outside view from the control tower. However a 3 D model of the airport and the airport’s surroundings is needed, which must be populated with all the necessary AR overlays (both static and dynamic). We plan to use this concept as a basis for further research in the field of see-through HUDs for the control tower...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{have long}} been {{interested}} in measuring the extent, effects and causes of agricultural price and trade policies. The topic has drawn attention because agricultural trade between countries has almost never been free, {{and yet it is}} widely accepted that trade policy distortions affect the incentives of producers and consumers and cause a redistribution of resource use in the economy. Traditional aggregations of agricultural price and trade distortions can be poor guides to the economic effects of agricultural price and trade policies. Measures without theoretical foundation — such as simple- or trade-weighted average price distortions — may introduce biases in analysis. Recent decades have seen improvements in aggregation theory in the form of scalar index numbers of the trade- and welfare-reducing effects of price and trade policies. Despite the new theory, however, analysts have continued to use less satisfactory measures in practice. This thesis calculates partial-equilibrium versions of trade restrictiveness indices from the Anderson-Neary family of indices for agricultural policy distortions in 75 developed and developing countries over a period 1960 to 2007. The data for the empirical work are from the recently released World Bank Distortions to Agricultural Incentives database. The thesis calculates indices at the country level for the sample countries. Two partial-equilibrium indices are calculated — a Trade Reduction Index (TRI) and a Welfare Reduction Index (WRI). ¹ The TRI (WRI) is the uniform trade tax that yields the same loss in trade volume (welfare) as the structure of disaggregated distortions. The results of the country-level estimates show that standard weighted averages of price distortions understate the extent of global distortion from agricultural policies. One manuscript of the thesis focuses in particular on the trade restrictiveness of agricultural policy in Sub-Sahara Africa, and finds that weighted averages greatly understate the extent of regional distortion from agricultural policy by netting out offsetting distortions in exportable and import-competing sectors. The thesis also calculates indices of agricultural policy distortions for individual commodity markets. Whereas all previous work within the trade restrictiveness indices literature has focused on constructing index numbers of distortions {{from the perspective of a}} single country, this thesis proposes taking a global view instead for individual commodity markets. Indices are estimated for 28 key agricultural commodities. Generally, the indices are well above weighted-averages of price distortions. The most distorted global markets are the milk, sugar and rice markets. The thesis also employs the Anderson-Neary framework <b>to</b> consider the <b>trade-</b> and welfare-reducing effect of individual policy instruments. The aim of the work is to determine the relative contributions of different policy instruments to reductions in global trade and welfare over time and across countries. The most significant result empirically is the importance of export taxes pre- 1990 s and their substantial contribution to the fall in global trade- and welfare-restrictiveness of agricultural policy over the past two decades. Finally, the thesis examines the extent to which the Protection for Sale Model (PFS) of Grossman and Helpman (1994) holds for agricultural sectors at different stages of development. The test uses a new methodology proposed by Imai, Katayama and Krishna (2008). The Distortions to Agricultural Incentives dataset is used for the analysis. The PFS model is estimated in a cross-country setting, which allows for examination of the role of different government institutional factors in PFS framework. ¹ The definition of the acronym TRI in this thesis is different to that used by Anderson and Neary and several others who have adopted their definition.
