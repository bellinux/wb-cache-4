5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries {{to cut off the}} locks to remove the vest, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions {{for them to have}} arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, {{but it is not}} known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{the local}} {{education}} authority has judged that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> primary school {{places in the}} town and has published proposals to reduce them.

Tvetdnes and Roper responded by noting that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> coincidences for such an assessment to be credible.|$|E
25|$|Electron capture is a {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} that will occur when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> protons in {{the nucleus of}} an atom and insufficient energy to emit a positron. However, {{it continues to be}} a viable decay mode for radioactive isotopes that can decay by positron emission. K-electron capture was discovered by Luis Alvarez, who demonstrated it in 1937 and reported it in The Physical Review in April 1938.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{governments of}} {{mainland}} China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan have standardized official stroke orders {{to be taught}} in schools. These stroke order standards are prescribed in conjunction to each government's standard character sets. The various official stroke orders agree on {{the vast majority of}} characters, but each have their differences. No governmental standard matches traditional stroke orders completely. The differences between the governmental standards and traditional stroke orders arise from accommodation for schoolchildren who may be overwhelmed if the rules about stroke orders are too detailed, or if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> exceptions. The differences listed below are not exhaustive.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, {{a large number of}} downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the more downloaders the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
25|$|The Kurdish Academy of Language (KAL) realises that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> {{shortcomings}} {{with current}} Kurdish writing systems. These include workability, cross dialectal usage, {{and a lack}} of International IT-based Standards and representation for Kurdish. To avoid the communication obstacles presented by the existence of various Kurdish writing systems, KAL has introduced a standard Kurdish Unified Alphabet (Yekgirtú) based on International ISO-8859-1 Standards. This modern Kurdish (IS) alphabet contained some minor changes in the existing Latin based alphabet and adopting new signs. The new signs were introduced to improve the flexibility of the writing system in Kurdish. This effort was undertaken as part of KAL's broad endeavour to revive and promote the use of the Kurdish language for the benefit of young Kurds. The system devised and presented here by KAL is simple and adequate for the purpose of communicating via the Internet and any electronic media.|$|E

25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the assessment criteria. Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the assessment criteria with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. Students who do graduate may still {{find it hard to}} get work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{observers}} such as British daily The Guardian and CNNs Richard Quest, {{as well as}} {{the city}} administration itself, has linked the issue of cyclist behavior to the city's novel problem of bike congestion; there are simply too many bicycles, relative to the infrastructure provided. During the morning and afternoon rush hour, it is not uncommon that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> cyclists for all to cross during green light cycles at intersections along the busy corridors. Another rush hour issue is lack of space on busy sections of the bicycle path network, with cyclists moving at different speeds without much leeway, creating an intimidating atmosphere for kids, the elderly and inexperienced cyclists. This in turn has created a conflict of space allocation, where cycling advocates claim that too little is done to accommodate the majority of cyclists and pedestrians since only 29.1% of the city's population own a car, while some motorists, including the Danish motoring association, feels that the capital hate cars, and that the city's accommodation of bicycles have already gone too far.|$|E
25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and audio-video materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million babies are born every year which means {{that in a few}} years time, more individuals will assert ownership over their share of the (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino administration has done in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 has tripled. Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E

Kennedy administration.|$|R

A few are Herbie Hancock, Aretha Franklin, and Ryuichi Sakamoto." [...] His interest in composition came about after being inspired by a variety of jazz, electronic, modernist, and pop musicians.|$|E
500|$|However, Hubbard did not record {{these events}} in his diary. He {{remained}} unimpressed with China and the Chinese, writing: [...] "A Chinaman {{can not live}} up to a thing, he always drags it down." [...] He characterized the sights of Beijing as [...] "rubberneck stations" [...] for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as [...] "very trashy-looking" [...] and [...] "not worth mentioning". He was impressed by the Great Wall of China near Beijing, but concluded of the Chinese: [...] "They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> chinks here." ...|$|E

People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit}} of melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
