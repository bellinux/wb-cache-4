5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> take into account the pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

25|$|The final liquor {{is treated}} by blowing carbon dioxide through it. This {{precipitates}} dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H2S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding zinc hydroxide. The liquor {{is separated from}} the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the reverberatory furnace. The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.|$|E
25|$|NAND {{relies on}} ECC to {{compensate}} for bits that may spontaneously fail during normal device operation. A typical ECC will correct a one-bit error in each 2048bits (256bytes) using 22bits of ECC, or a one-bit error in each 4096bits (512bytes) using 24bits of ECC. If the ECC cannot correct the error during read, it may still detect the error. When doing erase or program operations, the device can detect blocks <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> program or erase and mark them bad. The data is then written to a different, good block, and the bad block map is updated.|$|E

25|$|C. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is {{the premier}} inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 {{counties}} (plus New York and London). Each county participates {{in their respective}} provincial championship (in Derry's case the Ulster Championship) which operate through a knock-out cup competition format. The winners {{of each of the}} four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending on how far they reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. See here for more details.|$|E
25|$|A further set of {{physical}} paradoxes {{are based on}} sets of observations <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> be adequately explained by current physical models. These may simply be indications of the incompleteness of current theories. It is recognized that unification has not been accomplished yet which may hint at fundamental problems with the current scientific paradigms. Whether this is the harbinger of a scientific revolution yet to come or whether these observations will yield to future refinements or be found to be erroneous {{is yet to be}} determined. A brief list of these yet inadequately explained observations includes observations implying the existence of dark matter, observations implying the existence of dark energy, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, the GZK paradox, the heat death paradox, and the Fermi paradox.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} architecture {{also features}} specific measures at the decoder {{to reduce the}} suffered distortion due to any SW coded information <b>that</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> decode properly. For this purpose, the principles of successive SI refinement[33] are adopted. The WZ frames are decoded in distinct stages called refinement levels[34], where at each stage, a higher quality version of the SI is generated. Given the improved SI at every refinement level, SW decoding is reattempted for all SW coded information <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> decode at previous levels, when only a poorer version of the SI was available. The proposed decoding process thereby merges SI refinement, SW decoding and reattempts at SW decoding of any SW coded information <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> decode at previous refinement levels. In contrast, the approach in[23] first decodes an entire WZ frame, after which additional SI updates create new opportunities to attempt decoding bit-planes <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> SW decode successfully.|$|R

25|$|The rest of {{the crew}} make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to {{broadcast}} the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe into his sex robot before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon, prompting River to dive through the doors and close them as the Reavers drag her away. At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.|$|E
25|$|TCR {{rearrangement}} {{occurs in}} two steps. First the TCRβ chain is rearranged at the DN3 stage of T cell development. The TCRβ chain is paired with the pre-Tα {{to generate the}} pre-TCR. The cellular disadvantage in the rearrangement process {{is that many of}} the combinations of the T cell receptor gene fragments are non-functional. To eliminate thymocytes which have made a non-functional T cell receptor, only cells that have successfully rearranged the beta chain to produce a functional pre-TCR are allowed to develop beyond the DN3 stage. Cells <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> produce a functional pre-TCR are eliminated by apoptosis. This process is referred to as the beta-selection checkpoint. Successful beta-selection requires that TCRβ is produced, TCRβ is capable of pairing with pre-Tα to generate the pre-TCR, and that the pre-TCR can interact on the cell surface with the TCR signalling proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} the treaty, {{like that of the}} 1997 Ottawa Treaty to limit landmines, has been concern over the severe damage and risks to civilians from {{explosive}} weapons during and long after attacks. A varying proportion of submunitions dispersed by cluster bombs fail to explode on impact and can lie unexploded for years until disturbed. The sometimes brightly colored munitions are not camouflaged, but have been compared to toys or Easter eggs, attracting children at play. Human rights activists claim that one in four casualties resulting from submunitions <b>that</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> explode on impact are children who often pick up and play with the explosive canisters well after the conflict has ended. The 2006 Lebanon War provided momentum for the campaign to ban cluster bombs. The United Nations estimated that up to 40% of Israeli cluster bomblets failed to explode on impact. Norway organized the independent Oslo process after discussions at the traditional disarmament forum in Geneva fell through in November 2006.|$|E
