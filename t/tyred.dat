40|$|To {{cope with}} winter weather conditions, {{potentially}} including snow and ice, {{it is common}} to use winter <b>tyres,</b> or "all-seasons" <b>tyres</b> assumed to be safe both in summer and winter. In some northern countries, winter <b>tyres</b> are mandatory. It is commonly assumed that winter <b>tyres</b> are noisier than normal <b>tyres</b> (here called summer <b>tyres)</b> and winter <b>tyres</b> equipped with studs are assumed to be extra noisy. This paper presents a study where noise and rolling resistance properties of <b>tyres</b> for winter conditions are compared to summer and all-season <b>tyres.</b> The winter <b>tyres</b> include types optimized for central European climate, <b>tyres</b> optimized for Nordic climate and <b>tyres</b> with studs. In total, approx. 50 car <b>tyres</b> have been tested. Noise properties have been measured with the CPX method and rolling resistance has been measured with a trailer method; all measurements made on two road surfaces; SMA 8 and DAC 16. Results indicate that winter <b>tyres</b> are not noisier than summer tyres; except for studded <b>tyres.</b> Despite high differences among individual <b>tyres,</b> rolling resistance is approximately similar among the main types; surprisingly including also studded <b>tyres.</b> An alarming result was that there was no correlation between measured values and values on the <b>tyre</b> labels.
