5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of <b>the</b> <b>plays.</b> But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> {{was not as}} {{successful}} as Fielding's Tom Thumb, which ran alongside Rape upon Rape. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> allowed Fielding to express his political views through comedy.

5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. <b>The</b> <b>plays</b> built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on some of the}} rhetorical aspects of tragedy in order to provide a metatheatrical reading of Seneca’s Medea.

This analysis makes the division of the plot in two levels possible: on the one hand, there is <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of <b>the</b> poet, i. e. the Medea of Seneca; on the other, there is <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of Medea within <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of Seneca, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>play</b> within <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> This approach should offer the reader some meaningful reflections on the rhetorical nature of <b>the</b> <b>play...</b>|$|R

5|$|Blackrock is a play by Australian playwright Nick Enright {{that was}} first {{performed}} in 1995. It {{was adapted from}} a 1992 play by Enright, entitled A Property of the Clan, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, Australia in 1989. <b>The</b> <b>plays</b> were both well received critically, though they did attract criticism from both Leigh's family and the media due to the fictionalisation of an actual murder. Despite repeated statements from Enright that <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> were a work of fiction, they have both often been considered by viewers to be a factual account. A Property of the Clan was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1993, and Blackrock won the AWGIE Award for Best Play in 1996. Blackrock was developed into a feature film of the same name in 1997.|$|E

5000|$|As {{reported}} by Peter Morris, Khoon Ka Khoon was a [...] "recording of a stage production", Modi filmed it using two cameras as <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was being staged. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> was {{a mix of}} Elizabethan costumes for the main leads, {{with a mixture of}} Western stage and Indian costumes for other characters in <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Modi decided to film <b>the</b> <b>play</b> shot by shot as in the staging of <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Mehdi Ahsan, a known writer of the Parsi theatre had earlier adapted <b>the</b> <b>play</b> for <b>the</b> silent film Khoon-e-Nahak (1928), before staging it for Modi.
