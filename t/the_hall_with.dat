5|$|In recent years, Bence has {{received}} many awards acknowledging her long career. In 2006, she was {{honored by the}} Actors Social Work (OSA) and in 2007, she received the inaugural Javolandia Award for lifetime achievement from the Javo Rocha Academy of Theater. She was given a certificate of recognition during the María Guerrero Awards ceremony in 2007 and in 2008 she received the Trinidad Guevara Achievement Award with Jorge Rivera López. In late 2009, a tribute in her honor was held by the Northern Region of the Argentine Society of Writers, in which the Mayor of San Isidro presented a poetry anthology and designated <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>with</b> Bence's name.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1919, a fire gutted Waller Hall, {{the home}} of the library. The school rebuilt the {{interior}} of <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>with</b> construction beginning in February 1920. The library was moved to {{the second floor of the}} rebuilt structure and reopened in December 1920. At that time William E. Kirk was the librarian and the facility had a capacity of 100 people. By 1922 the collection had grown to 16,000 volumes, and F. G. Franklin served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall {{was built}} in the mid-15th century, and in the early 16th century the {{entrance}} porch and oriel room was added to {{the eastern side of the}} hall, and the great parlour and little parlour to the south of <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>with</b> bedrooms above. Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755, tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair. In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range 'had lately been destroyed and a farm house built on the site', (this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} floor is <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>with</b> a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the kitchen is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Isma'il Pasha {{also saw the}} return of royal {{patronage}} to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'yida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive {{when his father was}} deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, also aligning the southeastern facade of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>with</b> the street behind it, and remodeling several other areas of the mosque. Abbas II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new riwaq. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (initially formed under French occupation), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>with</b> Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

25|$|The Courtyard of the Favourites (Gözdeler / Mabeyn Taşlığı ve Dairesi) {{forms the}} last section of the Harem and overlooks a large pool and the Boxwood Garden (Şimşirlik Bahçesi). The {{courtyard}} was expanded in the 18th century {{by the addition of}} the Interval (Mabeyn) and Favourites (İkballer) apartments. The apartment of the Sultan's Favourite Consort along with the Golden Road (Altın Yol) and the Mabeyn section at the ground floor also included <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>with</b> the Mirrors. This was the space where Abül Hamid I lived with his harem. The wooden apartment is decorated in the rococo style.|$|E
25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the {{re-entrant}} angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted chambers are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>with</b> its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E

25|$|In 1460, Sir Thomas {{built the}} great Old Hall in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Gainsborough Old Hall {{was not only}} their home, but also a {{demonstration}} of their wealth and importance. Sir Thomas was a great benefactor to Newark Church and also {{the founder of the}} Chantry and Alms House at Gainsborough. In 1470, the manor was attacked by Sir Robert Welles over a clash about lands, status, and honour, but it was not severely damaged. It was in 1484 that Sir Thomas entertained King Richard III in his hall. Today, <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>with</b> its elaborate timber roof survives as well as the kitchen—possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England. The Hall is over five hundred years old {{and one of the best}} preserved medieval manor houses in England.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} records of presentations of movies was at Druids Hall in Redruth. In 1904, the Imperial Radioscope Company visited <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>with</b> their {{animated}} pictures. In 1910 Druids Hall was converted into the Jenkin's Picturedrome and operated by Mr William Henry Jenkin. Excited audiences filled the hall and marvelled as moving images of Pearl White, Rudolph Valentino and later Charlie Chaplin flickered across the screen. The cinema had its own orchestra, which started in 1918. Parts of the building (which was converted to a bingo hall in 1954, and burnt down in 1984) still stand today in Penryn Street, and {{the interior of the}} ruins now house St Rumon's Gardens. A rival cinema, officially called the Electric Picture Palace but known locally as The Egg Pit (so called because the owner supplied eggs for the London market) set up in nearby Foundry Row in the late 1900s. This cinema closed in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Sheldon is {{a senior}} {{theoretical}} physicist at Caltech and shared an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). However, Sheldon now lives across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>with</b> his fiancée Amy, in the former apartment of Leonard's wife Penny. He is a former child prodigy with genius level IQ, but displays an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm in other people, although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic behavior and {{a general lack of}} humility or empathy. He also lacks toleration. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and asexuality, co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these traits.|$|E
