5|$|In April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the SWT units would be fitted with new <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> provided by Vossloh Kiepe. As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated camshaft and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 traction motors. The new equipment consists of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is needed as the replacement traction motors are AC rather than DC.|$|E

25|$|The Victorian Railways E {{class was}} {{a class of}} {{electric}} locomotive that ran on the Victorian Railways from 1923 until 1984. Introduced shortly after the electrification of the suburban rail system in Melbourne, Australia, {{and based on the}} same electrical and <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> as Melbourne's early suburban electric multiple unit fleet, they provided power for suburban goods services and shunting for six decades.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 1980s New Deal plan {{to reinvigorate}} country {{passenger}} services, {{it was decided to}} rebuild the B class with new <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> as the A class. The rebuild contract was let in January 1983 to Clyde Engineering, Rosewater, with the first unit entering service in May 1984. The project was abandoned in mid 1985 after rising costs due to structural fatigue, with the eleventh and final rebuild delivered in August 1985.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen {{units are}} to be reintroduced on London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour {{services}} by South Western Railway in December 2018. These 18 units will be refurbished before their use on this service. South Western Railway has awarded Kiepe Electric UK the contract to undertake the £45m refurbishment. Work will include replacing the life-expired DC <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> with an AC package incorporating IGBT technology from Kiepe Electric Düsseldorf. New brake controls from Knorr-Bremse Rail Vehicle Systems will permit regenerative braking.|$|E

25|$|The B-class trams {{were first}} {{introduced}} to Melbourne in 1984 {{with the first}} prototype B1-class trams, the second being built in 1985. As of 2016, one is currently in regular service. The B-class trams used the same <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> as the Z3 and A-class trams, and were built for the light rail lines. They were originally built with movable steps to allow railway platform and street level boarding, but this concept was later abandoned, with low-floor platform built at the converted light rail stations.|$|E
25|$|When the {{signalling}} on the Central line needed replacement by {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided to}} bring forward the replacement of the 1962 Stock, due at about the time as the replacement of the 1959 Stock. The signalling was to be replaced with an updated version of the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system used on the Victoria line, the line traction supply boosted and new trains built. Prototype trains were built with two double and two single doors hung on the outside of each carriage of the train, and with electronic <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> that gave regenerative and rheostatic braking.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the NXEA franchise, Angel Trains {{opted to}} use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a {{test-bed}} unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new <b>traction</b> <b>equipment.</b> The DC motors, traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new AC motors, and 3-phase converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. Because AC motors are more reliable than DC ones and require significantly less maintenance, this should potentially bring significant cost savings. The work has the potential to extend the life of the Class 317 by up to 20 years. Angel Trains and Bombardier will evaluate the performance of the unit compared to a conventional Class 317.|$|E
50|$|Previously an English Electric Co site, and {{originally}} The Dick Kerr Works from 1901, GEC Traction occupied West Works (11 {{acres on}} the west side of Strand Road) from 1968.

25|$|Central line – The Central {{line was}} the first line to be modernized in the 1990s, with 85 new 1992-stock trains and a new {{automatic}} signalling system installed to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line runs 34 trains per hour {{for half an hour}} in the morning peak but is unable to operate more frequently {{because of a lack of}} additional trains. The 85 existing 1992-stock trains are the most unreliable on the London Underground as they are equipped with the first generation of solid state direct current thyristor control <b>traction</b> <b>equipment.</b> The trains often break down, have to be withdrawn from service at short notice and at times are not available when required, leading to gaps in service at peak times. Although relatively modern and well within their design life, the trains need work in the medium term to ensure the continued reliability of the traction control equipment and maintain fleet serviceability until renewal, which is expected between 2028 and 2032. Major work is to be undertaken on the fleet to ensure their continued reliability with brakes, traction control systems, doors, automatic control systems being repaired or replaced among other components. The Central line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new more up-to-date automatic signalling system. The line is predicted to run 36 trains per hour, a 25% increase compared to the present service of 34 trains for busiest 30 minutes in the morning and evening peaks and the 27–30 train per hour service for the rest of the peak.|$|E
500|$|A {{manufacturing}} {{defect in the}} new <b>traction</b> <b>equipment</b> has caused at least three explosions in service.

500|$|The NSB El 17 is a {{class of}} twelve {{electric}} locomotives built by Thyssen-Henschel and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The class was built in two batches, the first delivered in 1982 and numbered 2221–2226, and the second delivered in 1987 and numbered 2227–2232. The traction system of the El 17 {{was based on the}} DB Class 120 of Germany (BBC, AEG and Siemens) and were among the first in the world to feature three-phase asynchronous motors. The units were ordered to be used on the intercity Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines, but were plagued with technical faults (overheating <b>traction</b> <b>equipment,</b> transient voltages, etc.). The unreliability and lack of sufficient power forced NSB to instead use them in the regional Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. With the delivery of the El 18, the first series was retired or used as shunters. The second series has been used on the Flåm Line since 1998.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1998, the {{division}} {{of what had been}} the old Smit Slikkerveer was split into two smaller but focussed business units, HMA Power Systems and Traxis BV.

40|$|The {{diagnostics}} {{of mechanical}} components operating in transient conditions {{is still an}} open issue, in both research and industrial field. Indeed, the signal processing techniques developed to analyse stationary data are not applicable or are affected by a loss of effectiveness when applied to signal acquired in transient conditions. In this paper, a suitable and original signal processing tool (named EEMED), {{which can be used}} for mechanical component diagnostics in whatever operating condition and noise level, is developed exploiting some data-adaptive techniques such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) and the analytical approach of the Hilbert transform. The proposed tool is able to supply diagnostic information on the basis of experimental vibrations measured in transient conditions. The tool has been originally developed in order to detect localized faults on bearings installed in high speed train <b>traction</b> <b>equipments</b> and it is more effective to detect a fault in non-stationary conditions than signal processing tools based on spectral kurtosis or envelope analysis, which represent until now the landmark for bearings diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{traction}} (as intermediate technology) {{has been}} widely spread since a long time throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. There are considerable differences in level of development and types of the technology as well as differences between {{the areas in which}} it has been introduced. Animal <b>traction</b> <b>equipments</b> are used in agricultural operations (i. e. plowing, leveling, seeding, harvesting, and crop threshing), as well as for transportation (i. e. animal carts). In the last three decades, animal traction technology has been adopted in different rural development projects in Sudan, as an intermediate alternative to the very traditional and modern technologies. The idea mainly aimed at introducing simple, efficient, low–cost appropriate technology to increase the agricultural productivity, and the cultivated area as well as to promote off-farm activities in the rural areas. This study was conducted to investigate the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the intermediate technology which is introduced as a main component of the Nuba Mountains Rural Development Project. To meet the objective of the study a field survey was conducted in the Nuba Mountains area to collect the primary data from a stratified random sample of 296 farmers through personal interviews using a questionnaire. Also complementary qualitative primary data was collected through group discussion and informal interviews with traditional leaders, farmers and agricultural extension agents and observation...|$|R

2500|$|Between 1940 and 1948, {{domestic}} {{steam locomotive}} sales declined from 30 {{percent of the}} market to 2 percent. By 1949, there was no demand for steam locomotives. Baldwin's attempts to adapt to the changed market for road locomotives had been unsuccessful; the reliability of their offerings was unsatisfactory, epitomized by notorious failures such as their [...] "Centipede" [...] Diesel locomotives and their steam turbine-electric locomotives, which proved to be money pits unsuited for their intended service. [...] In July 1948 Westinghouse Electric, which had teamed with Baldwin to build diesel and electric locomotives and wanted to keep their main customer in the rail industry afloat, purchased 500,000 shares, or 21 percent, of Baldwin stock, which made Westinghouse Baldwin's largest shareholder. Baldwin used the money to cover various debts. Westinghouse vice president Marvin W. Smith became Baldwin's president in May 1949. In a move to diversify into the construction equipment market, Baldwin merged with Lima-Hamilton on December 4, 1950, to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. However, Lima-Hamilton's locomotive technology was unused after the merger and market share continued to dwindle. By January, 1952 Baldwin closed its factory in Rochelle, Il. and consolidated Whitcomb production at Eddystone. In 1953 Westinghouse discontinued building electrical <b>traction</b> <b>equipment,</b> so Baldwin was forced to reconfigure their drive systems based on General Electric equipment. [...] In 1954, during which time they were being virtually shut out of the Diesel market, Baldwin delivered one steam turbine-electric locomotive to the Norfolk and Western railroad, which proved unsatisfactory in service.|$|E
