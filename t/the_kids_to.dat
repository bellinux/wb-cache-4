When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States.

25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> try their sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E

[...] A reviewer of The Trades website called it [...] "an entertaining read that manages to serve several purposes in one concise novel" [...] and found the characters [...] "unusual yet likable", but felt that [...] "the disappointing bit of this novel is that the solutions always arrive through a series of disconnected events that just lead <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> think in certain ways."

500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] Sciannamea called [...] "the transformation of Michael's indifference over <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around" [...] as the [...] "most interesting aspect of the episode". He also called Dwight and Michael's sing-along near the end [...] "the single funniest moment of the season".|$|E
500|$|There are {{two types}} of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the Road show. The LIVE! show is {{performed}} {{at the front of the}} stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday ("I say Happy, you say Birthday..."). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members. The Road show is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the kids that participated. Chuck E. comes out every hour on the half hour (12:30, 1:30, etc.).

It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, loved the episode. They described it as [...] "A brilliant episode, underlining everything that The Simpsons is about. Homer hates church, Marge wants <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> see Homer as an example, and everyone pulls together in the end. Good stuff, and if God really is like that, he's a groovy kind of guy." [...] In 2012, HitFix's Alan Sepinwall cited the episode as his favorite of the show, writing that it [...] "captures everything that was and is great about the series: social satire, extraordinary quotability ('This Things I Believe'), a good family story, and an innate sweetness in spite of Homer's outsized antics." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com released a list of the Top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking Benjamin Franklin and Jimi Hendrix's air hockey game, a scene from the episode, at #83.

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, [...] "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!" [...] He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.|$|E

Ray collects his children, steals a car and drives to Mary Ann's home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning, he discovers that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food while surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City, Paris, Washington, D.C., and London, and have force shields to protect them from human weapons. They also explain that the Martians travelled to Earth within the lightning, as a guise to enter the Tripods. Ray decides to take <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> Boston to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon the stolen car after a mob takes it by force. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between U.S. Marines and the aliens, Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight; he lets Robbie go with the Marines, who are overwhelmed, thus making Ray presume Robbie died during the attack. While escaping, Ray and Rachel are offered shelter by a paramedic, Harlan Ogilvy, who presumes that the aliens had buried their technology on Earth millions of years ago and has delusions that they can fight against the aliens themselves by observing their operations, as they are right next to their camp.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E
