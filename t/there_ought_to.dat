5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be a political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

25|$|But {{since many}} persons are {{disturbed}} by questions concerning {{what is called}} in Latin substantia, but in Greek ousia, that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be no mention {{of any of these}} at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding.|$|E
25|$|The Nyaya school, {{one of six}} {{orthodox}} {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy, states {{that one of the}} proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is {{the same as that of}} Vedanta.|$|E

Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one.

500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E

With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{had earlier}} downplayed Germany's guilt in {{starting}} {{the war by}} calling for [...] "peace without victory", but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty's treatment of Germany.

It was this last point that led the Inter-Service Recognition Committee to decide, in June 1942, to establish its own publication (A lesser point was the saving of purchasing large numbers of copies of The Aeroplane Spotter).|$|E
