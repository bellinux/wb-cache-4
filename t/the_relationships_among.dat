These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Delton Hanson {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study of}} <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> populations of Oryzomys {{on the basis of}} data from three genes—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2). The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O.couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. The marsh rice rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris, O. p. coloratus, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. planirostris were all included. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of the marsh rice rat as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh rice rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations of the marsh rice rat be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the Mississippi–Alabama–Tennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.|$|E

It also determines the moderating role of emotional intelligence in predicting this relationship. Three hypotheses are generated for the study i. e., two hypotheses are to measure <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> transformational leadership style and decision making styles whereas third hypothesis is to assess the moderating effect of emotional intelligence. Questionnaire method is used to collect data from 113 respondents. Regression analysis is utilized to study <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> transformational leadership style and decision making styles and step-wise regression analysis is used to study moderating effect of emotional intelligence. The study found that transformational leadership style strongly predicts rational and dependant decision making styles and weakly predict intuitive and spontaneous decision making styles while no association founds with avoidant decision making styles. Present research also found that emotional intelligence moderates <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> transformational leadership style and decision making styles...|$|R

In 1892, to allow the general public an opportunity to observe these relationships, Geddes opened a “sociological laboratory” called the Outlook Tower that documented and visualized the regional landscape.

25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> eutherian mammals {{has experienced a}} virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics.|$|E

25|$|The 'core Asparagales', {{comprising}} Amaryllidaceae {{sensu lato}} and Asparagaceae sensu lato, are a strongly supported clade, as are clades {{for each of}} the families. Relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear, particularly within the Asparagaceae sensu lato. Stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize, and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past, so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified. Thus <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> subfamilies shown above, based on APWeb , is somewhat uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} passerine families and <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together {{on the basis of}} morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of convergent evolution, not a close genetic relationship. For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia; those of Australia; and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining Passeriformes.|$|E
25|$|Benson et al. (2012) {{found the}} {{traditional}} Pliosauroidea to be paraphyletic {{in relation to}} Plesiosauroidea. Rhomaleosauridae {{was found to be}} outside Neoplesiosauria, but still within Plesiosauria. The early Carnian pistosaur Bobosaurus was found to be one step more advanced than Augustasaurus in relation to the Plesiosauria and therefore it represented by definition the basalmost known plesiosaur. This analysis focused on basal plesiosaurs and therefore only one derived pliosaurid and one cryptoclidian were included, while elasmosaurids weren't included at all. A more detailed analysis published by both Benson and Druckenmiller in 2014 was not able to resolve <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> the lineages at the base of Plesiosauria.|$|E

25|$|Bifrenaria has {{traditionally}} been classified in subtribe Bifrenariinae of tribe Maxillarieae (Epidendroideae), however, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> the several genera within this tribe are not well defined and changes are expected in the upcoming years. The genus closest to Bifrenaria is Rudolfiella. Other related genera are Teuscheria, Guanchezia, Hylaeorchis and Horvatia, {{in addition to the}} more distant Scuticaria and Xylobium. The unification of subtribes Lycastinae, Maxillariinae and Bifrenariinae has recently been suggested. However, there is no consensus on the path to be followed. Contrary to what was previously thought, the relationship among Bifrenaria and all these genera from Central America seems to indicate a primitive origin of Bifrenaria in Central America and its posterior dissemination towards the Southeast of Brazil, where it found fertile grounds to its more recent evolution.|$|E
