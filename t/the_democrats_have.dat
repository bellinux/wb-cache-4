5|$|The Indiana House of Representatives {{consists}} of 100 members elected to two-year terms. The Speaker of the House for the 2015–2016 term is Representative Brian C. Bosma. In 2015, the House of Representatives has a Republican majority of 70 seats, while <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> 30 seats. The House offices {{are located in}} the east wing of {{the second floor of the}} Indiana Statehouse and the House chambers are on the third floor.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> {{held the}} {{governorship}} since 1993, having {{won the last}} six gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold seven of the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans hold only two statewide offices, State Auditor and State Treasurer.|$|E
25|$|At {{the state}} level it is descended from the New Liberal Movement (New LM) of Robin Millhouse, who held the Democrats' only lower house seats, Mitcham and its {{successor}} seat Waite. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> suffered internal problems and leadership scuffles since 1997. The 2007 federal election saw 65.79% of Democrat preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader at the election was Sandra Kanck.|$|E

50|$|Far-right {{groups such}} as Stop the Islamisation of Norway (SIAN) and the Norwegian Defence League (NDL), as well as <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>had</b> {{reportedly}} witnessed a boom in their memberships and interest by mid-August, with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> party <b>having</b> signed up around one hundred new members, and the NDL around three hundred.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> {{the most}} {{registered}} {{voters in the}} county, but {{the large number of}} Republican-leaning independents means Republicans win more county-wide elections than in other mostly-suburban counties in Maryland. However Democrats are the dominant party in Annapolis city elections. In the 2016 presidential election Anne Arundel County voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 6,016 votes. It {{was the first time that}} the county had supported a Democrat for president since 1964.|$|E
25|$|The County Legislature and its {{previous}} {{board of supervisors}} were long dominated by the Republican Party. However, since the late 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> closed the gap. During 2008 and 2009 the legislature was evenly split between 10 Republicans, 10 Democrats and 1 Independence Party member. In 2009, the legislature had its first Democratic chairman elected when {{one member of the}} Republican caucus voted alongside the 10 Democratic members to elect Roxanne Donnery (D)-Highlands/Woodbury to the post. At the November 2009 election, several Democratic incumbents were defeated. As of the convening of the legislature on January 1, 2012, there are 12 Republicans, 8 Democrats and 1 Independence member.|$|E
25|$|The Senate was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party {{for much of the}} 20th century. Since World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> only controlled the upper house twice. The first time came in 1965, after the 1964 Presidential Election only for them to lose it in special elections that year. The second time again came to power following the 2008 elections on the coattails of the victory of President Barack Obama. In mid-2009, dissatisfaction by some Democrats in the State Senate along with billionaire Tom Golisano, over the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith resulted in 2 Democratic Senators joining with the entire Republican caucus to install Senator Dean Skelos as Majority Leader and Temporary President. Over the month of June and July the Senate was mired in a leadership crisis that ended with the breakaway Democrats rejoining the caucus in late July. The Democrats maintained their majority throughout the remainder of the 2009–2010 session. Following state elections in 2010, Republicans were able to gain the two seats necessary to again reclaim the majority.|$|E

500|$|As Voorhis {{served his}} fifth {{term in the}} House, local Republicans searched for a {{candidate}} capable of defeating him. Richard Nixon answered the call. Nixon, who {{was still in the}} Navy when approached, wrote of Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted. But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches that tell what we want to do, not what <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> failed to do...

500|$|The victors in the 1857 state {{legislative}} campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor William B. Campbell {{wrote to his}} uncle, [...] "The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect {{a majority in the}} legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson." [...] The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature. Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond Whig newspaper referring to him as [...] "the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{was already}} {{arranging}} to research Voorhis's record {{and to meet}} with Republican leaders in Washington, including House Minority Leader (and future Speaker) Joseph W. Martin, Jr. [...] The newly minted candidate wrote to Day regarding Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted. But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches which tell {{what we want to}} do, not what <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> failed to do... I'm really hopped up over this deal, and I believe we can win." [...] However, [...] "" [...] Republicans deemed Nixon's campaign hopeless. [...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of the}} Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, we have nothing to worry about now." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Barron {{expressed}} his disaffection from the Democratic Party, {{disappointed by the}} large number of cross-endorsements Bloomberg received from Democrats.

[...] He told the Amsterdam News, [...] "Black folks need to consider a mass exodus from the Democratic Party and build a new party of their own, because <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> turned their backs on them on too many occasions. We should not give any party blind loyalty and support. Instead, we should really form a grassroots, Black-agenda-based third-party option." ...|$|E

The chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed that while the actions were [...] "inappropriate, intrusive, and burdensome," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> often experienced similar treatment. Republicans noted that 83% of the groups being held up by the IRS were right-leaning; and the Subcommittee Minority staff, which did not join the Majority staff report, filed a dissenting report entitled, “IRS Targeting Tea Party Groups.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> made strong {{gains in}} the past years with winning two gubernatorial races in a row, regaining control of the Virginia Senate, and electing Democrat Jim Webb to the U.S. Senate in the Democratic wave of the 2006 {{midterms}} over incumbent Republican George Allen. Democrats {{have been able to}} make such gains in Virginia {{due in large part to}} the ever-expanding Northern Virginia, particularly the suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C. [...] Historically, this area had been strongly Republican. [...] However, in recent years it has been dominated by white liberals who tend to vote Democratic. It was, ultimately, this rapid demographic change that provided a huge new influx of Democratic voters to Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> {{also had}} a candy desk since at least 1985. A rolltop desk located on the front wall, {{belonging}} to the United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary, is also filled with sweets. This tradition began [...] "sometime later" [...] than the better known candy desk; Hershey Kisses were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small caramels. Candy for this desk is paid for through a [...] "candy fund" [...] to which senators {{who would like to}} partake of the desk's contents contribute. Until he left the Senate in 2015, Jay Rockefeller was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the Historian of the United States Senate does not know much about it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{composition}} of the Senate was affected by the decision in 1987 as to which Senators received a long term, with Labor and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> voting to reject the alternate [...] "recount" [...] method that had been unanimously recommended by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform in 1983, and facilitated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Thus the Labor government, with only 32 seats, needed 7 additional votes to achieve the majority necessary to pass legislation. Because <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> got 2 additional long vacancies in 1987, in South Australia and New South Wales, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> a total of 8 seats from 1990 and thus continued to hold the balance of power, even after Janet Powell resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 1992.|$|R

2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I think a lot of <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1980, {{geographically}} the Republican [...] "base" [...] ("red states") is {{strongest in}} the South, the Midwest, and Mountain West. While it is weakest on the West Coast and Northeast, {{this has not}} always been the case; historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party with Vermont and Maine being the only two states to vote against Franklin Roosevelt all four times. In the Northeast, Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania continue to have a considerable Republican presence. The Midwest has been roughly balanced since 1854, with Illinois becoming more Democratic and liberal because of the city of Chicago (see below) and Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin more Republican since 1990. Ohio, Missouri and Indiana all trend Republican. Since the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> dominated most central cities, while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of suburbs.|$|E
60|$|The want of {{this close}} {{connection}} with Congress and the President's ministers {{has been so}} much felt that it has been found necessary to create a medium of communication. This has been done by a system which has now become a recognized part of the machinery of the government, but which is, I believe, founded on no regularly organized authority; at any rate, no provision is made for it in the Constitution, nor, as far as I am aware, has it been established by any special enactment or written rule. Nevertheless, I believe I am justified in saying that it has become a recognized link in the system of government adopted by the United States. In each House standing committees are named, to which are delegated the special consideration of certain affairs of State. There are, for instance, Committees of Foreign Affairs, of Finance, the Judiciary Committee, and others of a similar nature. To these committees are referred all questions which come before the House bearing on the special subject to which each is devoted. Questions of taxation are referred to the Finance Committee before they are discussed in the House; and the House, when it goes into such discussion, has before it the report of the committee. In this way very much of the work of the legislature is done by branches of each House, and by selected men whose time and intellects are devoted to special subjects. It is easy to see that much time and useless debate may be thus saved; and I am disposed to believe that this system of committees has worked efficiently and beneficially. The mode of selection of the members has been so contrived as to give to each political party that amount of preponderance in each committee which such party holds in the House. If <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> in the Senate a majority, it would be within their power to vote none but Democrats into the Committee on Finance; but this would be manifestly unjust to the Republican party, and the injustice would itself frustrate the object of the party in power; therefore the Democrats simply vote to themselves a majority in each committee, keeping to themselves as great a preponderance in the committee as they have in the whole House, and arranging also that the chairman of the committee shall belong to their own party. By these committees the chief legislative measures of the country are originated and inaugurated, as they are with us by the ministers of the Crown; and the chairman of each committee is supposed to have a certain amicable relation with that minister who presides over the office with which his committee is connected. Mr. Sumner is at present chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he is presumed to be in connection with Mr. Seward, who, as Secretary of State, has the management of the foreign relations of the government.|$|E
