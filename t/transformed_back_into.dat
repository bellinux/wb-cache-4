5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E

Gobiodon histrio {{is one of}} the very few species that can change sex in both ways. It has been shown that when two Gobiodon historio females, used to be males, are on the same coral reef, one of them <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a male goby.|$|E
25|$|Information {{security}} uses cryptography {{to transform}} usable information {{into a form}} that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> its original usable form by an authorized user, who possesses the cryptographic key, {{through the process of}} decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.|$|E
25|$|The 21 past Dark Ones, led by Nimue, {{bring the}} {{residents}} {{to the lake}} that will {{take them to the}} Underworld, and act as a barrier to keep them from escaping. Hook appears to help Nimue carry out the plan as Emma is left to watch. Regina then reminds Hook that he is unable to destroy Emma's family because he has changed as a person, and urges him to choose what kind of person he wants to be. Emma attempts to stop the Dark Ones from sacrificing her family, but Nimue starts choking Emma, despite being unable to kill her, to keep her from interfering. As Hook watches, he realizes the truth behind what Regina said, and uses Excalibur to absorb all of the darkness from Nimue and the Dark Ones into himself, which also traps all of the past Dark Ones inside Excalibur. Hook then asks Emma to kill him to destroy the Darkness, in order to allow him to die as a hero. A sad, crying Emma goes through with his wishes and kills Hook with Excalibur, which kills all of the previous Dark Ones. As Hook dies, his neck wound from Excalibur returns, and Emma is <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her normal self, with Excalibur disintegrating afterwards.|$|E

40|$|The Maximum Noise Fractions (MNF) {{transformation}} {{is used as}} a restoration tool in a 512 512 subscene of a 63 channel spectral dataset recorded over the Pyrite Belt in Southern Spain with the Geophysical Environmental Research Imaging Spectrometer (GERIS). The data obtained from such a scanning device are very useful in e. g. mineral exploration and environmental surveillance. Following the transformation from the original image space into the MNF space, a Fourier transformation of the MNFs (which are ordered by signal-tonoise ratio) will show more and more noise content. Also, the strong striping in primarily the visual bands of the scanner will be very conspicuous in the Fourier domain of only a few MNFs. We automatically detect the peaks in the Fourier spectra representing this striping, and if so desired we replace them by an iterated local mean value. <b>Transforming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the MNF space by the inverse Fourier transformation gives restored MNFs and <b>transforming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the original image space gives restored original bands. If we want to remove salt-and-pepper noise also, we can replace the noise-only MNFs by their mean value before <b>transforming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the original image space. This noise removal is very important alon...|$|R
2500|$|Hera {{is known}} for her jealousy; even Zeus, who is known to fear nothing, feared her tantrums. Zeus {{fell in love with}} Hera but she refused his first {{marriage}} proposal. Zeus then preyed on her empathy for animals and other beings, created a thunderstorm and transformed himself into a little cuckoo. [...] As a cuckoo, Zeus pretended to be in distress outside her window. [...] Hera, feeling pity towards the bird brought it inside and held it to her breast to warm it. Zeus then <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> himself and took advantage of her. Hera, ashamed of being exploited, agreed to marriage with Zeus. All of nature burst into bloom for their wedding and many gifts were exchanged.|$|E

[...] Txamsem, who could transform into anything, and often took the form of a human or bird, turned himself into a pine needle and was consumed by the daughter of the Chief who guarded daylight. [...] She then gave birth to him as a baby and the baby cried incessantly to play with daylight. [...] As soon as it was given to the baby in the form of a playful ball, he <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Raven and flew away with it.

2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died {{all he could do}} was live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as he is about to kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is <b>transformed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma hugs her with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight {{restoration}} in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not happy about that idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E

50|$|In {{the series}} Marvel Zombies, the Hulk has been {{infected}} with a virus {{which makes him}} into an undead zombie (he is actually infected by the zombie Fantastic Four). Although he still retains his strength and invulnerability, he no longer heals, is losing weight because of his now-deteriorating tissue, does not feel pain and now craves human flesh. The zombie Hulk's transformations are physically controlled purely by his appetite — after feeding, he <b>transforms</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Banner, {{who is also a}} zombie, until the hunger returns. When Hulk first <b>transforms</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Banner, his stomach starts to burst. He is directly responsible for killing the Silver Surfer by biting off his head.
