After marching through Belgium and Luxembourg, the brigade reached the German frontier on 25 November 1918 and subsequently crossed over into Germany on 1 December 1918. On 10 December 1918, the 4th Marine Brigade headquartered at Heddesdorf where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> the task of controlling the area around Coblenz.|$|E

5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the II Scouting Group, {{and participated in}} an {{abortive}} fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days}} of the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned,</b> they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Hauptmann Hans von Hahn's I./Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) was {{transferred}} from the Eastern Front to Germany for rest and re-supply. In November 1941, it {{was transferred}} to the northern Netherlands and on 15 January 1942 re-designated II./JG 1 in Katwijk. The group had been involved in the Battle of France and the Eastern Front campaigns as I./JG 3, and had 421 kills to its name by September 1941.

5|$|The G- and H-class destroyers were a {{group of}} 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Six {{additional}} ships being built for the Brazilian Navy when World War II began in 1939 were purchased by the British and named the Havant class. The design was a major export success with other ships built for the Argentine and Royal Hellenic Navies. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Mediterranean Fleet upon completion and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39.|$|E
5|$|The Special Engineer Detachment (SED) was {{activated}} in October 1943 {{as part of}} the 9812th Technical Service Unit. It {{was made}} up of men with technical skills or advanced education, and was mostly drawn from the defunct Army Specialized Training Program. War Department policy forbade giving deferments from the draft to men under 22, so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the SED. It reached a peak strength of 1,823 men in August 1945. SED personnel worked in all areas of the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E

The Regiment's experiences during the 1990s demonstrated that four Chinooks were not sufficient to meet the ADF's needs, leading to an order for two newly-built CH-47Ds in 1998. These helicopters were delivered in 2001, and designated A15-201 and A15-202.|$|E

5|$|When the 3rd Infantry {{landed at}} Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a {{division}} runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì.

5|$|After Maine and Missouri entered service, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the North Atlantic Fleet, while Ohio, {{built on}} the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent {{to serve as the}} {{flagship}} of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri, but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, Ohio returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.|$|E

5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991. With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} {{twenty-three years}} male peasants were drafted {{to serve in the}} {{military}}, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍) was a standing army composed of paid career soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} ships' careers, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to {{the main}} Italian fleet, where they were {{frequently}} occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on Naples. In 1895, Partenope joined a squadron that visited Great Britain, and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete {{in an attempt to}} defuse tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Euridice took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was a reaction to the Greco-Turkish War that had broken out that year. Between 1906 and 1908, Partenope was converted into a minelayer, and Minerva underwent a similar conversion in 19091910. Two ships, Calatafimi and Euridice, were discarded in early 1907.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were {{seized by the}} Germans where they were known as the L.T.M.35 until January 1940. In German service, they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Panzer Battalion (Panzerabteilung) 65 (39) of the 1st Light (leichte) Division and the independent Panzer-Regiment 11 (81) where they participated in the Invasion of Poland. 77 of these were lost during the campaign, mostly due to mechanical breakdowns, but only 7 of these were irreparable. From 1940 on, {{there had not been}} any spare parts available and tanks had to be completely rebuilt to remain operational.|$|E
5|$|Kingsbury was {{originally}} {{assigned to the}} 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, but requested a transfer to the 2/14th Infantry Battalion to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted {{on the same day}} at a different recruitment centre. The pair undertook basic training at Puckapunyal, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to the same section (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training. After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.|$|E
