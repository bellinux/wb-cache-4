25|$|With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They {{invaded the}} New York S.H.I.E.L.D. {{headquarters}} and captured the Thing. They then invaded the Baxter Building, battled <b>the</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>and</b> Nick Fury, and used Doctor Doom's time machine to bring Deathlok from his alternate future. Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted {{assassination of the}} U.S. President, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the Fantastic Four and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza. Fixer created the living machine-intelligence Computrex, which was destroyed by the Micronauts who then defeated Fixer and Mentallo.|$|E

25|$|The {{short story}} collection, La Cosa e altri racconti (<b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>and</b> Other Stories), was {{dedicated}} to Carmen Llera, his new companion (forty-five years his junior), whom he married in 1986. In 1984, Moravia {{was elected to the}} European Parliament as member from the Italian Communist Party. His experiences at Strasbourg, which ended in 1988, are recounted in Il Diario Europeo (The European Diary). In 1985 he won the title of European Personality. Moravia was a perennial contender to the Nobel Prize in Literature, having been nominated 13 times between 1949 and 1965. In September 1990, Alberto Moravia was found dead in the bathroom of his Lungotevere apartment, in Rome. In that year, Bompani published his autobiography, Vita di Moravia (Life of Moravia).|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the second}} film adaptation, Fantastic Four {{directed}} by Tim Story, {{was released by}} 20th Century Fox. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it earned US$155 million in North America and $330 million worldwide. The sequel, , directed by Story and written by Don Payne, was released in 2007. Despite mixed-to-negative reviews, the sequel earned $132 million in North America {{and a total of}} $330.6 million worldwide. Both films feature Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Susan Storm / Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm / <b>The</b> <b>Thing,</b> <b>and</b> Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom / Dr. Doom. Stan Lee makes cameo appearances as the mailman Willie Lumpkin in the first film and as himself in the second film.|$|E

500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more I was listening to <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> learning the song, I realized it set itself {{up to be a}} duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E

500|$|By the {{classical}} period, physical punishment {{had been abandoned}} for manifest theft and Gaius records merely four-times damages, introduced by the praetor. This meant, somewhat strangely, that a praetorian action could be more serious than a civil action, which was unusual. [...] Gaius also elaborates slightly on what constitutes manifest theft. He says that most jurists believed it extended to being caught {{in the place of}} the theft with <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> no further. [...] Julian (jurist), Ulpian, and Justinian all described it as including the thief who was still carrying the thing to its intended hiding place. There may have been a maximum time limit on manifest theft of this type, but it is unclear how long it was. The general rules for furtum were almost fully developed by {{the classical}} period and few significant changes were made during and after it.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Ice filmed {{a role in}} {{the film}} That's My Boy (released in 2012). In the film, Ice portrayed an exaggerated version of himself, called Uncle Vanny. He also worked with Andy Samberg in the movie and while shooting, Ice collaborated both with Samberg and Sandler musically. In August, Ice {{performed}} at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was officially announced that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. His sixth studio album, WTF, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice's return to Electronica, with songs like [...] "Turn It Up", [...] "Rock Star Party", [...] "Nightmare Disco" [...] and [...] "Cadillac Ninjas". On the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice was quoted saying [...] "It's like techno hip-hop. European. I live a lot in Europe, and when I'm over there I get way into the techno stuff and I get into new music. So I thought I'd make a record of it. I did <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a lot of}} fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest to bring an action. If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a pledgee, usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The unsecured creditor could not. Those obliged by contract to return <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered his thing, retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if the thing was stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> {{went in and}} I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{was mixed}} {{in less than}} half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he {{minimized}} the sound of Nolan's drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: [...] "It's too easy for it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had other places to be, so rather than split, they rushed <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> if that wasn't enough they took it to the crappy mastering lab that Mercury had put them in." [...] Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren [...] "fucked up the mix" [...] on New York Dolls, adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album's recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders' typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument, giving listeners the impression that [...] " [...] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones {{described}} the episode's stand-off between Mulder and Scully as [...] "an extremely tense moment of paranoia." [...] A New York Daily News review called the episode [...] "potent and creepy", {{and said that}} its plot [...] "was worthy of honorary passage into The Twilight Zone". Matt Haigh called it [...] "an extremely absorbing and thrilling episode" [...] on the Den of Geek website, noting its debt to <b>The</b> <b>Thing,</b> <b>and</b> Juliette Harrisson called [...] "Ice" [...] the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the first season. On the TV Squad blog, Anna Johns called it [...] "a spectacular episode" [...] with an [...] "excellent" [...] opening. UGO Networks called the episode's worms among the series' best [...] "Monsters-of-the-Week" [...] {{and the cause of}} [...] "much pointed-guns aggression". In Tor.com, Meghan Deans compared the scene where Mulder and Scully inspect each other for infection to a similar scene in [...] "Pilot"; in [...] "Ice", both characters were equally vulnerable and (unlike the pilot scene) Scully was not portrayed as [...] "an idiot". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode five out of five stars. They called it [...] "the most influential episode ever made", noting that the series reprised its formula several times during its run. Shearman felt that although their script was derivative, Morgan and Wong created [...] "a pivotal story" [...] by combining crucial themes from The Thing with a [...] "well rounded" [...] cast of characters.|$|E

500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>and</b> I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
