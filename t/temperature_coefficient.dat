5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient).</b> For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient,</b> typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{increase}} in sun intensity enhances the output {{power of the}} solar cells, {{but at the same}} time the rise of cell temperature affects its electrical performance negatively. The present authors have made a comparative study on <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> at various irradiances of multicrystalline solar cells made from the standard Siemens process and from material produced by a metallurgical route – the Elkem Solar Silicon (ESS®) process. Such <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured while exposed to various irradiance levels are essential to build a better understanding and prediction of field performance of solar cells manufactured from various feedstock types. In the current experiment, the current-voltages characteristics are measured for all solar cells by exposing them to an AM 1. 5 spectrum from a AAA sun simulator in order to calculate the <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Electroluminescence (EL) images in forward bias mode are also provided. It was observed that ESS™ solar cells show significantly better <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> for current, efficiency and fill factor compared to similar cells from polysilicon at all incident irradiances. Such better <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> have also been reported previously from field measurements [1]...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{brings out}} {{results of a}} {{measurement}} campaign aiming to determine the <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of synthetic quartz elastic constants at liquid helium temperature. The method {{is based on the}} relationship between the resonance frequencies of a quartz acoustic cavity and the elastic constants of the material. The <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the elastic constants are extracted from experimental frequency-temperature data collected from a set of resonators of various cut angles, because of the anisotropy of quartz, measured on the very useful cryogenic range [4 K - 15 K]. The knowledge of these <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> would allow to further design either quartz temperature sensors or conversely frequency-temperature compensated quartz cuts. With extremely low losses, lower than $ 10 ^{- 9 }$ for the best ones, key applications of such devices are ultra-low loss mechanical systems used in many research areas including frequency control and fundamental measurements. The Eulerian formalism is used in this study to identify the <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|Inherent safety. LFTR designs use {{a strong}} {{negative}} <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of reactivity to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The {{first is that}} thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the graphite moderator, that usually causes a positive contribution to the <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The third effect {{has to do with}} thermal expansion of the fuel. If the fuel overheats, it expands considerably, which, due to the liquid nature of the fuel, will push fuel out of the active core region. In a small (e.g. the MSRE test reactor) or well moderated core this reduces the reactivity. However, in a large, under-moderated core (e.g. the ORNL MSBR design), less fuel salt means better moderation and thus more reactivity and an undesirable positive <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the power integrated circuit technology, polysilicon resistors {{have been widely used}} not only in traditional CMOS circuits, but also in the high voltage applications. However, there have been few detailed reports about the polysilicon resistors’ characteristics, like voltage and <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> and breakdown behaviors which are critical parameters of high voltage applications. In this study, we experimentally find that the resistance of the polysilicon resistor with a relatively low doping concentration shows negative voltage and <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients,</b> while that of the polysilicon resistor with a high doping concentration has positive voltage and <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Moreover, from the experimental results of breakdown voltages of the polysilicon resistors, it could be deduced that the breakdown of polysilicon resistors is thermally rather than electrically induced.

25|$|Capacitance {{of ceramic}} {{capacitors}} varies with temperature. The different dielectrics {{of the many}} capacitor types show great differences in temperature dependence.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the application class qualification for the film/foil version of PP film capacitors, the standard IEC/EN 60384-13 specifies three “stability classes”.

The method is based on Simulated Annealing, a well-known optimization algorithm. The algorithm converges toward a set of optimized <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the stiffness constants which are used to perform accurate simulations up to at least 800 °C. In the second part, a deeper analysis of the algorithm outputs demonstrates some of its strengths but also some of its main limitations.
