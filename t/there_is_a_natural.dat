5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take a short break or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E

25|$|So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{construction}} inside NFU of {{the cumulative}} hierarchy of sets which internalizes the natural {{construction of a}} model of NFU in Zermelo-style set theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{geometric}} {{perspective on}} graph colorings by observing that, as an assignment of natural numbers to each vertex, a graph coloring is a vector in the integer lattice.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that if an}} orbifold {{chart on}} a {{contractible}} open subset corresponds to a group Γ, then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> local homomorphism of Γ into the orbifold fundamental group.|$|E
50|$|Besides, North Kazakhstan region <b>was</b> <b>a</b> unique area in Kazakhstan with <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{decline in}} {{population}}; however, since 2008, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> population increase.|$|R

60|$|Satan {{could easily}} {{account for all}} the {{difficulties}} of the Theory, and tell us whether, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> necessity of the Deluge, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not the like necessity and <b>natural</b> tendency to <b>a</b> Conflagration at last.|$|R
25|$|The lotus pond is an {{important}} feature in the Korean garden. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> stream, often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure of watching the water. Terraced flower beds are a common feature in traditional Korean gardens.|$|E
25|$|The set of all {{possible}} equivalence classes of X by ~, denoted , is the quotient set of X by ~. If X is a topological space, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> way of transforming X/~ into a topological space; see quotient space for the details.|$|E
25|$|The line above {{illustrates}} the principle: note that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> pause after 'hondum' {{and that the}} first stressed syllable after that pause begins with the same sound as a stressed line from the first half-line (the first halfline is called the a-verse {{and the second is}} the b-verse).|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s {{to early}} 1970s Scotland {{experienced}} a gradual increase in population, however from 1974 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> decrease in population, with both {{an excess of}} deaths over births and of emigration over immigration - particularly {{to the rest of}} the United Kingdom.|$|R
6000|$|Wolsey was {{far from}} being a cruel man, and besides, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{antagonism}} between him and the old nobility, and he liked and valued his fool, to whom he turned, saying, [...] "And what stake hast thou in this, sirrah?

25|$|The Rottweiler has a {{reasonably}} good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when working cattle uses a very intimidating charge. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When working cattle, it may use its body and shoulders {{and for this}} reason should be used on horned stock with caution.|$|E
25|$|In several senses <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{fit between}} human {{security}} concepts and humanitarian principles. The {{concern with the}} protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value {{as well as of}} human security. In this sense it shares human security’s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.|$|E
25|$|A group {{automorphism}} {{is a group}} isomorphism from a {{group to}} itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group G <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> group homomorphism G → Aut(G) whose image is the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms and whose kernel {{is the center of}} G. Thus, if G has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{evidence}} of Aristotle's having thought <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> law {{comes from the}} Rhetoric, where Aristotle notes that, aside from the [...] "particular" [...] laws that each people has set up for itself, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "common" [...] law that is according to nature. Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles: ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{committee}} {{rejected the}} idea that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> limit to the demand on the NHS. Instead they argued that the [...] "acceptable" [...] level of performance would rise indefinitely: [...] "The advance of medical science continually places new demands on the Service, and the standards expected by the public also continue to rise." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{ordering}} on the ordinals, {{which is}} itself a well-ordering. Given any ordinal α, one can consider the set of all ordinals less than α. This set {{turns out to have}} ordinal number α. This observation is used for a different way of introducing the ordinals, in which an ordinal is equated with the set of all smaller ordinals. This form of ordinal number is thus a canonical representative of the earlier form of equivalence class.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{continuous}} {{functions are}} the natural maps on topological spaces and smooth functions are the natural maps on differentiable manifolds, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> class of functions on an algebraic set, called regular functions or polynomial functions. A regular function on an algebraic set V contained in An is the restriction to V {{of a regular}} function on An. For an algebraic set defined {{on the field of}} the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even analytic.|$|E
25|$|In both cases, {{the cells}} of the {{partition}} of X are the equivalence classes of X by ~. Since each element of X belongs to a unique cell of any partition of X, and since each cell of the partition is identical to an equivalence class of X by ~, each element of X belongs to a unique equivalence class of X by ~. Thus <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> bijection between the set of all possible equivalence relations on X and the set of all partitions of X.|$|E

Three {{of the group}} present, including the ‘stag’ himself, had been students at Hatfield and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> draw {{to stay in the}} college. As you can imagine <b>there</b> <b>was</b> plenty of reminiscing! We of course all reflected on the opportunities provided by the University itself...|$|R
5000|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> preradical <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subfunctor of the {{identity}} functor {{in the category of}} left modules over a ring with identity. The class of all preradicals over R-mod is denoted by R-pr. <b>Theres</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> order in R-pr given by, for any two preradicals [...] and , , if for any left R-module M, [...] With this order R-pr becomes a big lattice.|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} allegedly {{carried out}} by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century saw young infants raised without human interaction {{in an attempt to}} determine if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> language that they might demonstrate once their voices matured. It is claimed he was seeking to discover what language would have been imparted unto Adam and Eve by God.|$|R
25|$|In {{some common}} posets {{such as the}} face lattice of a convex polytope <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> grading by dimension, which if used as rank {{function}} would give the minimal element, the empty face, rank –1. In such cases it might be convenient to bend the definition stated above by adjoining the value –1 to the set of values allowed for the rank function. Allowing arbitrary integers as rank would however give a fundamentally different notion; for instance {{the existence of a}} minimal element would no longer be assured.|$|E
25|$|This {{projection}} has {{the structure}} of a principal G-bundle where G is the associated classical group of degree k. Take the real case for concreteness. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> right action of O(k) on V'k(Rn) which rotates a k-frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive. The orbits of this action are precisely the orthonormal k-frames spanning a given k-dimensional subspace; that is, they are the fibers of the map p. Similar arguments hold in the complex and quaternionic cases.|$|E
25|$|During {{the past}} few decades, the Oceano Dunes have been {{involved}} with an ongoing series of environmental debates regarding the reduced air quality found in the receiving towns downwind of the dune system. Physical effects by the dust aerosols are indicated by accounts of homeowners claiming discomfort in breathing during times of high dust concentration, and air quality measurements. The San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District has been researching the reduced air quality downwind of the SVRA since 1995, and has concluded that while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> component to the dust pollution, vehicular activity makes it worse.|$|E
60|$|Creede Halcrow, {{the brother}} of Caffal, was the major of the regiment--a cynical, saturnine man, between whom and Captain Madwell <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{antipathy}} which circumstances had nourished and strengthened to an active animosity. But for the restraining influence of their mutual relation to Caffal these two patriots would doubtless have endeavored to deprive their country of each other's services.|$|R
