40|$|In {{dealing with}} computable general {{equilibrium}} modelling, this thesis builds and runs a computable equilibrium (CGE) tax model for Italy, {{with the aim of}} policy analysis. It demonstrates in considerable detail the methodology to incorporate a fiscal extension to the national comparative-static {{computable general equilibrium}} model of Italy. The output is a model featuring a detailed modelling of a full range of direct and indirect taxes, enabling the evaluation of alternative proposal for tax reforms. Within the fiscal extension, a comprehensive Value-Added-Tax (VAT) framework has been developed, which accounts for weaknesses of the current European VAT system, such as the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and the taxation of the public bodies and the exemptions in the public interest. In addition, a special emphasis has been given to sectors national accounts, with detailed equations describing revenue and expenditure items. The contribution this thesis makes is to fill the existing gap in the Italian CGE literature, as the model is designed for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, intended to provide practical policy recommendation. In using the model for policy analysis, a static general equilibrium methodology for evaluating alternative industrial and fiscal reforms is presented. Two illustrative simulations are performed. First, the economic impact of the shutdown of the ILVA Taranto steel-plant is assessed, giving new insights on the Italian industrial policy. The top-down regional dimension, together with the multi-sectoral supply-demand interaction and the multi-production structure of the economy make the model especially well-suitable for the assessment of industrial policy, at national, sectoral and regional level. Simulation results show a negligible economic damage at national level, with changes in the macro variables driving sectoral results. At regional level, when direct and indirect effects on regional economic activities from the removal of the plant are taken into account, it is not always the case that Italian regions suffer from the removal of the ILVA plant. Second, in response to calls for a simplification of the current EU VAT system, and of the fiscal consolidation need faced by Italy, a redesign of the VAT system is considered. Using the developed VAT model, an equalising VAT rate reform is performed. The simulation suggests that a phase-broadening is desirable, as results show a welfare gain resulting from the implemented policy...|$|E

Accounting for carbon emission allowances [...] Chapter Three. Domestic <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> transactions [...] Chapter Four. International <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> transactions [...] Chapter Five. Conclusions. The economic arguments {{in support of the}} use <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> schemes as a mechanism to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions rely on the ability of the schemes to internalise the cost of the pollution externality through a price signal – the cost of an emission permit. Taxation has the potential to distort this price signal if {{emissions trading}} transactions are not subject to the same tax treatment across entities but, to date, the issue of the application <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> regimes to such transactions has received little academic consideration. The prospect of inconsistent tax treatment is heightened where emissions trading systems are linked internationally, allowing permits to flow between jurisdictions. This thesis systematically examines the direct (income) <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>trading</b> transactions in order to determine instances in practice where inconsistent tax outcomes may arise and makes recommendations for tax law design. The thesis builds up a picture <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> <b>taxation</b> through three layers. The first is the treatment of relevant transactions for financial accounting purposes. This is necessary given that many jurisdictions take accounting profits as the starting point in determining tax liability. The second element is domestic taxation and involves a detailed, comparative analysis of the domestic tax treatment <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> transactions in Australia and the United Kingdom. These jurisdictions are amenable to comparison given that the United Kingdom is representative of jurisdictions that apply ordinary tax rules to these transactions, whereas Australia has adopted specifically designed tax rules to address the unusual features of the transactions. The third element is international taxation, where this necessarily involves the application of both international tax rules found in domestic law and tax treaties. These rules are applied to six hypothetical trading transactions which could arise under linked trading schemes in order to systematically test the outcomes against the goal of inter-firm neutrality. For these purposes, the representative tax systems are again based on the Australia and United Kingdom models and the tax treaty network is assumed {{to be based on the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital.

In particular, the benefits for the developing country would be: (i) allowing domestic companies to raise capital by issuing bonds or stock to foreign investors, for lower finance costs; (ii) allowing domestic companies access to the global derivatives markets, which will enhance their risk management activity; and (iii) allowing nonresidents more access to the domestic capital markets, which would enhance the efficiency and liquidity of the markets...|$|R

We show that standard functional forms for demand severely and often unrealistically restrict the behavior of pass-through rates. We propose an Adjustable pass-through (Apt) class of demand functions that avoids these restrictions while yielding closed-form solutions to standard models. To illustrate the utility of this generalized demand form we show how to embed it in monopolistic competition. This allows us to apply it to canonical international trade models with heterogeneous firms and provide a natural case in which standard results on the competitive e↵ects <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> reverse. Incidence (viz. the division between consumers and firms <b>of</b> gains from <b>trade</b> and losses from <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> that <b>trade)</b> plays a central role in much economic analysis.

This model highlights the roles that discretionary tax measures and economic growth play in effecting the shift from the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> to the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> domestic transactions. The objective {{of this study is}} twofold: first, to develop an econometric method of estimating built-in tax elasticity, and, hence, isolating the revenue impact of discretionary tax measures from that of economic growth; and second, to apply this model to selected sub-Saharan Africa countries in order to highlight the contribution of discretionary actions taken by fiscal authorities to trends of tax effort and individual tax shares during the past two decades. The structural adjustment programs of developing countries use fiscal deficit reduction as one of the policy tools for achieving real economic growth with price stability and balance of payments viability. In dealing with this deficit within such a framework, projects need to be made of the additional revenues which can be mobilized within the existing tax system as gross domestic product (GDP) grows. These projections indicate the need to activate additional means of revenue generation, particularly politically difficult discretionary tax measures.

Ronald McKinnon describes some of the services performed by the market and distinguishes between money and credit. The distinction is elementary, but important because it is often neglected.

Dale Henderson and Douglas Waldo analyze the effect of putting reserve requirements on Euro-dollars. They show that, in a model with a single rate of interest and fixed exchange rates, reserve requirements on Euro-dollars reduce the variance of the money stock — demand deposits and currency — around its target value. With fluctuating exchange rates, the result is ambiguous.

Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> slave <b>trades</b> in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|R
