5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|The first Susan B. Anthony dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on December 13, 1978. First strikes at the Denver and San Francisco Mints {{followed}} on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively. Mint officials {{feared that the}} coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered {{the creation of a}} stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979. The dollars all bore a mint mark denoting <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' for the San Francisco Mint. The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' mint mark since the Jefferson nickel issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin. In 1980, the 'P' mint mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia.|$|E

Kapos {{were responsible for the}} prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E

5|$|Newark is New Jersey's {{largest and}} second-most racially diverse city (after {{neighboring}} Jersey City). It {{is divided into}} five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two major}} {{reproductive}} strategies of teleosts; semelparity and iteroparity. In the former, an individual breeds once after reaching maturity and then dies. This is because the physiological changes that come with reproduction eventually lead to death. Salmon of the genus Oncorhynchus are well known for this feature; they hatch in fresh water and then migrate to the sea for up to four years before travelling back to <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> birth where they spawn and die. Semelparity is also known to occur in some eels and smelts. The majority of teleost species have iteroparity, where mature individuals can breed multiple times during their lives.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E
