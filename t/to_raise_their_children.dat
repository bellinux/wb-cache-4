5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E

25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E

But Carlos wants <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and tells Ellen that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> {{would have a}} better future with him. Ellen agrees with Carlos but unfortunately, Leila vehemently opposes this idea. She resents raising her husband's illegitimate child so she plots a scheme to switch the child with someone else's.|$|R
25|$|In 1983, the {{majority}} of Japanese national students within Greater New York City attended U.S. schools. To have education in the Japanese language and Japanese literature, they attend the weekend classes offered by the Japanese Weekend School of New York. The parents who select the weekend school and local school combination often wish <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> as international and connected to foreign cultures, while parents choosing the Japanese day schools wish to raise them as typical Japanese children. As of 1988 over 30% of the New York City area parents of school age children selected the full-time NYJS instead of the weekend school and local school combination.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the {{tradition}} that {{the children of the}} imperial family should be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish women (as well as Native American and African American {{women in}} the Spanish colonies) were {{expected}} to behave {{in a manner that}} would promote the Spanish culture and uphold the standards of Catholicism. Women were typically limited to the following roles: nun, wife/housewife, and mother. Any other role was looked down upon as it defied the Crown and Spanish culture. In fact, Spanish women were expected to teach the Indigenous and African women how <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and take care of their family. Because familial endeavors were highly emphasized by the monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, women were encouraged to have children, raise a family, and secure Spanish ideals and Catholic customs.|$|E

50|$|Philippine Republic Act 8552, {{also known}} as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998, recognizes that {{children}} should grow up with their biological parents; however, should the efforts of biological parents <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> be insufficient, other members of the extended family may take on the responsibility of parenthood for the child. It is only when members of the extended family are not available that adoption by non-relatives is allowed to take place.|$|R

500|$|Joint legal custody grants parents joint {{decision-making}} {{rights for}} important {{decisions that affect}} their minor children. The parents jointly decide how <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in matters of schooling, spirituality, social events, sports religion, medical concerns, and other important decisions. Both parents have equal decision-making status where the welfare and safety of the children is concerned. This generally means that both parents must be involved for major legal matters concerning their children, but that ordinary [...] "day-to-day" [...] matters and issues are left to {{the discretion of the}} parent who is providing physical care for the children at the time the decision is made. [...] Also, with joint legal custody, both parents share the ability to access to their children's records, including educational records, health records, and other records.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court has {{previously}} held that citizens have certain fundamental rights {{upon which the}} government cannot infringe, unless the deprivation of that right is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. This doctrine, arising from the [...] "liberty clause" [...] of the Fourteenth Amendment, is known as substantive due process. The right to privacy {{was found to be}} fundamental under this doctrine, and a number of rights to choice came out of it, such as in Roe v. Wade, where the Court found a right to have an abortion and in Meyer v. Nebraska, where the court found a parental right <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> as they wish. In Griswold v. Connecticut the Court extended this doctrine to the right to procure contraception. Substantive due process was further expanded to encompass children with In re Gault establishing that children have a right to procedural due process when the state attempts to take custody of them.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while [...] "Top Notch" [...] features jazz elements and the vocalist's playful {{promise of a}} trip to Denny's for [...] "the most expensive dinner we can find". On [...] "Still a Man", he sings {{from the perspective of}} a man who was left by his wife <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it was all}} over, {{the female}} smiled at Boas, rubbing her belly and gestured upwards.

The female seemed {{relieved}} that their [...] "task" [...] was over, and Boas himself said that he felt angered by the situation, because he felt as though he had been little more than [...] "a good stallion" [...] for the humanoids.|$|R
50|$|Career {{counseling}} or career guidance includes {{a wide variety}} of professional activities which help people deal with career-related challenges.

2500|$|After the 1994 Republican {{sweep of}} Congress, Moynihan agreed that {{correction}} {{was needed for}} a welfare system that possibly encouraged women <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> without fathers: [...] "The Republicans are saying we have {{a hell of a}} problem, and we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} parents need <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to be moral and religious, but not fanatical. Parents are {{required}} to provide an education to their children, and children {{have a duty to}} obey their parents, which is seen as obeying God. [...] Shoghi Effendi stated that preserving family unity is of utmost importance, and Bahá'ís are counselled to balance their desire to serve the religion with their responsibilities as parents, spouses and children.|$|E
2500|$|Jews were {{prohibited}} from living or entering Norway by paragraph 2 (known as the Jewish Paragraph in Norway) of the 1814 Constitution, which originally read, [...] "The evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public {{religion of the}} State. Those inhabitants, who confess thereto, are bound <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to the same. Jesuits and monkish orders are not permitted. Jews are still {{prohibited from}} entry to the Realm." [...] In 1851 the last sentence was struck out. Monks were permitted in 1897, and Jesuits not before 1956.|$|E

[...] Some of his lectures were taped and sold at Islamic bookshops. He also called on Muslim mothers <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to be jihad soldiers {{by the age}} of 15.

2500|$|In the Constitution of Norway from 1814, a relic {{from the}} earlier anti-Catholic laws of Denmark-Norway, Paragraph 2 {{originally}} read: [...] "The Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State. Those inhabitants, who confess thereto, are bound <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to the same. Jesuits and monastic orders are not permitted. Jews are still prohibited from entry to the Realm." [...] Jews were first allowed into the Realm in 1851 after the famous Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland had campaigned for it. Monastic orders were permitted in 1897, but the ban on Jesuits was only lifted in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{treatise}} on education, Emile, or On Education (1762), he encouraged parents <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> on a vegetarian diet. He {{believed that the}} food of the culture a child was raised eating, {{played an important role}} in the character and disposition they would develop as adults. [...] "For however one tries to explain the practice, it is certain that great meat-eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men. This has been recognized at all times and in all places. The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men. All savages are cruel, and it is not their customs that tend in this direction; their cruelty is the result of their food." ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "best {{interests}} of the child" [...] doctrine is sometimes used in cases where non-parents, such as grandparents, ask a court to order non-parent visitation with a child. Some parents, usually {{those who are not}} awarded custody, say that using the [...] "best {{interests of}} the child" [...] doctrine in non-parent visitation cases fails to protect a fit parent's fundamental right <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> in the manner they see fit.

40|$|As {{this brief}} online essay observes, the {{litigation}} {{that produced the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 2013 decision in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl demonstrates why we are no closer to a definitive resolution {{of what to do}} when parents do not share assumptions about how <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> The case illustrates the national lack of agreement on what makes someone a parent. At the core of these differences is {{the question of how to}} align parental behavior with the promotion of the child’s interest in stable and secure relationships...|$|R
2500|$|Further themes {{pointed out}} by critics have {{included}} vengeance, solidarity, home, and redemption. In his review of Mad Max: Fury Road, film critic A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "The themes of vengeance and solidarity, the wide-open spaces and the kinetic, ground-level movement mark Fury Road as a western, and the filmmakers pay tribute to such masters of the genre as John Ford, Budd Boetticher and, not least, Chuck Jones, whose Road Runner cartoons are models of ingenuity and rigor." [...] Similar to the previous Mad Max films, home has been regarded as a central theme in Mad Max: Fury Road as it dominates the motivations of Max, Furiosa, and the Five Wives: his home was destroyed, she was taken from her home, and the wives are {{in search of a}} new home <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> The unity of these characters also harnesses a concern for family, a common theme within Miller's filmography. It also carries the theme of female empowerment.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{have speculated}} that Haywood had an affair and even a child with Richard Savage in the 1720s, in {{addition}} to a twenty-year open relationship with William Hatchett; he was suspected of being the father of her second child. However, later critics have called these speculations into question as too heavily influenced by Alexander Pope's famous illustration of her in The Dunciad and too little based upon hard facts (Pope depicted Haywood as a grotesque figure with two [...] "babes of love" [...] at her side, one by a poet and the other by a bookseller). [...] Other accounts from the period, however, suggest that her [...] "friends" [...] rejected Pope's scandalous depiction of her; they maintained that she had been deserted by her husband and left <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> alone. [...] In fact, and despite the popular belief that she was once a woman of ill repute, Haywood seems to have had no particular scandals attached her name whatsoever.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, Syrian Jews began {{escaping}} clandestinely, {{and supporters}} abroad helped smuggle Jews out of Syria. Syrian Jews already living abroad often bribed officials to help Jews escape. Judy Feld Carr, a Canadian-Jewish activist, helped smuggle 3,228 Jews out of Syria to Israel, the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Carr recalled that Syrian-Jewish parents were [...] "desperate" [...] {{to get their}} children out of the country. Those who were caught attempting to escape faced execution or forced labor. If an escape was successful, family members could be imprisoned and stripped of their property. Often {{with the help of}} smugglers, escapees attempted to sneak across the border into Lebanon or Turkey, where they were met and assisted by undercover Israeli agents or local Jewish communities. Most escapees were young and single men. Many single men decided to put off marriage until they escaped, as they wanted <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in freedom. As a result, the ratio of single men and women became heavily imbalanced, and Syrian Jewish women were often unable to find husbands. In 1977, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, as a gesture to US President Jimmy Carter, began allowing limited numbers of young women to leave the country, and some 300 left in total under this program.|$|E
