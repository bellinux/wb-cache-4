5|$|In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University {{rejected}} Wasson's {{theory and}} noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> was too vague {{to determine a}} description of Soma. In his 1976 survey, Hallucinogens and Culture, anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against {{the identification of the}} fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.|$|E
5|$|Koch himself {{believes}} that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of the poem was 9th century rather than 6th century, and Isaac, writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Linguist A. P. Nepokupnyj proposes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> {{source for}} Białystok is Yotvingian. Names with the -stok suffix {{as a second}} element of a hydronym are {{localized}} in the basin of the upper Narew.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, John Myhill {{introduced}} an automaton model today known as deterministic linear bounded automaton. In 1963, Peter S. Landweber proved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> accepted by deterministic LBAs are context-sensitive. In 1964, S.-Y. Kuroda introduced {{the more general}} model of (nondeterministic) linear bounded automata, noted that Landweber's proof also works for nondeterministic linear bounded automata, and showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> accepted by them are precisely <b>the</b> context-sensitive <b>languages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chinese records suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of Goguryeo, Buyeo, Eastern Okjeo, Dongye, Baekje and Silla were similar, while <b>the</b> Tungusic <b>languages</b> of Mohe and Yilou {{differed}} significantly.|$|R
40|$|Problem domains evolve, so {{it seems}} natural <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of problem solving need to evolve as well.

5|$|Meksi's {{work was}} {{important}} {{for the development of}} written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo-European root.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing that African American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming {{able to read the}} texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E

5000|$|Aptekar was {{a believer}} in Marr's [...] "Japhetic theory," [...] which held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kartvelian <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Caucasus area such as Georgian were related to <b>the</b> Semitic <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Middle East, in {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> school <b>that</b> held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> were Indo-European (one member being Arnold Chikobava). That grew into an ideological issue, with support for Japhetism being required for professional advancement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{generally}} accepted four branches of <b>the</b> Romance <b>languages</b> are Western Romance, Italo-Dalmatian, Sardinian and Eastern Romance. But {{there are other}} ways <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of Italo-Dalmatian can be classified in these branches: ...|$|R
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of the Bible {{should be}} demythologised to {{be compatible with}} naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick believed that demythologising the incarnation would {{make sense of the}} variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} {{a language that}} could work {{in a wide variety}} of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
50|$|Melville Jacobs (1939) says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> are {{as close}} as Dutch and German. They share {{more than half of}} their vocabulary, though this is not always obvious, and {{grammatical}} differences cause <b>the</b> two <b>languages</b> to look quite different.|$|R
2500|$|The Lhammas [...] {{exists in}} two versions, the shorter one {{being called the}} Lammasathen.

50|$|The Sjálvstyri (separatists) had {{national}} sentiment {{on their}} side. They regarded it as untenable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> official <b>language</b> could be other than <b>the</b> native <b>language.</b> <b>The</b> party program formulated a core demand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Faroese <b>language</b> should become <b>the</b> <b>language</b> {{of instruction in}} all subjects.

5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He {{believed that the}} work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there were beautiful scenes, but many feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{he points}} out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words {{was at the time}} recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the {{translator}} to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E
25|$|In her book, <b>The</b> Uralic <b>language</b> family: facts, myths, and statistics, {{linguist}} Angela Marcantonio argues {{against the}} existence of the Uralic family, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> are no more closely related to each other than they are to various other Eurasian languages.|$|R
50|$|Studies of <b>the</b> Sami <b>languages</b> of Norway, Sweden and Finland, {{conclude}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> {{have anywhere}} from 180 snow- and ice-related words {{and as many}} as 300 different words for types of snow, tracks in snow, and conditions of the use of snow.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> idea <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Americas {{are related}} {{goes back to}} the 19th century when early {{linguists}} such as Peter Stephen DuPonceau and Wilhelm von Humboldt noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Americas seemed to be very different from the better known European languages, yet seemingly also quite similar to each other. When studies of American Indian languages began in earnest in the early 20th century linguists quickly realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indigenous <b>languages</b> were in fact not all that similar, but had a diversity much greater than among <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of Europe. After a period of uncertainty about whether indigenous languages could be described and investigated by the methods applied to European <b>languages,</b> <b>the</b> first linguists began the daunting task of trying to classify <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Americas by using the comparative method.|$|R
5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E

50|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ngurmbur <b>language</b> isolate may belong to this group. In 2003, Nicholas Evans proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Macro-Gunwinyguan <b>languages</b> are (also) related to <b>the</b> Eastern Daly <b>languages.</b> However, none of these connections are accepted as established in Bowern 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} used in a {{different}} sense by the Soviet linguist Nicholas Marr, in his Japhetic theory, which was intended to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of <b>the</b> Caucasus formed part of a once-widespread pre-Indo-European language group.|$|R
50|$|Lhuyd {{noted the}} {{similarity}} between <b>the</b> two Celtic <b>language</b> families: Brythonic or P-Celtic (Breton, Cornish and Welsh); and Goidelic or Q-Celtic (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic). He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Brythonic <b>languages</b> originated in Gaul (France), and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Goidelic <b>languages</b> originated in <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula. Lhuyd concluded <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> had been of Celtic origin, the people who spoke those languages were Celts. From the 18th century, the peoples of Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts, and are regarded as the modern Celtic nations today.|$|R
25|$|Complicating the issue, Arthur Goldberg, {{one of the}} key drafters of {{the final}} {{language}} present in the resolution, pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> intentionally refers to both Jewish and Arab refugees.|$|E

Some linguists propose the so-called [...] "Buyeo languages" [...] family <b>that</b> includes <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje. Chinese records also suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> of Goguryeo, Buyeo, East Okjeo, and Gojoseon were similar, while Goguryeo language differed from that of Malgal (Mohe).|$|R
