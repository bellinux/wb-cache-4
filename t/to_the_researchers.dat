5|$|Tizard put his {{thoughts}} in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member for Research and Development. He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would only need to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E

One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming using lower stocking densities. Poultry producers routinely use nationally approved medications, such as antibiotics, in feed or drinking water, to treat disease or to prevent disease outbreaks. Some FDA-approved medications are also approved for improved feed utilization.|$|E
25|$|A recent Finnish {{study of}} more than 5,000 {{hospital}} staff found that those who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimaki et al., 2000). According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.|$|E

25|$|A 2007 {{survey to}} examine whether or not people who {{believed}} in evolution {{were more likely to}} support animal rights than creationists and believers in intelligent design found that this was largely the case – according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers,</b> the respondents who were strong Christian fundamentalists and believers in creationism were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were atheists or agnostic.|$|E
25|$|Project Alpha was an {{elaborate}} hoax {{that began in}} 1979 and ended with its deliberate disclosure in 1983. It was orchestrated by the stage magician and skeptic James Randi. It involved planting two fake psychics, Steve Shaw (now better known as Banachek) and Michael Edwards, into a parapsychology (PSI) research project at Washington University. Introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> during {{the initial stages of}} the program, the young men convinced the researchers that their psychic powers were real. With spoon bending demonstrated, the lab ran a long series of experiments to test the range of their abilities, involving everything from moving objects in sealed globes, to changing electronic clocks, to making images appear on unexposed film.|$|E

25|$|In these {{double-blind}} experiments, {{neither the}} participants nor the researchers know which participants {{belong to the}} control group, nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants were which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of preconceived notions or physical cues (e.g., the placebo effect, observer bias, experimenter's bias) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is {{a critical part of}} any double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> until the study is over.|$|E
25|$|Known {{instances}} of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce nucleons and particles on readily observable ballistic trajectories. In {{support of their}} claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a neutron flux of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detection of tritium. The classical branching ratio for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 watt of power, the production of 1012 neutrons per second, levels {{that would have been}} fatal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers.</b> In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported what they called the first scientific report of highly energetic neutrons, using CR-39 plastic radiation detectors, but the claims cannot be validated without a quantitative analysis of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the studio}} {{was set up}} to allow people {{in front of the camera}} to see {{themselves}} on monitors, and the videotapes were available to be watched by anyone, the two used the video to critique their own performance. They would deliberately fail on their first attempt at any given demonstration, and then use the video to find out what was visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> and what was not. They would then develop a technique that would not appear on video. Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of hand, so he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman. This was also a clear violation of one of Randi's caveats; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.|$|E

25|$|Beyond sex {{differences}} in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women’s underrepresentation in higher education, especially {{in the fields of}} natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the National Science Foundation shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis, which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers,</b> “emphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women’s own minds, making them vulnerable to stereotype threat”.|$|E

500|$|On her 122nd {{birthday}} on 21 February 1997, it {{was announced}} that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer Jean-Marie Robine, a co-author of a book about Mme Calment, reportedly said that this [...] "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive", while the New York Times reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month before her death. Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am Central European Time of unspecified causes. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers,</b> the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the rue Gambetta, and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to general skepticism among gynecologists, sexologists {{and other researchers}} that the G-spot exists, a team at King's College London in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective. They acquired the largest sample size of women to date – 1,800 – who are pairs of twins, {{and found that the}} twins did not report a similar G-spot in their questionnaires. The research, headed by Tim Spector, documents a 15-year study of the twins, identical and non-identical. Identical twins share genes, while non-identical pairs share 50% of theirs. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>researchers,</b> if one identical twin reported having a G-spot, it was more likely that the other would too, but this pattern did not materialize. Study co-author Andrea Burri believes: [...] "It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too." [...] She stated {{that one of the reasons}} for the research was to remove feelings of [...] "inadequacy or underachievement" [...] for women who feared they lacked a G-spot. Researcher Beverly Whipple dismissed the findings, commenting that twins have different sexual partners and techniques, and that the study did not properly account for lesbian or bisexual women.|$|E
