5000|$|Pivot topic {{sentences}} {{will come}} {{somewhere in the}} middle of a paragraph, and usually announce that the content will be changing in a different direction. These are often used when there are two differing opinions about something or when two [...] "experts" [...] are being quoted or referred to that may have a different opinion or approach to something. A paragraph may begin something like this: Kubler and Kessler have identified 5 stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And they have provided a detailed explanation of the symptoms and behaviors of each of these stages, so that those experiencing grief may identify which stage they are in at any given time and develop strategies with the help of their therapists, to move through those stages more effectively. Since their original work, however, a number of other psychologists have developed different models of the grieving process that call into question some of Kubler and Kessler’s contentions…. [...] (rest of paragraph to follow).The first part of this paragraph addresses Kubler and Kessler; the second part will obviously address another opinion. The <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> underlined, to show the pivot point in the paragraph. Pivot topic sentences will always have some clue word, such as [...] "yet," [...] "sometimes," [...] or [...] "however." ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} more than thirty years since Richard Braddock {{published}} the notable article in which he examined the manner that professional writers utilize topic sentences. He found in his corpus that expository paragraphs seldom began with topic sentences. Consequently, Braddock (1974) admonished teachers to stop instructing their students that most professional writers begin their paragraphs with topic sentences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to replicate Braddock’s study using a corpus made up of articles selected from a particular area of written discourse, American history. Braddock’s model, with a few exceptions, is used in the evaluation of this material. Braddock’s conclusion, that only 13 % of expository paragraphs begin with a topic sentence, has been widely cited to support the notion that teachers need to reassess the manner in which they teach reading and writing skills. Results of this study indicate that, in this corpus, a major <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> at the initial position of the respective discourse block unit in approximately two-thirds of the cases. Thus, certain conclusions which have been drawn from Braddock’s study need to be re-considered...|$|E
40|$|<b>Topic</b> <b>sentence</b> writing <b>is</b> an {{important}} component of academic writing. Through studying <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in Chinese students’ English essays, this research aims to find out the frequency and the placement of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences,</b> the wording within <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the relationship between <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and paragraph unity. In this research, 45 English essays written by Chinese students were collected from WECCL corpus and targeted <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> selected out afterwards. Depending on Wordsmith 3. 0, results related to <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> generated including the frequency, the placement, the wording of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the unity between <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and supporting sentences. Results show that Chinese students have a good awareness of writing <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and placing them at the beginning of paragraphs. However, Chinese students are not good at applying transitional phrases and expressing ideas objectively as academic writing requires. Moreover, paragraph unity in some Chinese students’ essays is poor. In addition, as a part of this empirical study, an interview about how to write <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> <b>was</b> conducted among ten Chinese students majoring in English in order to verify the results.

40|$|This study uses fMRI (functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging) {{to investigate the}} brain activity {{in a set of}} cortical areas in the task of main idea identification, when the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> presented in first versus in last position in a three-sentence paragraph. The participants were eight right-handed undergraduate students from Carnegie Mellon University, six male and 2 female, all native speakers of English. Each participant read twelve paragraphs, six in which the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> paragraph initial and six in which it was paragraph final, and each paragraph was presented word by word {{in the center of a}} screen, inside the scanner. The major finding of the current study is the differential response observed in the left and right hemispheres as to the location of the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> within the paragraph. The left temporal region showed greater activation when the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> in final position than in initial position. The right temporal region, on the other hand, was affected only by sentence type, showing a greater response to <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> than support sentences, regardless of their location within the paragraph. Este estudo utiliza a ressonância magnética funcional para investigar a atividade cerebral em áreas corticais durante a execução da tarefa de extração de idéias principais, quando a idéia principal é apresentada no início ou ao final de um parágrafo com três orações. Os participantes da pesquisa foram oito alunos de graduação da Universidade de Carnegie Mellon, todos destros, falantes nativos do inglês. Cada participante leu doze parágrafos, seis com a idéia principal no início e seis com a idéia principal no final do parágrafo, e cada parágrafo foi apresentado palavra por palavra, no centro de uma tela, dentro do aparelho de ressonância magnética. O maior achado do presente estudo refere-se à resposta diferenciada observada nos hemisférios direito e esquerdo. A região temporal esquerda mostrou maior atividade cerebral quando a idéia principal era apresentada em posição final do que em posição inicial.

Children were trained to find the main idea in one-and two-paragraph texts and took pre- and posttests in which they were asked to write the main ideas contained in one-, and six- to eight-paragraph texts. The main ideas contained in these texts either <b>were</b> explicitly stated (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> first or last) or <b>were</b> implicit (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> missing). Children's performance improved from pre- to posttest, although the effect of <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement <b>was</b> evident at both test times (performance on topic-sentence-first paragraphs was better than on topic-sentence-last paragraphs, which was, in turn, better than performance on topic-sentence-missing paragraphs).

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a {{semantic}} differentiation between the notions of <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> and discourse <b>topic.</b> <b>Sentence</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> conceived of {{as part of a}} semantic predication in the sense of Y. Kim's work. Discourse topic is defined, as in N. Asher's Segmented Discourse Representation Theory, as a discourse constituent that comprises the content of (part of) the larger discourse. The main body of the paper serves to investigate the intricate connection between the two types of topic. For restricting the context of investigation, a specific relation between discourse constituents, Elaboration, is chosen. If Elaboration holds between two discourse constituents, one of them can be identified as the explicit discourse topic with respect to the other one. Whereas an elaborating sentence - with or without a <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> - <b>is</b> used to infer a 'dimension' for extending the discourse topic, the role of the <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> if it occurs is to mark an 'index' for predication along that dimension. The interaction of elaborating <b>sentences</b> and their <b>topics</b> <b>is</b> modelled by means of channel theoretic devices. ...|$|R

The goals of the study are {{to find out how}} Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulates the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process, to identify the constraints experienced by the students when writing and how they coped with those problems. Over six months of conducting the research; field notes, transcribed interviews, and responses from questionnaire served as the data. The results showed that the Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulated the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process by conducting two parts: Complexors and Puzzles. Complexors gave the students hundreds of repetitions in basic writing skills. Puzzles guided the students through a set of writing patterns. When students were playing with Complexors, they worked in teams to orally create as many Complexor tasks as possible in a minute. Complexors are speed games designed to build oral fluency. Writing a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> enormously simplified because students could speak 20 <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in a row. When students were playing with Puzzles they worked individually or in teams, completing prewriting and writing tasks.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{speakers}} and writers use linguistic devices to signal a shift of topic in their discourse. The present paper considers the comprehension function of one of these segmentation markers, namely a temporal adverbial, by studying its role in a well-established boundary effect: Reading time for the first sentence of a new discourse unit is longer than reading time for the other sentences. In four experiments, participants read short narratives in which: a target <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> preceded by highly congruent sentences(topic continuity condition) or by weakly congruent <b>sentences</b> (<b>topic</b> shift condition). As predicted by the boundary hypothesis, <b>topic</b> shift <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> read more-slowly than <b>topic</b> continuous <b>sentences.</b> However. the boundary effect disappeared when the segmentation marker was inserted {{at the beginning of the}} <b>topic</b> shift <b>sentence</b> (Experiment 1), though not at its end (Experiment 2).

40|$|Good {{composition}} {{is the one}} which creates clear impression of unity (Vivian and Jackson, 1961 : 32). In addition, a good composition must be unified on two levels. First, it must have an overall unity that means each paragraph of the composition must {{be related to the}} thesis statement as the central idea which is stated in the introductory paragraph. Second, the individual support paragraphs (paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and so on) must also exhibit internal unity. It means that the supporting sentences of each paragraph must be related to its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> This study <b>is</b> intended to reveal how far the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala Catholic University can apply their knowledge in writing unified compositions. As they learn descriptive writing, the writer analyzes the unity as encountered in their descriptive compositions. The analysis covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To carry out this study, the writer took the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala University as the subjects of this study. The data were taken from their final test papers. As stated previously, the analysis of the data covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To analyze the unity in the paragraph, the writer identified the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> of each paragraph and evaluated the relationship between the supporting <b>sentences</b> and its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> while to analyze the unity in the whole composition, the writer identified the thesis statement of each composition and evaluated the relationship between each <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and its thesis statement. The analysis of unity in the paragraph showed that most paragraphs under study were disunified while the rest were unified. There were two factors that violated the unity in those paragraphs. They are the presence of more than one <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and the irrelevant relationship between some supporting <b>sentences</b> and the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> In addition, the analysis of the unity in the whole composition showed that all compositions under study were disunified. There were also some factors that made all compositions under study disunified. They are the absence of thesis statement as the central idea of the composition, the disunity in one or some or all paragraphs of the compositions, and finally, the irrelevant relationship between one or two <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the thesis statement. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that all students under study still found difficulties in creating unity in their compositions especially in writing composition with one thesis statement, in making all paragraphs of the composition unfied, and developing the thesis statement in several paragraphs which support the thesis statement itself. Concerning the result of this study, it is suggested that the teachers should train the students in forming thesis statements as the central idea of a composition as well as elaborate it into several <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> by making an outline of a composition. It is also suggested that the teachers should keep training the students to create unity in the paragraph since one or two or all paragraphs are disunfied in all students’ compositions under study...|$|R
