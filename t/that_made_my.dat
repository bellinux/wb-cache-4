500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{transfer}} negotiations {{which had}} been ongoing in the final months of the season, Kinkladze left Manchester City for Dutch club Ajax for £5 million. The move brought a reunion with Shota Arveladze, with whom he shared a house in Amsterdam. However, Kinkladze's spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful. He was originally signed {{as a replacement for}} Jari Litmanen, but Litmanen stayed at Ajax as his proposed move to Barcelona fell through. As a result, Kinkladze played in an unfamiliar left-wing position. His league debut for Ajax came in a 2–0 win against Willem II on 23 August 1998, but he made few starts. To compound matters, manager Morten Olsen was sacked early in the season, and a disagreement with replacement Jan Wouters resulted in Kinkladze losing his place in the team. [...] "I could have been Maradona and he wouldn't have changed the system to accommodate me", Kinkladze recalled later. [...] "I wasn't playing football and <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> life hell." [...] He immediately started to look elsewhere. Several English top-flight clubs showed interest in signing him, but were discouraged by work permit issues. His lack of regular playing time also resulted in him losing his place in the Georgian national team. Having failed to established himself in the first team and struggling with a succession of injuries, he made just 12 appearances for Ajax in his first season.|$|E
2500|$|Liberace {{began playing}} the piano at age four. While Sam took his {{children}} to concerts to further expose them to music, {{he was also a}} taskmaster demanding high standards from the children in both practice and performance. Liberace's prodigious talent was evident from his early years. By age seven, he was capable of memorizing difficult pieces. He studied the technique of the Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski. At age eight, he met Paderewski backstage after a concert at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee. [...] "I was intoxicated by the joy I got from the great virtuoso's playing. My dreams were filled with fantasies of following his footsteps…Inspired and fired with ambition, I began to practice with a fervor <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> previous interest in the piano look like neglect". Paderewski later became a family friend.|$|E

2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could {{to get the ball}} {{up to the plate and}} get it over, maybe even for a strike. But even <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> arm ache like a tooth was busting every time I threw. And the balls I was throwing never would fool anybody in the Negro leagues, not without a fast ball to go with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly {{felt that there}} was much about the album that should not work, including [...] "sickly-sweet vocals", [...] "theme-park-level arrangements" [...] and [...] "cheesy song choices". Despite this, she commented: [...] "When the Glee kids nail something—like a version of Van Halen's [...] "Jump" [...] <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> cheeks sore from smiling—the title of this joyful franchise could not be more apt." [...] Allmusic's Andrew Leahey observed that the soundtrack felt [...] "a bit rushed" [...] due to its release four weeks after Volume 1 and the fact it features songs from half as many episodes as the first album. He criticized: [...] "As before, this album sometimes strays away from choral arrangements and sounds more like a collection of karaoke recordings." [...] Overall, however, Leahey believed that returning fans would find the album enjoyable.|$|E
2500|$|Alexandra, {{the exiled}} Dowager Governess of South Wood, {{is the main}} {{antagonist}} of Wildwood. She is charming and beautiful, and vastly more sophisticated and civilized than her anarchic coyote soldiers she only recently domesticated. In spite of her ruthlessness and murderous intentions, she is a somewhat tragic figure as a grieving mother whose madness is somewhat explained {{by the loss of}} her child. Ellis said, of the illustration of Alexandra holding a knife over Mac, [...] "as a mom of a little kid, just drawing <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> blood run cold." [...] The action of Wildwood is driven by her plot to take revenge on everyone and everything in The Wood, in which she intends to use Prue's brother Mac as a blood sacrifice in a spell to control The Wood's Ivy, which will then grow out of control and consume every living thing in The Wood. The invasive threat of the magical ivy apocalypse that Alexandra plotted in the book is similar to the threat of an [...] "ivy desert" [...] monoculture from invasive English ivy (Hedera helix) in the real Forest Park.|$|E

2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
