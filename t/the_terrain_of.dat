5|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> {{a barrier}} island is {{determined}} by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland. A typical barrier island has a headland, a beach and surf zone, and a sand spit.|$|E
5|$|NY333 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with CR11 and CR24 in Risingville, an isolated hamlet within the Steuben County town of Thurston. It headed eastward, following Michigan Creek along {{the base of}} a valley surrounding the waterway. Due to <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the area, NY333 intersected only a handful of roads, one of which was Cranberry Lake Road (CR2), a north–south highway that met NY333 midway between the hamlets of Risingville and Thurston. The route continued onward, turning northeastward toward Thurston Pond and the small hamlet of Thurston at {{the eastern edge of the}} small lake. Here, NY333 curved back to the east as it met Savona–Thurston Road (CR12) in the western half of the community.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> South Florida is {{relatively}} and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the {{peninsula}} {{has much to}} do with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes {{the peninsula}} and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} country roads. Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys make up <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the initial northern {{sections of the}} Way before giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only practical way to reach the cemetery was by railway. William Cubitt decided that <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery, and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery. The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The rails, and in particular the sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E

5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as there were not enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in muskeg, a marshy soil type that {{is almost impossible to}} cross by foot. In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
5|$|In early 1953, the Việt Minh under Võ Nguyên Giáp {{commenced}} {{an invasion}} of Laos to exert additional pressure on Paris and on the French forces stationed in Indochina. In the area of Muong Khoua were the Việt Minh 308th, 312th and 316th divisions, whose long supply lines were maintained by a veritable army of 200,000 porters. The French command—headed then by Raoul Salan—ordered {{the establishment of a}} series of French outposts in northern Laos to resist the Việt Minh invading forces {{for as long as possible}} to buy time for the fortification of Luang Prabang and Vientiane, the capital cities of Laos. The King of Laos, Sisavang Vong, remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> northern Laos, and the local climate, isolated many of the outposts with a night-time fog known as crachin, thick jungle, a lack of roads, and steep terrain. Each outpost was given a certain number of days to withstand Việt Minh forces, including Muong Khoua which was issued orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days—until April 27.|$|E
5|$|The Huon Peninsula is {{situated}} along the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, and stretches from Lae {{in the south}} on the Huon Gulf to Sio in the north along the Vitiaz Strait. Along the coast, between these two points, numerous rivers and streams cut <b>the</b> <b>terrain.</b> <b>Of</b> these, the most prominent are the Song, Bumi and Mape Rivers. These waterways flow from the mountainous interior which is formed through the conglomeration of the Rawlinson Range in the south, with the Cromwell Mountains in the east. These meet in {{the centre of the}} peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif, which joins the Finisterre Range further west. Apart from a thin, flat coastal strip, {{at the time of the}} campaign, the area was thickly covered with dense jungle, through which very few tracks had been cut. The terrain was rugged and for the most part the tracks, until improved by engineers, were largely impassable to motor transport and as a result throughout the campaign a large amount of the Allied resupply effort was undertaken on foot.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the march, the loyalist forces faced {{problems}} such as desertions, lack of discipline, illness, food shortages, and poor navigation. The march included several river crossings, which were made difficult {{by the lack of}} bridges, swollen rivers due to rain, as well as bogged down wagons and cannons. It was particularly difficult for the VOC forces, who were unfamiliar with <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the Javanese interior. Hurdt wanted to stay in the Solo River valley, and to continue the campaign in the following year. Amangkurat preferred to keep marching, and his opinion prevailed. As the loyalist forces marched eastwards, the rebel forces avoided major battle, but fought in skirmishes, and continued to endanger the loyalists' foragers and stragglers. The loyalists scoured the countryside to collect food, causing panic among its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September7. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September11 about 800miles (1300km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, {{one of the most}} active single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andrés. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior.|$|E
