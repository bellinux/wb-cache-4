5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{case of this}} type occurs when a pronoun stands alone following the word than. Here the objective form is again predominant in informal usage (they <b>are</b> older <b>than</b> us), as would <b>be</b> expected if <b>than</b> <b>were</b> analyzed as a preposition. However traditionally <b>than</b> <b>is</b> considered a conjunction, and so in formal and grammatically careful English the pronoun often takes the form that would appear if <b>than</b> <b>were</b> followed by a clause: they <b>are</b> older <b>than</b> we (by analogy with ...<b>than</b> we <b>are),</b> but she likes him better than me (if the intended meaning is [...] "...than she likes me").|$|R
5|$|Gisa (also spelt Giso; died 1088) was Bishop of Wells from 1060 to 1088. A {{native of}} Lorraine, Gisa came to England as a {{chaplain}} to King Edward the Confessor. After his appointment to Wells, he travelled to Rome rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> consecrated by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As bishop, Gisa added buildings to his cathedral, introduced new saints to his diocese, and instituted {{the office of}} archdeacon in his diocese. After the Norman Conquest, Gisa {{took part in the}} consecration of Lanfranc, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and attended Lanfranc's church councils. His tomb in Wells Cathedral was opened in the 20th century and a cross was discovered in his tomb.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|Less than a {{week after}} the season's conclusion, backup quarterback Tyler Ferguson {{announced}} his plans to transfer from the university to somewhere he would have an opportunity to start, rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> Christian Hackenberg's backup for the remainder of his career. Later, it was announced that though he originally intended to transfer to Western Kentucky (WKU), at which Bobby Petrino was head coach; when Petrino accepted the head coaching position at Louisville, Ferguson changed his plans, and transferred there. In early December, it was reported that quarterbacks coach Charlie Fisher and linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden, the latter of whom was a holdover from the Joe Paterno era, departed, with speculation that they were forced out by Bill O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, {{to ensure that they}} would operate with a degree of autonomy rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the bishops}} in England {{did not want to}} be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford {{travelled}} to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so the charge is suspect.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E

5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E
5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> detained at Byzantion.|$|E

5|$|The group {{discovers that}} the generator's fuel {{reserves}} are near exhausted; when empty, the facility will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed {{to destroy the}} facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner open the doors, and Rick eventually convinces him {{to allow them to}} at least try to overcome the tragedy rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction. The surviving members return to their vehicles and set off away from the smoking husk of the CDC.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially {{within sight of the}} other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, {{when it became clear that}} his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E
5|$|When Australia {{committed}} {{forces to}} the Malayan Emergency in April 1950, Jones grouped the requisite RAAF assets under one overarching organisation, No. 90 (Composite) Wing, to ensure they would operate with some autonomy rather <b>than</b> <b>be</b> dispersed throughout other Allied services as had {{been the case in}} World War II, when Australian units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF. He also proposed that the officer commanding all Commonwealth air force units should be from the RAAF; this was agreed by the British Air Ministry, and the position later gave valuable experience to two future Chiefs of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshals Frederick Scherger and Val Hancock. Jones allocated No. 77 Squadron, then based in Japan as part of British Commonwealth Occupation Force, to the United Nations Command when the Korean War broke out. Prime Minister Menzies rang Jones at home on Saturday, 1 July 1950, requesting a squadron and the unit went into action the following day.|$|E
