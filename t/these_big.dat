5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that <b>these</b> <b>big</b> classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiencies}} of dye sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSCs) are boosted up to 12 % by NIR light harvesting dyes {{and with the}} usage of scattering layer in the device preparation. The importance of Titania scattering layers was studied {{as a part of}} this work. These scattering layers were prepared from two different grain-sizes (100 nm & 500 nm) for SQ 2 -NIR and N 3 -UV/Vis DSCs. The 100 nm grain-sized Titania paste was commercially supplied and 500 nm grain-sized Titania paste was prepared according to literature. The morphological and structural properties of <b>these</b> <b>bigger</b> grain-sized Titania layers were deliberated by using and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The influence of <b>these</b> <b>bigger</b> grain-sized Titania scattering layers in SQ 2 -NIR and N 3 -UV/Vis DSCs were expounded by using various electro-optical characterization techniques such as light I-V, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shown in Figure 1 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The importance of understanding the influence of <b>these</b> <b>bigger</b> grain-sized scattering Titania layers could pave a way for future design and optimizing of DSCs for increasing the amount of light harvesting...|$|R

25|$|In America {{the firm}} {{soil of the}} Plains allowed direct pulling with steam tractors, such as the big Case, Reeves or Sawyer-Massey {{breaking}} engines. Gang ploughs of up to fourteen bottoms were used. Often <b>these</b> <b>big</b> ploughs were used in regiments of engines, so that in a single field there might be ten steam tractors each drawing a plough. In this way hundreds of acres could be turned over in a day. Only steam engines {{had the power to}} draw the big units. When internal combustion engines appeared, they had neither the strength nor the ruggedness compared to the big steam tractors. Only by reducing the number of shares could the work be completed.|$|E

25|$|In 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were {{becoming}} the dominant draw, and {{the cities of}} the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring <b>these</b> <b>big</b> names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour {{of the city and}} asked him to pick his spot. The Giants were given the lease to the PCL San Francisco Seals digs while Candlestick Park was built for them.|$|E
25|$|Bonhomme Richard {{was about}} the same length as Alliance, and {{originally}} had almost the same armament, with a broadside of just over 200 pounds (91kg) from 18 guns, but Jones had been able to add six second-hand 18-pound guns, mounted {{in such a way that}} they could be rotated to fire through ports low down on either side, adding 108 pounds (49kg) of shot to a full broadside. In the event, though, <b>these</b> <b>big</b> guns only fired eight shots between them, because two of them quickly burst open under the strain, killing most of the people around them, so the remainder were abandoned. Serapis, one of the Royal Navy’s newest ships, also had 18-pound guns (10 on each side, contributing 180 pounds (82kg) to a total 22-gun broadside of around 280 pounds (130kg)) which were in good condition. Additionally, being designed as a warship, Serapis was more manoeuvrable than the Bonhomme Richard. By coincidence, due to desertions and the need to crew captured vessels, Bonhomme Richard’s crew had been reduced from around 400 to about the same as Serapis, 320.|$|E

500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't Look Any Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do <b>these</b> <b>big</b> boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, that is really effective." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it gives you an event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that <b>these</b> <b>big</b> Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into <b>these</b> <b>big</b> arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E

Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage. Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to [...] "give something back." [...] According to Bruce, [...] "We brought along <b>these</b> <b>big</b> beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea." [...] Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.|$|E

So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E

Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top: [...] "When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing <b>these</b> <b>big</b> silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something." [...] The video begins with a wide-angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly.

Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with <b>these</b> <b>big</b> action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
