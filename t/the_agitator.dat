25|$|While {{publisher}} of <b>The</b> <b>Agitator</b> at Home Fox {{became involved in}} two legal controversies. The first involved the sensational Los Angeles Times bombing of 1910, in which 21 people had been killed. Private detective William J. Burns sought the arrest of a former resident of Home Colony, David Caplin, and his associate Matt Schmidt {{in connection with the}} case, believing the two to have been conspirators. Burns established headquarters in Tacoma early in October 1911 and began staking out the house of Jay Fox and searching his mail, convinced that as editor of <b>The</b> <b>Agitator</b> he knew the whereabouts of the two fugitives.|$|E

50|$|On 25.6.1979, the Army {{along with}} 9 Magistrates took up {{positions}} round the CISF Lines {{in the early}} hours and called upon <b>the</b> <b>agitators</b> to give up charge of the Armory. In spite of giving repeated warnings by the authorities to give up charge of <b>the</b> Armory, <b>the</b> <b>agitators</b> did not give up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. <b>The</b> <b>agitators</b> started firing at 0320 hours at the Army. The Army returned the fire. The said exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the Army could spell out the violent retaliation of <b>the</b> <b>agitators.</b> <b>The</b> said violent exchange of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a result of firing by the CISF personnel.

Such details renewed speculation that Marta was signing works penned by Dan Rădulescu. The student-narrator takes part in the strike of 1932, where she meets recruiters for both the Romanian Communist Party and the fascist Iron Guard (including a glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>agitator</b> Bănică Dobre). The autofictional Rădulescu informs the reader that she prefers the Guard, but attends meetings of the far-left, during which communist activists imply that the difference between them and the fascists is a minor one.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{decided to}} leave Home Colony {{in favor of a}} new start in Chicago, where syndicalist leader William Z. Foster had moved in order to {{establish}} a new organization called the Syndicalist League of North America. Fox brought with him his publication <b>The</b> <b>Agitator,</b> previously produced at Home Colony, and renamed it The Syndicalist, making it the official organ of the new organization. The organization's total membership never exceeded 2,000 members, although it did manage to establish local groups in Kansas City, St. Louis, San Diego, Omaha, and in Chicago. The group attracted several important activists to its ranks, including Samuel Hammersmark and Foster's future son-in-law, Joseph Manley.|$|E

50|$|Pro-Telangana activists damaged 16 statues {{representing}} Telugu culture {{language on}} Tank Bund.

In conjunction with Struve he drew up the radical programme carried at the great Liberal meeting held at Offenburg on September 12, 1847 (entitled Thirteen Claims put forward by the People of Baden). In addition to the Offenburg programme, the Sturm petition of March 1, 1848, attempted to extort from the government the most far-reaching concessions. But it was in vain that on becoming a deputy Hecker endeavoured to carry out its impracticable provisions. He had to yield to the more moderate majority, but on this account was driven still further towards the Left. The proof lies in the new Offenburg demands of March 19, and in the resolution moved by Hecker in the preliminary Frankfurt Parliament that Germany should be declared a republic. But neither in Baden nor Frankfurt did he at any time gain his point.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid <b>the</b> <b>agitator,</b> connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

From a spent golden bullet, Bond tracks Scaramanga to Macau, where he sees Scaramanga's mistress collecting golden bullets at a casino. Bond follows her to Hong Kong, where he witnesses the murder of Gibson and the theft of the Solex agitator.

50|$|In the 1970s, Whirlpool {{developed}} a dual-action washing machine <b>agitator</b> that utilized <b>the</b> bottom {{portion of the}} shaft for the usual oscillating motion but added an upper sleeve {{that was designed to}} work as an auger. The auger propelled water and clothing downwards toward <b>the</b> <b>agitator's</b> oscillating vanes so as to produce more uniform scrubbing. Whirlpool secured three Canadian patents for this work. In the first patent, <b>the</b> dual <b>agitator</b> was powered by a drive shaft. A second patent (known as the '803 patent) substituted a clutch mechanism for the drive shaft. Both patent specifications described <b>the</b> <b>agitator's</b> vanes as being rigid.

The director of the party house (the last before the frontier) helps <b>the</b> four <b>agitators</b> and <b>the</b> young comrade in the obliteration of their true identities. They all put on masks in order to appear as Chinese. They are told to keep concealed that they are communist. Their mission must remain a secret. Should they be discovered, the authorities will attack the organization and the entire movement; not merely the lives of <b>the</b> four <b>agitators</b> and <b>the</b> young comrade will be put in danger. <b>The</b> <b>agitators</b> and <b>the</b> young comrade all agree to these conditions.|$|R

500|$|Scott Dalrymple, in {{his journal}} article on The Bread-Winners, argues, [...] "the brunt of Hay's ire seems aimed less toward these working men {{themselves}} than toward troublesome union organizers. Left to their own devices, Hay believes, most laborers are reasonable creatures". Hay biographers Howard L. Kushner and Anne H. Sherrill agree, writing that the author was attempting [...] "to expose {{the way in which}} this class, due to its ignorance, fell prey to the villainies of false social reformers". To Hay, unions were dangerous as they manipulate the uneducated worker; it was better for laborers to work out their pay and conditions individually with their employer, as Sleeny does with Matchin. In his journal article, Frederic Jaher notes that Offitt, a self-described reformer, [...] "is arrogant, tyrannical and self-righteous. Hay's message is clear: the established system needs no basic change; eliminate <b>the</b> <b>agitator</b> and harmony returns." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the radical}} rights that Fox fought for were {{documented}} in <b>The</b> <b>Agitator</b> and welcomed {{by the people of}} the colony.

[...] The ability of Fox to sway public opinion and feed the fire of anarchy was in part strengthened by his role as author and editor of Home’s newspaper <b>The</b> <b>Agitator.</b>|$|E

Seven weeks later he was arrested for violating a law that made it a misdemeanor to [...] "encourage or advocate disrespect for the law or any court or courts of justice." [...] The case went to trial in January 1912 and the jury found Fox guilty of the offense, but recommend a lenient punishment.

60|$|I {{understand}} the meeting whose resolutions I am considering {{to be in}} favor of suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies. Long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law and the Constitution sanction, this punishment. Must I shoot a simple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him to desert. This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I think that, in such a case, to silence <b>the</b> <b>agitator</b> and save the boy is not only constitutional, but withal a great mercy.|$|E
