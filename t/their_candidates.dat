5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state {{had more than one}} way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> in the informally segregated city.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic-Republicans in Congress held a nominating caucus {{and named}} Jefferson and Aaron Burr as their presidential choices. Jefferson at first {{declined}} the nomination, but he {{finally agreed to}} run a few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and Thomas Pinckney as <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> for president. The campaign, was, for the most part, unorganized and sporadic, confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets and political rallies; of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned.|$|E
5|$|With the Federalist Party {{was deeply}} split over his {{negotiations}} with France, {{and the opposition}} Democratic–Republicans enraged over the Alien and Sedition Acts, {{and the expansion of}} the military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in 1800. As in 1796, the Federalist members of Congress caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and Charles C. Pinckney. The Democratic–Republicans meanwhile nominated Jefferson and Burr, <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> in the previous election.|$|E

5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's ballot on charges that the Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's ballot access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's ballot. The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to report their nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E
5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist <b>their</b> <b>candidates.</b> The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, the Democrats {{selected}} Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor as <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> {{for governor}} and lieutenant governor, respectively. They faced a Whig (formerly National Republican) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead. Buckner was hurt by his extremely religious ideals, including opposition to handling mail on Sunday, {{and failed to}} garner the support {{of some of his}} own party's newspapers. Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin, but Morehead defeated Taylor, Breathitt's little-known running mate. Breathitt's election marked the first time a Democrat had ascended to the governorship of Kentucky. The election was marred by fraud, however. In Oldham County, the number of votes tallied represented 162.9% of the eligible voters in the county, and these votes broke two-to-one in favor of Breathitt. Most Kentuckians were more concerned about the upcoming presidential election, hoping Whig and native son Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson. Because of this, most of the other state offices went to Whig candidates.|$|E

50|$|Following Labour's {{declaration}} of former Pontefract MP Tom Smith as <b>their</b> <b>candidate,</b> the Communist Party of Great Britain declared unemployed Castleford engineer John William Malkin as <b>their</b> competing <b>candidate.</b> However, as the Communist Party {{was at the}} time opposed to the requirement of a £150 deposit, <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> was declared to be invalid and Labour's candidate was returned unopposed. Smith represented the constituency until he resigned his seat in 1947, triggering another by-election.|$|R
5|$|In May 1878, Weaver {{accepted}} the Greenback nomination for the House of Representatives in the 6th district. Although Weaver's political career up to then {{had been as}} a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Since the start of the Civil War, Democrats had been in the minority across Iowa; electoral fusion with Greenbackers represented their best chance to get <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> into office. Hard-money Democrats objected to the idea, but some were reassured when HenryH. Trimble, a prominent Bloomfield Democrat, assured them that if elected Weaver would align with House Democrats on all issues other than the money question. Democrats declined to endorse any candidate at the 6th district convention, but soft-money leaders in the party circulated their own slate of candidates that included Democrats and Greenbackers. The Greenback–Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, the six parties {{came to an}} {{agreement}} on forming a coalition government. The Katainen government will have 19 ministers with the portfolios divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers, while the Left Alliance, the Greens and the SPP would each have two ministers and the Christian Democrats would have one. The NCP, SDP, SPP and the Christian Democrats announced <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> for minister positions on 18 June, while the Left Alliance—with some of its notable members opposing joining the government—confirmed its participation in the government and its candidates for ministeral portfolios on its party council on 19 June. The Green League announced its ministers on 20 June. On 22 June, the parliament elected Katainen as prime minister {{by a vote of}} 118–72; two Left Alliance MPs voted against Katainen, for which they were formally reprimanded by the Left Alliance parliamentary group. President Tarja Halonen then formally inaugurated the government at the government palace in Helsinki the same afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 3, 1953, {{was the second}} held under the city charter of 1951 and represented the first test of the Democratic city government of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. In the 1951 election, the voters had elected a Democratic mayor {{for the first time}} in 67 years, breaking the Republican hold on political power in the city. They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with Democrats for district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, the voters had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to block it in the election for City Controller, Register of Wills, and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all <b>their</b> <b>candidates</b> citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once-powerful Philadelphia Republican machine.|$|E
5|$|Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 (1991) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that {{confirmed}} the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due {{to the death of}} H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select <b>their</b> <b>candidates.</b> John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties.|$|E
