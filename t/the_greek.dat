5|$|On October 27, 1914, after {{approval}} from the Great Powers, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> army re-entered the area. During <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> administration, and while the First World War continued, it had been agreed between Greece, Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue {{should be left to}} the future, after the war ended. After Venizelos' resignation in December however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and pre-determine the region's future by incorporating it formally within <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> elections and elected 16 representatives for <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.|$|E
5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> right and punched a hole in <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> line. On <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. <b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E

500|$|Repeatedly {{defeated}} in battle by <b>the</b> <b>Greeks,</b> and plagued by internal rebellions that hindered {{their ability to}} fight <b>the</b> <b>Greeks,</b> after 449 BC, Artaxerxes I and his successors instead adopted a policy of divide-and-rule. Avoiding fighting <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> themselves, <b>the</b> Persians instead attempted to set Athens against Sparta, regularly bribing politicians to achieve their aims. In this way, they ensured that <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> remained distracted by internal conflicts, and were unable to turn their attentions to Persia. There was no open conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> and Persia until 396 BC, when the Spartan king Agesilaus briefly invaded Asia Minor; as Plutarch points out, <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> were far too busy overseeing the destruction of their own power {{to fight against the}} [...] "barbarians".|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> {{army had}} taken up a {{position}} near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos River, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. <b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> line, which was about 2.5 miles in length, was thus secure on both flanks. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> line seems to have slanted north-eastwards across the plain in between, so {{that it did not}} face the direction of Macedonian advance full-square. This prevented Philip from attempting to concentrate his force on <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> right wing, since the advanced position of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> left wing would then threaten Philip's right. Although Philip could attempt to concentrate his force against <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> left, the troops there occupied high ground, and any attack would be difficult. Since the Greeks could remain on the defensive, having only to prevent Philip's advance, their position was therefore strategically and tactically very strong.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> force, the Persians emerged from the camp but <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> fleet.|$|E

50|$|The Scottish Admiral Lord Cochrane and Irish General Richard Church were {{nominally}} commanding <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> 3,000 {{men were}} ordered to advance across the plain. Their plan was to send 7,000 more men who were at Piraeus to attack the Turks from the flanks. As <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> advanced from Phaleron, Reshid sent some cavalry to attack <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> He expected <b>the</b> main assault to come from Piraeus.

5|$|A bronze {{column in}} the shape of {{intertwined}} snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> colony of Byzantium.|$|E

50|$|In his Histories, Herodotus gives <b>the</b> Persian and <b>Greek</b> {{accounts}} {{of a series}} of kidnappings that led to the Trojan War. While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians kidnapped a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of Helen from Argos. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall the Persians considered <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> to be their enemy.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> on land was {{offset by the}} defeats of the Athenian fleet at the Hellespont and Amorgos by the Macedonian navy. The Macedonians, now with control of the sea were able to {{transfer}} troops to Europe. Though <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> defeated <b>the</b> Macedonian reinforcements at Rhamnus, the Macedonians were able to leave from Lamia and unite with {{the remnants of the}} defeated army. The combined Macedonian forces were assisted by the arrival of more troops from Asia and defeated <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> at <b>the</b> Crannon and effectively ended the revolt of <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> minister in Berne, acting under the direction of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic.

Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E

5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not {{because it was a}} large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E

They caught up with <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> outside Ephesus and <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to catch up with <b>the</b> <b>Greeks).</b> <b>The</b> typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|R
