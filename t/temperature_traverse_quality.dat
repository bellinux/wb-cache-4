40|$|Introduction and Summary Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} and, at the same time, most difficult Problem {{in the design and}} development of gas turbine combustion chambers, is that of achieving a satisfactory and consistent distribution of temperature in the efflux gases discharging into the turbine. In the past, experience has {{played a major role in}} the determination of dilution-zone geometry, and trial and error methods have of necessity been employed in developing the temperature-traverse quality of individual combustor designs to a satisfactory standard. Experimental investigations into dilution-zone performance carried out on actual chambers have led to useful empirical-design data, but very often it has proved difficult or impossible to distinguish the separate influences of all the variables involved. Thus although it is now generally accepted that a satisfactory temperature profile is dependent upon adequate penetration of the dilution jets, coupled with the correct number of jets to form sufficient localized mixing regions, the manner in which the total dilution-hole area is Utilized in terms of number and size of holes is still largely a matter of experience. Unfortunately, more basic studies of jet mixing do not usually yield results that can readily be expressed in the parameters which are most familiar to those concerned with combustion-chamber design. However, some of these investigations can provide a useful guide to the relationships involved. One such investigation resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of data on the mixing of cold jets when injected into hot streams under conditions where the temperature and velocity of the hot and cold streams, the injection-hole diameter, the angle of injection, and the mixing length could be accurately controlled and varied over a wide range. These data are used here, firstly to demonstrate a logical method of dilution zone design and, secondly, to provide quantitative data on the rate of exchange between <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse</b> <b>quality</b> and the relevant design parameters such as dilution zone length, dilution hole diameter and pressure loss factor. The effects of chamber inlet velocity and inlet velocity profile are also examined. Finally, it is proposed that the aerodynamic performance and stability of a combustion chamber may, for most practical purposes, be adequately described in terms of a parameter p which is the ratio of the flametube pressure loss to the overall pressure loss.

The hot gas stream was supplied to a 6. 875 in*, diameter mixing duct at the desired temperatures by a modified combustion chamber. The jet diameters were 0. 75 in., 1. 00 in. and 1. 25 in. {{and the number of}} jets selected was either 4 or 8. <b>Temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> were made at three cross sections downstream of the jet 13; origin, their distances being 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 duct diameters respectively from the jet origin.

40|$|Abstract: Temperature changes {{according}} to land use patterns become a common phenomenon {{in many cities}} around the globe. Various techniques and methods used to show the trend of temperature changes {{according to}} land use pattern in the city. One method is using <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse.</b> Based on this method of temperature measurements the north-south and east-west traverses were monitored and conducted {{in the city of}} Jakarta for the period from October 2012 to March 2013. Both the <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> were carried out between 11 : 00 and 13 : 00 hrs. In general, the study found that the average monthly temperature is 34. 9 °C for the north south traverse with the CV of 4. 4 and east-west traverse is 34. 4 °C with the CV of 5. 6. Additionally, there was also the average temperature on weekdays (HK) for the north south and east west of 35. 3 °C with the CV of 3. 0 and 34. 8 °C with the CV of 2. 6 respectively. Thus, the average temperature {{at the time of the}} holidays (HC) for the north south and east west were 34. 4 °C and 33. 7 °C, respectively with the CV of 2. 2 and 1. 1. Furthermore highest monthly temperature trends are occurring in October of 36. 2 °C for the north south and 37. 7 °C for the east-west traverses. Conversely, the lowest in November with an average value of 33. 4 °C for the north-south traverse, meanwhile the lowest temperature trends for the east-west traverse in the months of November and February with an average value of monthly temperature is 32. 5 °C. Based on observations obtained through the <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse</b> the average value of the urban heat island intensity for the north-south traverse is 2. 0 °C while for the east - west traverse is 0. 7 °C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increase}} of urban air temperature {{is a common}} phenomenon experiences by many cities in the world including Jakarta, Indonesia. One method to trace out this temperature increased is <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse</b> across different land use types in an urban area. For this study, observation was carried out for six months; starting from October 2011 to March 2012 {{and a total of}} 26 and 20 stations were created along the north-south and the east-west traverses, respectively. The results showed that the average monthly temperature of 28. 3 °C was calculated for a north-south traverse during the night, with the highest temperature of 29. 0 ° C was recorded at the Jembatan Merah bus station point and the Swiss Hotel point. Meanwhile, the lowest temperature of 26. 9 ° C was recorded at the Pintu Gerbang Universitas Indonsia point station. On a monthly basis, February was recorded the lowest temperature (27. 4 ° C), while October was recorded the highest temperature (2 9. 4 ° C). For the east-west traverse, the monthly average temperature was 28. 3 ° C where the highest temperature of 29. 2 °C was recorded at the Taman Kota Pondok Kopi station; meanwhile the lowest temperature of 27. 6 °C was recorded at the Flay over Ciledug station. In addition, October was recorded the highest temperature (29. 5 ° C), while February was observed the lowest temperature (27. 3 °C). Based on these <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses,</b> the average value of the urban heat island intensity during the night time was calculated at 2. 1 °C for the north -south traverse; meanwhile the value of UH II of 1. 6 °C was calculated for the east -west traverse during the nighttime. These high temperatures across various land uses in the city of Jakarta have definitely affects the thermal discomfort feeling among the urban dwellers of the Jakarta City...|$|R
40|$|A {{problem which}} arises during {{shipment}} of irradiated fuel elements is Urat {{of the maximum}} surface temperature which might be reached when the element is air-cooled by natural convection only. In an investigation of this problem, several irradiated Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) fuel elements were raised into a hot cell, and their <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> were measured. Correlations between masimum surface temperature and the irradiation history of the element were made by using the Way-Wigner formula and the data of Perkins and King.

It is felt that the results, while not directly applicable to elements other than those from the ORR, can assist in establishing orders of magnitude and will provide a bssis for more genenalized extensions.

40|$|A recent re-evaluation {{of urban}} heat island (UHI) studies has {{suggested}} that the urban effect may be expressed more meaningfully as a difference between Local Climate Zones (LCZ), defined as areas with characteristic dimensions of between one and several kilometers that have distinct effects on climate at both micro-and local-scales (city streets to neighborhoods), rather than adopting the traditional method of comparing urban and rural air temperatures. This paper reports on a UHI study in Dublin (Ireland) which maps the urban area into LCZ and uses these as a basis for carrying out a UHI study. The LCZ map for Dublin is derived using a widely available land use/cover map as a basis. A small network of in-situ stations is deployed into different LCZ across Dublin and additional mobile <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> carried out to examine the thermal characteristics of LCZ following mixed weather during a 1 week period in August 2010.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{program was}} started in 1994 {{within the framework of}} the German Aeronautics Research Program to develop axial staged combustor technology up to a core engine demonstrator. The objective was to demonstrate a 50 % NOx reduction against the ICAO CAEP II limit without any compromise on the CO, UHC and smoke emission level compared to the latest single annular combustor technology. All other requirements, like ignition and relight capability, stability, durability and turbine inlet <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse,</b> were set equal to today’s state-of-the-art combustors. The combustor cooling concept chosen was of the angled effusion type. Development of adequate modeling techniques and steady-state and transient rig tests to calibrate the thermal models was the key factor for the success of the project. Despite the 15 % increase in cooled surface, the overall combustor flow fraction required for cooling was reduced by 15 % without any change in the combustor liner material from that of the in-service single annular combustor of the BR 715. The axially staged combustor technology developed in the described program enables RR Deutschland to offer a staged combustor for the BR 715 within the usual timescale of an engine certification process. It also forms the basis for future combustor technology to limit NOx-emissions for advanced engine cycles. Nomenclature Ageom Geometric coolant flow area AFR Air fuel rati...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the results of}} {{experimental}} work performed to determine local heat transfer coefficients for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow through pipes with abrupt discontinuities are reported. The fluids investigated were water-based polymeric solutiorrs of time-indpendent, pseudoplastic materials, with flow indices "n" ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 9. The tube configurations were a 3. 3 : 1 sudden convergence, and a 1 : 3. 3 sudden divergence. The condition of a prescribed uniform wall heat flux was considered, with both upstream and downstream tube sections heated. Radial <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> were also under­ taken primarily to justify the procedures used in estimating the tube wall and bulk fluid temperatures and secondly to give further insight into the mechanism of heat transfer beyond a sudden tube expansion. A theoretical assessment {{of the influence of}} viscous dissipation on a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluid of' arbitrary index "n" was carried out. The effects of other secondary factors such as free convection and temperature-dependent consistency were evaluated empirically. In the present investigations, the test conditions were chosen to minimise the effects of natural convection and the estimates of viscous heat generation showed the effect to be insignificant with the polymeric concentrations tested here. The final results have been presented as the relationships between local heat transfer coef'ficient and axial distance downstream of the discontinuities and relationships between dimensionless wall temperature and reduced radius. The influence of Reynolds number, Prandtl number, non-Newtonian index and heat flux have been indicated...|$|R
40|$|The urban thermal {{environment}} varies {{not only from}} its rural surroundings but also within the urban area due to intra-urban differences in land-use and surface characteristics. Understanding the causes of this intra-urban variability {{is a first step}} in improving urban planning and development. Toward this end, a method for quantifying causes of spatial variability in the urban heat island has been developed. This paper presents the method as applied to a specific test case of Portland, Oregon. Vehicle <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses</b> were used to determine spatial differences in summertime ∼ 2 m air temperature across the metropolitan area in the afternoon. A tree-structured regression model was used to quantify the land-use and surface characteristics that have the greatest influence on daytime UHI intensity. The most important urban characteristic separating warmer from cooler regions of the Portland metropolitan area was canopy cover. Roadway area density was also an important determinant of local UHI magnitudes. Specifically, the air above major arterial roads was found to be warmer on weekdays than weekends, possibly due to increased anthropogenic activity from the vehicle sector on weekdays. In general, warmer regions of the city were associated with industrial and commercial land-use. The downtown core, whilst warmer than the rural surroundings, was not the warmest part of the Portland metropolitan area. This is thought to be {{due in large part to}} local shading effects in the urban canyons. © Springer-Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the transition process on flat-plate and concave curved-wall boundary layers for various free-stream turbulence levels was performed. Results show that for transition of a flat-plate, the two forms of boundary layer behavior, identified as laminar-like and turbulent-like, cannot {{be thought of as}} separate Blasius and fully-turbulent profiles, respectively. Thus, simple transition models in which the desired quantity is assumed to be an average, weighted on intermittency, of the theoretical laminar and fully turbulent values is not expected to be successful. Deviation of the flow identified as laminar-like from theoretical laminar behavior is shown to be due to recovery after the passage of a turbulent spot, while deviation of the flow identified as turbulent-like from the full-turbulent values is thought to be due to incomplete establishment of the fully-turbulent power spectral distribution. Turbulent Prandtl numbers for the transitional flow, computed from measured shear stress, turbulent heat flux and mean velocity and temperature profiles, were less than unity. For the curved-wall case with low free-stream turbulence intensity, the existence of Gortler vortices on the concave wall within both laminar and turbulent flows was established using liquid crystal visualization and spanwise velocity and <b>temperature</b> <b>traverses.</b> Transition was found to occur via a vortex breakdown mode. The vortex wavelength was quite irregular in both the laminar and turbulent flows, but the vortices were stable in time and space. The upwash was found to be more unstable, with higher levels of u' and u'v', and lower skin friction coefficients and shape factors. Turbulent Prandtl numbers, measured using a triple-wire probe, were found to be near unity for all post-transitional profiles, indicating no gross violation of Reynolds analogy.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. The trend for higher overall {{pressure}} ratios means that turbine entry temperatures are continually increasing. Furthermore, {{the development of}} lean, low-emission combustion systems reduces the availability of cooling air and is accompanied by new problems at the combustor/turbine interface. For example, the exit <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse</b> differs from that found in traditional rich-burn combustors with increased swirl and a much flatter profile. Effectively cooling the turbine components is becoming increasingly difficult. One solution is to employ cooled cooling air (CCA) {{where some of the}} compressor efflux is diverted for additional cooling in a heat exchanger located in the by-pass duct. An example CCA system is presented which includes an off-take within the dump cavity and the addition of radial struts within the pre-diffuser through which the cooled air is returned to the engine core. This paper addresses the impact this CCA system has on the combustion system external aerodynamics. This included the development of a fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and combustor geometry. A datum aerodynamic performance was established for a non-CCA configuration with a clean, un-strutted prediffuser. Results for this baseline CCA system demonstrated that inclusion of a bleed in the dump cavity had limited effect on the overall flow field. However, the inclusion of struts within the pre-diffuser caused a reduction in area ratio and a notable increase in system loss. Consequently an alternative pre-diffuser was designed (using CFD) with the aim of increasing the area ratio back to that of the un-strutted datum. A so-called hybrid diffuser was designed in which the CCA bleed was moved to the pre-diffuser outer wall. The bleed was then used to re-energize the boundary layer, preventing flow separation, enabling the area ratio to be increased close to the datum value. The mechanisms of the hybrid diffuser are complex; the geometry of the off-take and its location with respect to the OGV and strut leading edge were seen to be critical. Experimental evaluation of the final design demonstrated the effective operation the hybrid diffuser with the result that the system loss returned to a level close to that of the datum. Only small differences were seen in the overall flow field...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that climate change}} {{is a very serious}} environmental concern. Levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other emissions in the global atmosphere have increased substantially since the industrial revolution and now increasing faster than ever before. There is a thought that this has already led to dangerous warming in the Earth’s atmosphere and relevant changes around. Emissions legislations are going to be stringent as the years will pass. Hydro carbon fuel cost is also increasing substantially; more over this is non- renewable source of energy. There is an urgent need for novel combustor technologies for reducing emission as well as exploring alternative renewable fuels without effecting combustor performance. Development of novel combustors needs comprehensive understanding of conventional combustors. The design and development of gas turbine combustors is a crucial but uncertain part of an engine development process. At present, the design process relies upon a wealth of experimental data and correlations. Some major engine manufacturers have addressed the above problem by developing computer programs based on tests and empirical data to assist combustor designers, but such programs are proprietary. There is a need of developing design methodologies for combustors which would lead to substantial contribution to knowledge in field of combustors. Developed design methodologies would be useful for researchers for preliminary design assessments of a gas turbine combustor. In this study, step by step design methodologies of dual annular radial and axial combustor, triple annular combustor and reverse flow combustor have been developed. Design methodologies developed could be used to carry out preliminary design along with performance analysis for conventional combustion chambers. In this study the author has also proposed and undertaken preliminary studies of some novel combustor concepts. A novel concept of a dilution zone less combustor has been proposed in this study. According to this concept dilution air would be introduced through nozzle guide vanes to provide an optimum <b>temperature</b> <b>traverse</b> for turbine blades. Preliminary study on novel dilution zone less combustor predicts that the length of this combustor would be shorter compared to conventional case, resulting in reduced weight, fuel burn and vibrations. Reduced fuel burn eventually leads to lower emissions. Another novel concept of combustor with hydrogen synthesis from kerosene reformation has been proposed and a preliminary studies has been undertaken in this work. Addition of hydrogen as an additive in gas turbine combustor shows large benefits to the performance of gas turbine engines in addition to reduction in NOx levels. The novel combustor would have two stages, combustion of ~ 5 % of the hydrocarbon fuel would occur in the first stage at higher equivalence ratios {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, which would eventually lead to the formation of hydrogen rich flue gases. In the subsequent stage the hydrogen rich flue gases from the first stage would act as an additive to combustion of the hydrocarbon fuel. It has been preliminary estimated that the mixture of the hydrocarbon fuel and air could subsequently be burned at much lower equivalence ratios than conventional cases, giving better temperature profiles, flame stability limits and lower NOx emissions. The effect of different geometrical parameters on the performance of vortex controlled hybrid diffuser has also been studied. It has been predicted that vortex chamber in vortex controlled hybrid diffuser does not play any role in altering the performance of diffuser. The overall contribution to knowledge of this study is development of combustor preliminary design methodologies with different variants. The other contribution to knowledge is related to novel combustors with a capability to produce low emissions. Study on novel combustor and diffuser has yielded application of two patent applications with several other publications which has resulted in a contribution to knowledge.

Measured in-flow noise levels in the tunnel test section were reduced by about 10 dB with the new microphone holders compared with those measured with the older, less refined microphone holders. Wake interference patterns between fixed wall microphones were measured and resulted in preferred placement patterns for these microphones to minimize these effects. Acoustic data from a model turbofan operating in the tunnel test section showed that results for the fixed and translating microphones were equivalent for common azimuthal angles, suggesting that the translating microphone probe, with its significantly greater angular resolution, is preferred for sideline noise measurements.

Apart from a conventional signal detection arrangement, FRS was also applied with an endoscope for signal collection, to assess its feasibility for future application in a full annular combustor with restricted optical access. Both techniques are complementary in several respects, which justified their combined application. OH-PLIF allows instantaneous measurements and therefore enables local temperature statistics, but is limited to relatively high temperatures. On the other hand FRS can also be applied at low temperatures, which makes it particularly attractive for measurements in cooling layers. However, FRS requires long sampling times and therefore can only provide temporal averages. When applied in combination, the accuracy of both techniques could be improved by each method helping to overcome the other's shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} charge {{changing}} cross sections of fast ions colliding with matter provides the fundamental {{basis for the}} analysis of the charge states produced in such interactions. Given the high degree of complexity of the phenomena, there is no theoretical treatment able to give a comprehensive description. In fact, the involved processes are very dependent on the basic parameters of the projectile, such as velocity charge state, and atomic number, and on the target parameters, the physical state (molecular, atomic or ionized matter) and density. The target velocity, may have also incidence on the process, through the <b>temperature</b> of the <b>traversed</b> medium. In addition, multiple electron transfer in single collisions intrincates more the phenomena. Though, in simplified cases, such as protons moving through atomic hydrogen, considerable agreement has been obtained between theory and experiments However, in general the available theoretical approaches have only limited validity in restricted regions of the basic parameters. Since most measurements of charge changing cross sections are performed in atomic matter at ambient temperature, models are commonly based on the assumption of targets at rest, however at Astrophysical scales, temperature displays a wide range in atomic and ionized matter. Therefore, {{due to the lack of}} experimental data, an attempt is made here to quantify temperature dependent cross sections on basis to somewhat arbitrary, but physically reasonable assumptions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The mean {{pulsation}} {{period of}} ZZ Ceti stars increases with decreasing effective <b>temperature</b> as we <b>traverse</b> {{from the blue}} to the red edge of the instability strip. This well-established correlation between the mean period and spectroscopic temperature suggests that the mean period could be utilized {{as a tool to}} measure the relative temperature of the star independent of spectroscopy. Measuring the pulsation periods of a ZZ Ceti star is a simple, model-independent, and straight forward process as opposed to a spectroscopic determination of its temperature. Internal uncertainties in determining the spectroscopic temperature of a ZZ Ceti star are at least 200 K, 15 % of the 1350 K width of the instability strip. The uncertainties in determining the mean period arise mostly from amplitude modulation in the pulsation spectrum and are smaller than 100 s for 91 % of the ZZ Ceti stars, < 8 % of the 1300 s width of the instability strip. In principle this implies that for 90 % of the ZZ Ceti stars, the average uncertainty in determining the location of a ZZ Ceti star within the instability strip decreases by a factor of two in utilizing the mean period of the ZZ Ceti star as a temperature indicator rather than conventional spectroscopy. Presently we only claim that the relative temperatures of ZZ Ceti stars derived by using the mean pulsation period are certainly as good as and perhaps about 15 % better than spectroscopy. 1...|$|R
40|$|High overall {{pressure}} ratio (OPR) engine cycles for reduced NOx emissions will generate new aggravated requirements and boundary conditions by implementing low emission combustion technologies into advanced engine architectures. Lean burn combustion systems {{will have a}} significant impact on the <b>temperature</b> and velocity <b>traverse</b> at the combustor exit. Lean burn fuel injectors dominate the combustor exit conditions. This is due to the fact that they pass a majority of the total combustor flow, and to the lack of mixing jets like in a conventional combustor. With the transition to high-pressure engines, it is essential to fully understand and determine the high energetic interface between combustor and turbine to avoid excessive cooling. Velocity distributions and their fluctuations at the combustor exit for lean burn are of special interest as they can influence the efficiency and capacity of the turbine. A lean burn single-sector combustor was designed and built at DLR, providing optical access to its rectangular exit section. The sector was operated with a fuel-staged lean burn injector. Measurements were performed under idle and cruise operating conditions. Two velocity measurement techniques were used in the demanding environment of highly luminous flames under elevated pressures: particle image velocimetry (PIV) and filtered Rayleigh scattering (FRS).

40|$|Aims. Despite their {{importance}} {{to a number}} of astrophysical fields, the lifecycles of very massive stars are still poorly defined. In order to address this shortcoming, we present a detailed quantitative study of the physical properties of four early-B hypergiants (BHGs) of spectral type B 1 - 4 Ia +; Cyg OB 2 # 12, ζ 1 Sco, HD 190603 and BP Cru. These are combined with an analysis of their long-term spectroscopic and photometric behaviour in order to determine their evolutionary status. Methods. Quantitative analysis of UV–radio photometric and spectroscopic datasets was undertaken with a non-LTE model atmosphere code in order to derive physical parameters for comparison with apparently closely related objects, such as B supergiants (BSGs) and luminous blue variables (LBVs), and theoretical evolutionary predictions. Results. The long-term photospheric and spectroscopic datasets compiled for the early-B HGs revealed that they are remarkably stable over long periods (≥ 40 yrs), {{with the possible exception of}} ζ 1 Sco prior to the 20 th century; in contrast to the typical excursions that characterise LBVs. Quantitative analysis of ζ 1 Sco, HD 190603 and BP Cru yielded physical properties intermediate between BSGs and LBVs; we therefore suggest that BHGs are the immediate descendants and progenitors (respectively) of such stars, for initial masses in the range 30 − 60 M ⊙. Comparison of the properties of ζ 1 Sco with the stellar population of its host cluster/association NGC 6231 /Sco OB 1 provides further support for such an evolutionary scenario. In contrast, while the wind properties of Cyg OB 2 # 12 are consistent with this hypothesis, the combination of extreme luminosity and spectroscopic mass (110 M ⊙) and comparatively low temperature means it cannot be accommodated in such a scheme. Likewise, despite its co-location with several LBVs above the Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit, the lack of long term variability and its unevolved chemistry apparently excludes such an identification. Since such massive stars are not expected to evolve to such cool <b>temperatures,</b> instead <b>traversing</b> an O 4 - 6 Ia → O 4 - 6 Ia + → WN 7 - 9 ha pathway, the properties of Cyg OB 2 # 12 are therefore difficult to understand under current evolutionary paradigms. Finally, we note that as with AG Car in its cool phase, despite exceeding the HD limit, the properties of Cyg OB 2 # 12 imply that it lies below the Eddington limit – thus we conclude that the HD limit does not define a region of the HR diagram inherently inimical to the presence of massive stars...|$|R

Velocity distributions and their fluctuations at the combustor exit for lean burn are of special interest as they can influence the efficiency and capacity of the turbine. Within the EU project LEMCOTEC, a lean burn single sector combustor was designed and built at DLR, providing optical access to its rectangular exit section. The sector was operated with a fuel staged lean burn injector from Rolls-Royce Deutschland. Measurements were performed under various operating conditions, covering idle and cruise operation. Two techniques were used to perform velocity measurements at the combustor exit in the demanding environment of highly luminous flames under elevated pressures: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Filtered Rayleigh Scattering (FRS). The latter was used for the first time in an aero-engine combustor environment. In addition to a conventional signal detection arrangement, FRS was also applied with an endoscope for signal collection, to assess its practicality for a potential future application in a full annular combustor with restricted optical access. Both measurement techniques are complementary in several respects, which justified their respective application and comparative assessment. PIV is able to record instantaneous velocity distributions and is therefore capable to deliver higher velocity moments, in addition to temporal averages. Applied in two orthogonal traversable light sheet arrangements, it could be used to map all three velocity components across the entire combustor cross section, and obtain data on velocity variances, cross-correlations and turbulence intensities. FRS is limited to measurements of average velocities, as long sampling times are required due to the weak physical process of Rayleigh scattering. However, FRS has two advantages: It requires no particle seeding, because it is based on the measurement of a molecular Doppler shift, and it can provide temperature information simultaneously. This contribution complements a second paper (GT 2016 - 56370) focusing on the measurement of temperature distributions at the same combustor exit section by laser-based optical methods...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the study}} of thermal {{transport}} in condensed matter has a very long history, {{it continues to be}} an active field of work due to its importance in many applications. The research subject reported in this thesis is on theoretical investigations of thermal energy transport in systems whose linear dimension is less than the wavelength of thermal phonons. Such situations occur in mesoscopic and nanoscopic scale dielectric structures which can now be fabricated in a number of laboratories. Due to the small system dimensions, phonons must be treated as waves. Thermal energy transport, therefore, must be treated as phonon wave propagation through the system. After reviewing the general physics of thermal energy transport in the classical regime, we derive, for dielectric materials, a formula for thermal energy flux in devices involving multi-terminals each connected to a thermal reservoir at local equilibrium. The energy flux is driven by a <b>temperature</b> bias and <b>traverses</b> the system by virtue of phonon wave scattering. A multi-terminal thermal conductance formula is derived in terms of phonon transmission coefficient. Using our theoretical formulation, we investigate thermal transport properties of both two-terminal and four-terminal dielectric devices by solving the quantum scattering problem using a mode matching numerical technique. For thermal transport in a T-shaped dielectric nanostructure with two-terminals at low temperature, due to quantum interference the transmission coefficient of phonons becomes quite complicated. We found that the value of phonon transmission coefficients at zero energy may be unity or zero depending on a geometrical ratio of the nanostructure. The transmission has an oscillation behavior with quasi-periodicity and irregularity. The thermal conductance is found to increase monotonically with temperature [...] -a result that we conclude to be generally true for any two-terminal device. We confirm the existence of the universal quantum of thermal conductance which exists at the low temperature limit, and such a quantum is robust against all the system parameters. The physical behavior of four-terminal thermal conductance for mesoscopic dielectric systems with arbitrary shapes of scattering region is also investigated in detail. If we make a two-terminal measurement in the four-terminal device, the two-terminal conductance is a monotonically increasing function of temperature, and is equal to the universal quantum of thermal conductance masked by a geometric factor. If we make a four-terminal measurement, the four-terminal conductance has a non-monotonic dependence. In the low temperature limit, we predict that the four-terminal conductance diverges inversely proportional to temperature. Finally, we discuss an interesting theoretical problem on the general behavior of thermal conductance for multi-terminal systems when thermal carriers satisfy fractional exclusion statistics. Our analysis allows us to conclude that results for fractional exclusion statistics are quite {{different from those of the}} Bose-Einstein statistics...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Ignition by a jet of hot {{combustion}} product gas injected into a premixed combustible mixture from a separate pre-chamber {{is a complex}} phenomenon with jet penetration, vortex generation, flame and shock propagation and interaction. It has been considered a useful approach for lean, low-NOx combustion for automotive engines, pulsed detonation engines and wave rotor combustors. The hot-jet ignition constant-volume combustor (CVC) rig established at the Combustion and Propulsion Research Laboratory (CPRL) of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is considered for numerical study. The CVC chamber contains stoichiometric methane-hydrogen blends, with pre-chamber being operated with slightly rich blends. Five operating and design parameters were investigated {{with respect to their}} eff ects on ignition timing. Di fderent pre-chamber pressure (2, 4 and 6 bar), CVC chamber fuel blends (Fuel-A: 30 % methane + 70 % hydrogen and Fuel-B: 50 % methane + 50 % hydrogen by volume), active radicals in pre-chamber combusted products (H, OH, O and NO), CVC chamber temperature (298 K and 514 K) and pre-chamber traverse speed (0. 983 m/s, 4. 917 m/s and 13. 112 m/s) are considered which span a range of fluid-dynamic mixing and chemical time scales. Ignition delay of the fuel-air mixture in the CVC chamber is investigated using a detailed mechanism with 21 species and 84 elementary reactions (DRM 19). To speed up the kinetic process adaptive mesh refi nement (AMR) based on velocity and temperature and multi-zone reaction technique is used. With 3 D numerical simulations, the present work explains the e ffects of pre-chamber pressure, CVC chamber initial <b>temperature</b> and jet <b>traverse</b> speed on ignition for a speci fic set of fuels. An innovative post processing technique is developed to predict and understand the characteristics of ignition in 3 D space and time. With the increase of pre-chamber pressure, ignition delay decreases for Fuel-A which is the relatively more reactive fuel blend. For Fuel-B which is relatively less reactive fuel blend, ignition occurs only for 2 bar pre-chamber pressure for centered stationary jet. Inclusion of active radicals in pre-chamber combusted product decreases the ignition delay when compared with only the stable species in pre-chamber combusted product. The eff ects of shock-flame interaction on heat release rate is observed by studying flame surface area and vorticity changes. In general, shock-flame interaction increases heat release rate by increasing mixing (increase the amount of deposited vorticity on flame surface) and flame stretching. The heat release rate is found to be maximum just after fast-slow interaction. For Fuel-A, increasing jet traverse speed decreases the ignition delay for relatively higher pre-chamber pressures (6 and 4 bar). Only 6 bar pre-chamber pressure is considered for Fuel-B with three di fferent pre-chamber traverse speeds. Fuel-B fails to ignite within the simulation time for all the traverse speeds. Higher initial CVC temperature (514 K) decreases the ignition delay for both fuels when compared with relatively lower initial CVC temperature (300 K). For initial temperature of 514 K, the ignition of Fuel-B is successful for all the pre-chamber pressures with lowest ignition delay observed for the intermediate 4 bar pre-chamber pressure. Fuel-A has the lowest ignition delay for 6 bar pre-chamber pressure. A speci fic range of pre-chamber combusted products mass fraction, CVC chamber fuel mass fraction and temperature are found at ignition point for Fuel-A which were liable for ignition initiation. The behavior of less reactive Fuel-B appears to me more complex at room temperature initial condition. No simple conclusions could be made about the range of pre-chamber and CVC chamber mass fractions at ignition point...|$|R
