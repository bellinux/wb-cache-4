5|$|In 1854, the Diocese of Chichester {{selected}} {{an area of}} open land on {{the west}} side of Ditchling Road as the site of their <b>Training</b> <b>College</b> for Anglican Schoolmistresses, which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town. Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building's south façade around the same time, and was built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s. In the early 20th century, the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers. Before that, the trainee teachers slept in large rooms in the <b>Training</b> <b>College.</b>|$|E

The Grade II-listed knapped flint Gothic Revival structure, designed by William and Edward Habershon, was built in 1854 on open land at the northern boundary of Brighton Borough as the Diocese of Chichester's <b>training</b> <b>college</b> for Anglican schoolmistresses. It was extended to the north in 1886, and {{was used as a}} <b>training</b> <b>college</b> until the Second World War, when the Royal Engineers requisitioned it and used it to store their records and archives. After its closure in 1987, it was briefly threatened with demolition, but in 1988 it was converted into serviced offices under the name Brighton Business Centre (later Brighton Forum).|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this study, conducted in Kabul province, {{is to find out}} important differences and similarities between public and private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> that are operating in 2014 and to find out implications such variations might have for quality of teacher education. Secondary objectives of this study are: a) to explore possible associations between demographic and socio-economic characteristics of student-teachers and the type of Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> and b) to explore possible association between motivations behind studying in Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> and the type of Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> This study has targeted directors, lecturers and students from the Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Questionnaires were prepared including items concerning demographic and socio-economic information and thereafter distributed to all three groups. Furthermore, the participants responded about the motivations for students and teachers to enroll in the Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> The study will also investigate if eventual differences existed in the enrolment procedures of the students and the recruitment process of the teachers between public and private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Based on Ministry of Education’s policy implementation this study found more similarities than differences between public and private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Differences included enrolment of students through advertisement by the private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> while public Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> enrolled students through the university-admission test called kankor. The recruitment process of teachers’ was the same, at both public and Private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> –in which recruited teachers should have minimum 75 % average marks at university. The main motives behind teachers’ teaching at public and private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> were either close distance to their houses or similar cultural environment at Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Likewise, many students at Private Teacher <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> were enrolled because of high quality of education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{relation}} between vocational qualification system and specialized <b>training</b> <b>colleges.</b> Through a historical investigation, the following two points become clear about the relation. First, it is cleared that, since vocational qualification system has not had a definite idea and regular schools have been in short supply, specialized <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> have been admitted as training schools for vocational qualifications. Second, it is cleared that, only specialized <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> admitted as <b>training</b> schools for vocational qualifications have developed in their own way. In conclusion, specialized <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> should be classified according to the vocational qualification, and vocational qualification system should have a definite idea in the future...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1995 The aims of {{this study}} are to {{determine}} the nature of strategic management, with specific reference to the external environmental analysis; to analyze emerging trends and challenges in the external environment of teacher <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> and to provide guidelines for the strategic repositioning of teacher <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> in South Africa. By means of a literature study it was determined that fundamental changes in the external environment of teacher <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> in South Africa necessitated that these organizations adopt a pro-active approach with the intention of prospering in the future. Teacher <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> need to engage in a process of strategic management. A vast range of stakeholders recently became involved in education. As external forces, not under the direct control of an organization, are always dominant in determining the organization's destiny, the external environment of teacher <b>training</b> <b>colleges</b> has been analyzed with the aim of identifying changes that could directly and indirectly influence these organizations. Based on the external environmental analysis, a number of principles for future education have been identified.

5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A <b>training</b> <b>college</b> for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
