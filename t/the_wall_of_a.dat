5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Having grown {{attached}} to Tawna during {{their time in}} captivity, Crash resolves to rescue her and defeat Cortex. From the beach of N. Sanity Island, Crash makes {{his way through the}} nearby jungle and scales <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant wooden fortress, which is inhabited by the native tribe. Crash then enters the hut of tribe leader Papu Papu and is forced to defeat him in self-defense after inadvertently waking him from his nap. Riding {{on the back of a}} wild hog, Crash escapes the pursuing villagers and climbs over the opposite fortress wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, she struck <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last {{more than half a}} century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E

5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene {{was added to the}} pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} along the coastline, including {{a total of}} 19.1inches (486mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2inches (50mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40houses, {{and a total of}} 72people were forced to leave their homes. In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prison collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a fire when a transformer exploded. No deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|Arriving to Olot, most of Juigné's force took {{positions}} {{inside the}} convent of El Carme, while 90 Swiss {{soldiers of the}} rear entrenched themselves inside the hospital of the village. While the Swiss troops promptly surrendered, {{the bulk of the}} French column, with Juigné himself, still held for two hours. The miquelets and peasants encircled the building and managed to open a gap in its walls, only to be repelled in the hand-to-hand fight, losing two men killed and one wounded. Sala's men then breached <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chapel and stormed the convent again, but as the French were well clustered within, the assault was as well repelled. Sala ordered to set on fire the gates of the building, but the French walled the gap using stones and bricks. The Catalans managed to enter the building by setting on fire large amounts of pitch and sulfur on the two breaches they had opened. The fire and the smoke blinded and choked the French soldiers, which retreated to the convent's cloister. After that, Juigné, seriously wounded during the fight, requested terms and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Havana {{sustained}} major {{damage from}} the hurricane, with 50 houses destroyed, and cable operators in Miami, Santiago, and Jamaica were unable to reach telegraph services in the city. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legation of the United States was blown down. Vedado's sea baths were severely damaged. Havana's streetcar service was temporarily disrupted by the storm. Trees were blown down in the parks of Havana. Twenty {{people were killed in}} the city, while in Batabanó, nine people were killed, with many others missing. In Matanzas, the location of the United States' 28th Infantry, tents were destroyed and there was widespread damage. However, nobody was killed or injured in the city. In San Luis, tobacco crops were ruined, and 150 tobacco barns in the Alquízar municipality were destroyed. The sugar crop in Pinar del Río Province survived well during the hurricane. In the La Guria section of Cuba, the banana crops were completely destroyed. Rivers topped their banks throughout the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Chang Wei and his {{colleague}} discovered that ion rectification occurs {{at the tip of}} a nano-sized pipe. They observed that the surface charge at <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nano-pipet induced a non-neutral electrical potential within the orifice. The electrical potential then modifies the concentration of ion species, resulting in an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic for the current through the pipet.|$|E
