50|$|According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 44), the Prescription Law {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} to understanding the legal underpinnings of Israel’s acquisition of Palestinian lands. Although not readily apparent in the language of the law, the purpose behind this legislation was to enable Israel to claim as ‘State lands’ areas where Palestinians still predominated and where they could still assert their own claims on the land (for example, in the north of the country). The authors claim that this law, in conjunction with the Land (Settlement of Title) Ordinance (Amendment) Law, 5720-1960, the Land (Settlement of Title) Ordinance (New Version), 5729-1969 and the Land Law, 5729-1969, was designed <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>criteria</b> related to the use and registration of Miri lands - one of the most prevalent types in Palestine - and to facilitate Israel’s acquisition of such land.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) relies primarily on clinical features and remains challenging. The specificity {{of the recently}} <b>revised</b> <b>criteria</b> can be disappointing, justifying development of new clinical tools. Objective: We produced a behavioral inventory named DAPHNE. This scale (adapted from Rascovsky's criteria) explores six domains: disinhibition, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, personal neglect and loss of empathy. It is composed of ten items (five answer categories). The aim was (1) to assess the validity and reliability of DAPHNE and (2) to evaluate its contribution in differentiating patients. Methods: Two scores were computed: DAPHNE- 6 (screening) from the six domains and DAPHNE- 40 (diagnosis) from the ten items. Reliability and reproducibility were assessed. External validity was studied with the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Frontotemporal Behavioral Scale (FBS). Finally, the diagnostic performance of DAPHNE was compared <b>to</b> <b>revised</b> <b>criteria,</b> FBI and FBS. Results: DAPHNE was administered to the caregivers of 89 patients, 36 with bvFTD, 22 with Alzheimer's disease, 15 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 16 with bipolar disorder. Reliability and reproducibility were excellent, as was external validity. DAPHNE- 6 allowed bvFTD diagnosis (score ≥ 4) with a sensitivity of 92 %, while DAPHNE- 40 (score ≥ 15) had a specificity of 92 %.

40|$|Based on {{the recent}} {{literature}} and collective experience, an international consortium developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The validation process retrospectively reviewed clinical records and compared the sensitivity of proposed and earlier criteria in a multi-site sample of patients with pathologically verified frontotemporal lobar degeneration. According <b>to</b> the <b>revised</b> <b>criteria,</b> 'possible' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia requires three of six clinically discriminating features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseverative/compulsive behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile). 'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional disability and characteristic neuroimaging, while behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 'with definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration' requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation. Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation. Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and previously established criteria, 118 (86) met 'possible' criteria, and 104 (76) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53) met previously established criteria for the syndrome (P< 0. 001 for comparison with 'possible' and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed <b>to</b> meet <b>revised</b> <b>criteria</b> were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the <b>revised</b> <b>criteria</b> for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic features, less restrictive exclusion features and a flexible structure that accommodates different initial clinical presentations.

Overall, there were few statistically significant differences in PTSD caseness, associated psychiatric comorbidity, functional status, and structural validity across the two diagnostic criterion sets.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate SE subtypes on the basis of the American College of Rheumatology 1987 <b>revised</b> <b>criteria</b> for the classification of RA in a cohort of South African RA patients (n = 143) and their association with clinical and circulating biomarkers of disease activity (autoantibodies, acute phase reactants and cytokines). METHODS: Genomic DNA was analysed using high-resolution recombinant sequence-specific oligonucleotide PCR typing of the HLA-DRB 1 allele. Subtypes of the SE were classified according to the amino acids at positions 72 to 74 for the RAA sequence, and further sub-divided according to the amino acids at positions 70 and 71, which either contribute to (S 2, S 3 P), or negate (S 1, S 3 D) RA susceptibility. Disease activity was assessed on the basis of (1) Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein (CRP), (2) rheumatoid factor (RF), (3) CRP and (4) serum amyloid A by nephelometry, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (aCCP) by an immunofluorometric procedure, and cytokines by multiplex bead array technology. RESULTS: Of the 143 RA patients, 81 (57 %) were homozygous (SS) and 50 (35 %) were heterozygous (SX) for the SE alleles with significant overexpression of S 2 and S 3 P (respective odds ratios (ORs) 5. 3 and 5. 8; P < 0. 0001), and 12 (8 %) were classified as no SE allele (XX). Both the SS and SX groups showed a strong association with aCCP positivity (OR = 10. 2 and P = 0. 0010, OR = 9. 2 and P = 0. 0028, respectively) relative to the XX group. Clinical scores and concentrations of the other biomarkers of disease activity (RF, CRP and T helper cell type 1 (Th 1), Th 2, macrophage and fibroblast cytokines) were also generally higher in the SS group than in the SX and XX groups.
