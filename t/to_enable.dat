5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} talk {{produced by}} twenty-four newly qualified anaesthetists. Data {{were collected from}} round table discussions at the Young Fellows Conference of the Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists 2006. The talk consisted to an important extent of narratives about experiences of horror. The paper isolates three themes: the normalization of horror, the functionalisation of horror for pedagogic purposes, and the problematization of horror. The last theme provides a springboard into our argument that confronting the affect invested in coping with medical-clinical failure is central <b>to</b> <b>enabling</b> young doctors, and clinicians generally, to address and resolve such adverse events. We conclude that the negotiation of affect through shared or 'dialogic' narrative is central <b>to</b> <b>enabling</b> doctors <b>to</b> deal with adverse events on a personal level, and <b>to</b> <b>enabling</b> them at a collective level to become attentive to threats to patients' safety.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer a {{seemingly}} intractable question in English human rights law: how should we understand the nature, constituent elements and application of a human right <b>to</b> <b>enabled</b> suicide? A moral framework is developed, based on the theories of Alan Gewirth and Deryck Beyleveld, in order to critique the approach to such a right in English law. The thesis argues that current approaches have failed to articulate the status of this right fully, in particular as regards the balance between its exercise {{and the protection of}} the right to life of others. Thus, the thesis seeks to use Gewirthian theory to defend an alternative understanding of the human right <b>to</b> <b>enabled</b> suicide. This ethically justified right is used to resolve the intractable questions of human rights law that, it is argued, have undermined the legal response to the right <b>to</b> <b>enabled</b> suicide thus far. Specifically, the thesis will address the problem of a slippery slope resulting from possible abuse of procedures designed to give effect to the right. The thesis will also consider the defensibility of apparent inconsistency between English laws prohibiting assisted suicide and laws regulating different courses of ‘suicidal’ conduct such as refusal of vital treatments and ‘life-shortening’ treatment. The thesis will not claim that there is one ideal form of human rights-compliant legal response to these questions, but it will seek to justify certain minimal requirements of a Gewirthian conception of a human right <b>to</b> <b>enabled</b> suicide. The original and significant contribution of this thesis to knowledge is therefore the development of a detailed framework to govern the balance between the right <b>to</b> <b>enabled</b> suicide and the countervailing right to life, and the application of this framework to English law on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia...|$|R
