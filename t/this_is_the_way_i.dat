I reckon there's no sense in taking risks when you needn't. You've a mighty high-toned bunch of guests here. I'm not saying you haven't.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} what. But {{from this time}} forth I don't. It will be glorious not to let myself realize it.

[...] She took a pose in Cornelia's one chair, and put on an air of impenetrable mystery, which she relinquished a moment to explain, [...] "Of course this back is rather too stiff and straight; I shall be more crouching."

You know what this is, whose father lies in danger. Would you desert the poor soul? They have tried all ways with me. They have sought to bribe me; they offered me hills and valleys. And to-day that sleuth-hound told me how I stood, and to what a length {{he would go to}} butcher and disgrace me. I am to be brought in a party to the murder; I am to have held Glenure in talk for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and shamed. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> am to fall, and me scarce a man--if this is the story to be told of me in all Scotland--if you are to believe it too, and my name is to be nothing but a byword--Catriona, how can I go through with it? The thing's not possible; it's more than a man has in his heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hope and I {{have been}} talking and writing upon a scheme for raising [...] money to found in Scotland a college akin in {{structure}} to the [...] Romish seminaries in England; that is to say, partly for training [...] the clergy, partly for affording an education {{to the children of}} [...] the gentry and others who now go chiefly to presbyterian schools or [...] are tended at home by presbyterian tutors. I think £25,000 would do [...] it, and that it might be got. I must have my father's sanction [...] before committing myself to it. Hope's intended absence for the [...] winter is a great blow. Were he to be at home I do not doubt that [...] great progress might be made. In the kirk toil and trouble, double, [...] double, the fires burn and cauldrons bubble: and though I am not [...] sanguine as to very speedy or extensive resumption by the church of [...] her spiritual rights, she may have a great part to play.

6000|$|When {{his host}} {{had left the}} room, Dolph {{remained}} for some time lost in thought. His whole mind was occupied by what he had heard. Vander Spiegel was his mother's family name; and he recollected to have heard her speak of this very Killian Vander Spiegel {{as one of her}} ancestors. He had heard her say, too, that her father was Kollian's rightful heir, only that the old man died without leaving any thing to be inherited. It now appeared that Heer Antony was likewise a descendant, and perhaps an heir also, of this poor rich man; and that thus the Heyligers and the Vander Heydens were remotely connected. [...] "What," [...] thought he, [...] "if, after all, this is the interpretation of my dream, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> am to make my fortune by this voyage to Albany, and that I am to find the old man's hidden wealth in the bottom of that well? But what an odd, round-about mode of communicating the matter! Why the plague could not the old goblin have told me about the well at once, without sending me all the way to Albany to hear a story that was to send me all the way back again?" ...|$|E

60|$|But, Sleep. I WILL {{think about}} Sleep. I am {{determined}} to think (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> went on) about Sleep. I must hold the word Sleep, tight and fast, or I shall be {{off at a}} tangent in half a second. I feel myself unaccountably straying, already, into Clare Market. Sleep. It would be curious, as illustrating the equality of sleep, to inquire how many of its phenomena are common to all classes, to all degrees of wealth and poverty, to every grade of education and ignorance. Here, for example, is her Majesty Queen Victoria in her palace, this present blessed night, and here is Winking Charley, a sturdy vagrant, {{in one of her}} Majesty's jails. Her Majesty has fallen, many thousands of times, from that same Tower, which I claim a right to tumble off now and then. So has Winking Charley. Her Majesty in her sleep has opened or prorogued Parliament, or has held a Drawing Room, attired in some very scanty dress, the deficiencies and improprieties of which have caused her great uneasiness. I, in my degree, have suffered unspeakable agitation of mind from taking the chair at a public dinner at the London Tavern in my night-clothes, which not all the courtesy of my kind friend and host MR. BATHE could persuade me were quite adapted to the occasion. Winking Charley has been repeatedly tried in a worse condition. Her Majesty is no stranger to a vault or firmament, of a sort of floorcloth, with an indistinct pattern distantly resembling eyes, which occasionally obtrudes itself on her repose. Neither am I. Neither is Winking Charley. It is quite common to all three of us to skim along with airy strides a little above the ground; also to hold, with the deepest interest, dialogues with various people, all represented by ourselves; and to be at our wit's end to know {{what they are going to}} tell us; and to be indescribably astonished by the secrets they disclose. It is probable that we have all three committed murders and hidden bodies. It is pretty certain that we have all desperately wanted to cry out, and have had no voice; that we have all gone to the play and not been able to get in; that we have all dreamed much more of our youth than of our later lives; that - I have lost it! The thread's broken.|$|E
