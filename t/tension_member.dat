5000|$|Ductility {{is defined}} as ‘‘an {{extent to which a}} {{material}} can sustain plastic deformation without rupture.’’ It is not only required in the forming process but is also needed for plastic redistribution of stress in members and connections, where stress concentration would occur. The ductility criteria and performance of low-ductility steels for cold-formed members and connections have been studied by Dhalla, Winter, and Errera at Cornell University. It was found that the ductility measurement in a standard tension test includes local ductility and uniform ductility. Local ductility is designated as the localized elongation at the eventual fracture zone. Uniform ductility is the ability of a tension coupon to undergo sizeable plastic deformations along its entire length prior to necking. This study also revealed that for the different ductility steels investigated, the elongation in 2-in. (50.8-mm) gage length did not correlate satisfactorily with either the local or the uniform ductility of the material.

This study treats the effects of <b>tension</b> <b>member</b> installation on the buckling load and strength of a single layer two-way grid cylindrical shell roof by the numerical method. The tension members are installed to stiffen the rigidity of a single layer two-way grid shell roof and improve its stability behavior. <b>Tension</b> <b>member</b> installation and placement pattern is focused as both diagonal members of two-way grids and out-of-plane stiffened members in a cylindrical surface.

The <b>tension</b> <b>member</b> placement pattern, the load distribution patterns, the initial imperfections and the initial axial force are considered for the numerical calculation parameters.

40|$|The word {{tensegrity}} is a {{contraction of}} tensional integrity. In simple structural terms, tensegrity systems are self-stressed pin-jointed networks. Each node receives {{at least one}} strut (compression member) and three cables (<b>tension</b> <b>members).</b> <b>Tension</b> <b>members</b> are thus prestressed against adjoining compression members. This is a pure form of tensegrity where only compression and <b>tension</b> <b>members</b> co-exist to form free-standing structures requiring minimum anchorage system compared with conventional types of structures. Double layer tensegrity systems are interesting because the compression members are relatively short, making the network quite rigid and compact. In the non-prestressed state, the system could be easily deployed. The present paper reviews limited research so far conducted at Coventry University on double layer tensegrity networks.

40|$|Based on the {{definition}} {{given in the}} AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, twin steel box-girder bridges are classified as bridges with fracture critical members (FCMs), in which a failure of a <b>tension</b> <b>member</b> is expected {{to lead to a}} collapse of the bridge. However, a number of such bridges with either a partial or full-depth crack in one girder have been reported and are still providing service without collapsing. The main objective of this research project is to understand the behavior of twin steel box-girder bridges and to develop methods for evaluating their redundancy level in the event of the fracture of one <b>tension</b> <b>member.</b> The research project included an experimental investigation on a small-scale steel twin box-girder bridge, field testing of a full-scale twin box-girder, analysis of existing research and design data, and an extensive amount of numerical analyses carried out on calibrated 3 -D nonlinear finite element models. The results from this study provide in-depth understanding of twin steel box-girder bridge behavior before and after a fracture in the <b>tension</b> <b>member</b> occurs. In addition to the experimentally verified finite element method, the report also proposes simplified methods for evaluating the load-carrying capacity of twin steel box-girder bridges under vii concentrated loads and provides a list of important factors that could control the reserve capacity of the damaged bridge. The main conclusion of this research is that the redundancy exists in twin steel boxgirder bridges in an event that a fracture of a tension member(s) takes place. This research project also provides a comprehensive roadmap for assessing the redundancy of twin steel box-girder bridges in which the elements of the roadmap are identified, and solutions for several of the steps are provided. The development of solutions for remaining steps of the roadmap is proposed for a future research...|$|E

This concept was tested in a model of congestive heart failure. METHODS: Seven calves were used for the study (74. 3 +/- 4. 2 kg). Treatment efficacy was assessed with sonomicrometric wall motion analysis coupled with intraventricular pressure measurement. Preload increase was applied stepwise with <b>tension</b> <b>members</b> in released and tightened position. RESULTS: Tightening of the <b>tension</b> <b>members</b> improved systolic function for CVP> 10 mmHg (dP/dt: 828 +/- 122 vs. 895 +/- 112 mmHg/s, P= 0. 019, for baseline and 20 % stress level reduction respectively; wall thickening: 11. 6 +/- 1. 5 vs. 13. 3 +/- 1. 7 %, P 10 mmHg; peak rate of wall thinning: - 12. 2 +/- 2. 2 vs. - 14 +/- 2. 3 cm(2) /s, P 5 mmHg).

50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{structural}} components {{that make up}} a steel frame - <b>tension</b> <b>members,</b> compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. <b>Tension</b> <b>members</b> are usually found as web and chord members in trusses and open web steel joists. Ideally <b>tension</b> <b>members</b> carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and chord members in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as secondary loads. Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.Connections are what bring the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that they function together as one unit.|$|R

According to the damage mechanics theory, some micro- cracks were observed in the material with cyclic load.

By using the model of stress-strength interference, ignoring the effects of erosion and aging on the strength degradation, effective stress increasing lead by the change of damage were only taken into account. This research took the intensity as a random variable and view stress as a random variable which changed with the times of loading, and combined physical experiments and simulation of sampling. Furthermore, the dynamic reliability curve of the stress of <b>tension</b> <b>member</b> that changes with the loading times was simulated; the changing trends of dynamic reliability under different cyclic loading at the same temperature and the same cyclic loading at different temperatures were analyzed respectively.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{technology}} {{used in the}} building industry is best described as ancient {{when compared to the}} likes of the boat building and aviation industries. Competitive demands in these industries have lead to the development of lighter stronger materials and also construction methods. One such material is fibre reinforced plastic (FRP). One such means of implementing FRP into the building industry is to reinforce timber joints with FRP. This paper examines the strength and cost of constructing joints in this manner. The timber joint to be tested is a perpendicular connection between a member which is to have a tension load applied to it and another larger member that as a consequence will have a bending force applied to it. The fibre reinforcing is laminated to one face of the <b>tension</b> <b>member,</b> around the perpendicular member and onto the opposite face of the <b>tension</b> <b>member.</b> It is possible to manufacture strong fibre reinforced timber joints cost effectively. Timber member sizes will be reduced because joints can be constructed stronger than the member, benefiting the construction industry.
