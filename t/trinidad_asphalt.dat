50|$|While in Washington, Albright {{started an}} asphalt {{business}} with his brother-in-law, Amzi L. Barber (who had married his wife's sister, Julia Louise Langdon). Together Barber and Albright {{participated in the}} paving of Washington, Scranton, and Buffalo. While Albright turned to other ventures, Barber continued with the asphalt business and secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. Barber used the asphalt from Trinidad for paving city streets and by 1900, Barber had laid over 12 million square yards of <b>Trinidad</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement in 70 American cities {{at a cost of}} $35 million.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{of the new}} Tacoma Narrows Bridge (TNB) {{included}} a steel orthotropic bridge deck. The higher flexibility of an orthotropic deck causes pavement placed upon it to fatigue and crack more quickly than pavement placed on a normal roadway. The HMA overlay placed on the new bridge incorporated <b>Trinidad</b> Lake <b>Asphalt</b> (TLA) to help resist the stresses of an orthotropic deck. The basis of this report is to evaluate the short and long-term performance of the HMA overlay with TLA binder used on the TNB. This report provides background information on orthotropic bridge deck overlay construction practices and documents {{the construction of the}} overlay on the TNB. Annual summary reports {{over the next five years}} will document any changes in the performance of the overlay. A final report will summarize performance characteristics and future recommendations for use of this process. 17. KEY WORDS 18.

5000|$|In 1878, {{he became}} {{actively}} involved with asphalt pavement {{work with his}} brother-in-law John J. Albright, a Buffalo industrialist. In 1880, Barber partnered with U.S. Senator John Sherman for the purchase and sale of the [...] "Stone" [...] property, then {{on the outskirts of}} Washington D.C. This led to an interest in asphalt for paving city streets, after a government study determined it to be the best available method. He incorporated Barber Asphalt Paving Co. in 1883 to produce asphalt, and in 1887, secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. He was also managing director of Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co., Limited, incorporated in London in 1898. Barber moved the Washington-based business to New York City, and it continued to expand, becoming, against Barber's wishes, part of an asphalt trust. By 1900, he had laid over 12 million square yards of <b>Trinidad</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million. [...] Barber retired from the business in 1901, just before the trust collapsed, but returned to the industry in 1904.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{was founded}} circa 1881 as the Limmer & <b>Trinidad</b> Lake <b>Asphalt</b> Company with the {{objective}} of undertaking road contracting using high quality asphalt from Limmer in Germany and from the Pitch Lake in Trinidad. The company was based in Carnwarth Road in Fulham and secured major contracts for surfacing the roads of London. The asphalt was imported and the stone came by barge from Scotland. The Company was acquired by Tarmac in 1971.|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to tame dust and dirt, Pennsylvania Avenue was first paved using the macadam method in 1832, {{but over the years}} other {{pavement}} methods were trialed on the avenue: cobblestones in 1849 followed by Belgian blocks and then, in 1871, wooden blocks. In 1876, as part of an initiative begun by President Ulysses S. Grant to see Washington City's streets improved, Pennsylvania Avenue was paved with asphalt by Civil War veteran William Averell using <b>Trinidad</b> lake <b>asphalt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Promoted to Captain in 1854, he {{was given}} command of HMS Horatio at Sheerness and then of HMS Niger in which he {{took part in the}} {{destruction}} of the Chinese Fleet in October 1856 during the Second Opium War. He later commanded HMS Warrior and then HMS Cumberland. He was appointed Superintendent of Sheerness dockyard in 1869 and Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station in 1873. He retired in 1886. In retirement he was involved in managing the <b>Trinidad</b> Lake <b>Asphalt</b> Company.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{was founded in}} 1851 by the tenth Earl of Dundonald who took out a patent {{for the use of}} asphalt from the Lake at La Brea. J.W. Previte and A.L Barber later joined the team and in 1888 secured a 21-year concession for the exploitation of the Lake. In 1949 the {{business was}} renamed The <b>Trinidad</b> Lake <b>Asphalt</b> Company. Ownership remained with the Previte Company based in the UK which comprised a network approximately 24 public companies around the world through which the asphalt was sold.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of waste cooking oil (WCO) {{on the performance}} characteristics of asphaltic materials indigenous to Trinidad, namely, <b>Trinidad</b> Lake <b>Asphalt</b> (TLA), <b>Trinidad</b> Petroleum Bitumen (TPB), and TLA[*]:[*]TPB (50 [*]:[*] 50) blend, was investigated to deduce {{the applicability of the}} WCO as a performance enhancer for the base asphalt. The rheological properties of complex modulus (G∗) and phase angle (δ) were measured for modified base asphalt blends containing up to 10 % WCO. The results of rheology studies demonstrated that the incremental addition of WCO to the three parent binders resulted in incremental decreases in the rutting resistance (decrease in G∗/sinδ values) and increases in the fatigue cracking resistance (decrease in G∗sinδ value). The fatigue cracking resistance and rutting resistance for the TLA[*]:[*]TPB (50 [*]:[*] 50) blends were between those of the blends containing pure TLA and TPB. As operating temperature increased, an increase in the resistance to fatigue cracking and a decrease in the rutting resistance were observed for all of the WCO modified asphaltic blends. This study demonstrated the capability to create customized asphalt-WCO blends to suit special applications and highlights the potential for WCO to be used as an environmentally attractive option for improving the use of Trinidad asphaltic materials...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid 19 th century, rare prehistoric wooden carvings {{and human}} {{skeletal}} remains have been dredged from Pitch Lake, <b>Trinidad,</b> during commercial <b>asphalt</b> mining. Establishing a chronology for these objects is challenging, due to both {{a lack of}} stratigraphic and contextual information and the necessity to completely remove any pitch to ensure accurate radiocarbon dates. A range of solvent extraction protocols was tested to identify the most suitable one for pretreating the Pitch Lake artefacts, and then applied to ten wooden objects and a human cranium recovered from the lake. Several of these objects yielded earlier dates than expected, raising concerns that pitch had remained after pretreatment and had affected the dates. Pyrolysis-GC/MS and optical microscopy techniques were applied to material from the human cranium, a weaving tool, and a small bowl. These techniques, as well as routinely applied laboratory quality assurance procedures, {{indicated that there was}} no residual pitch within the cranium or the weaving tool after pretreatment, giving confidence to the dates. However, the small bowl was observed to still be contaminated with pitch after extensive pretreatment, indicating that the date is too old and can only be considered as a terminus post quem...|$|R
