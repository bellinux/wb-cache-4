5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E

The Milčinski team concluded that Martinović could have inserted the bottle by positioning it on a stick, which he had pushed into the earth, but had slipped during masturbation and broke the bottle in his rectum under <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body's weight. The Yugoslav secret police and military intelligence reportedly concluded from this that Martinović's injuries had indeed most likely been self-inflicted.|$|E

25|$|Ögedei was {{considered}} to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and very charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own study, {{translation}} and commentary {{of the texts}} of these traditions initiated {{the development of the}} Faxiang school (法相宗) in East Asia. Although the school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding perception, consciousness, Karma, rebirth, etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang's closest and most eminent student was Kuiji (窺基) who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang's logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in Indian logic. Another important disciple was the Korean monk Woncheuk.|$|E

Szigeti held the bow in an old-fashioned way, with the elbow close to the body, and produced much emphatic power, but not without extraneous sounds. Minor reservations, however, were swept aside by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical personality.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of his lifetime, Waugh made enemies and {{offended}} many people; writer James Lees-Milne said that Waugh [...] "was the nastiest-tempered man in England". Waugh's son, Auberon, said that <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's personality was such that, despite his lack of height, [...] "generals and chancellors of the exchequer, six-foot-six and exuding self-importance from every pore, quail in front of him".|$|E

500|$|On 31 March 1856, Calcraft {{executed}} William Bousfield, but {{a threat}} {{he had received}} {{that he would be}} shot on the scaffold unnerved him. After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing, Calcraft ran off, leaving Bousfield hanging; a few moments later Bousfield raised one of his legs to support himself on the platform. Calcraft's assistant tried to push the victim off, but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself. The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold, where he [...] "threw himself around his [...] legs and by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> weight finally succeeded in strangling him". Calcraft's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Christopher Coker, {{professor}} of international relations at London School of Economics, gave a detailed analysis of Smith's opening sentence, [...] "war no longer exists". He concluded that war had metastasised, but that war was not over, and that Smith's [...] "eye-catching quote detracts from <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own argument". Nevertheless, Coker praises Smith for the latter's criticism of those who failed to recognise the shift in the paradigm of war, and of the lack of strategy in the military campaigns of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Coker concludes with the statement: [...] " [...] experience, distilled in a book sometimes too controversial for its own good, should become standard reading in every military academy".|$|E
500|$|As {{commanding}} officer, McCain {{relied upon}} a relatively unorthodox leadership style based upon <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality. [...] He removed personnel he thought ineffective, {{and sought to}} improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men. Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages, he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit. [...] McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly. Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved {{to the point of}} having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal. McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career. When his stint ended in July 1977, the change of command ceremony was attended by his father {{and the rest of his}} family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.|$|E
500|$|McCain and {{his wife}} Carol had been briefly {{separated}} soon after returning to Washington, but then reunited and remained married. In April 1979, while attending a military reception for senators in Hawaii, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, eighteen years his junior, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona and the daughter of James Willis Hensley, a wealthy Anheuser-Busch beer distributor, and Marguerite [...] "Smitty" [...] Hensley. They began dating, travelling between Arizona and Washington to see each other, and John McCain urged his wife Carol to accept a divorce. The McCains stopped cohabiting in January 1980, and John McCain filed for divorce in February, which Carol McCain accepted at that time. After she {{did not respond to}} court summonses, the uncontested divorce became official in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, on April 2, 1980. McCain gave Carol a settlement that included full custody of their children, alimony, child support including college tuition, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her ongoing medical treatments resulting from the 1969 automobile accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980 in Phoenix, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart as best man and groomsman. McCain's children were upset with him and did not attend the wedding, but after several years they reconciled with him and Cindy. Carol McCain became a personal assistant to Nancy Reagan and later Director of the White House Visitors Office. The Reagans were stunned by the divorce; Nancy Reagan's relationship with John McCain turned cold for a while following it, but eventually the two renewed their friendship. The same happened with most of McCain's other friends, who were eventually won over by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality and his frequent expressions of guilt over what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|The group planned attacks worldwide, {{though it}} {{experienced}} internal splintering after its 1983 Orly Airport attack incurred non-Turkish casualties.

[...] Jaime Vega-Curry (deputy editor of ESPN Deportes), said Camacho was [...] "a character that combined a contagious charisma, impressive boxing quality, a child's soul, a salesman's shrewdness, and a superlative confidence on himself and in <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 'Macho Time'" ...|$|E

[...] When his regiment was sent from London to Manchester he immediately resigned his commission, citing the city's poor reputation, undistinguished ambience and want of culture and civility.|$|E
