5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use of poison gas in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

25|$|In Venus's garden, Venus and Adonis {{delight in}} their illicit love. Adonis reclines in Venus's lap, while Chato, Celfa, and the nymphs, sing to the couple. Amor arrives and warns them of Marte's anger. Venus tells Adonis {{to return to}} the forest and plots to subdue Marte. When Marte arrives, the songs of the nymphs and vapors from the garden's fountains induce him to languor. Belona enters {{bringing}} a chorus of soldiers to counteract the spell cast by the nymphs' singing. Revived by the soldiers' songs, Marte heads for the forest looking for Adonis, who is again chasing the wild boar that had alarmed the peasants. Dragging Chato and Celfa off with him, Marte orders Dragón to <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> to a tree. Marte commands Megera, one of the Furies, to make the boar especially vicious, so that Adonis will die. Chato, Celfa, and Dragón have a comic argument about bullies and neglectful husbands, culminating with Dragón beating Celfa as Chato cheers him on.|$|E
25|$|Nelson's work {{revolves}} around a personal language of symbols and archetypes. The {{subjects of the}} paintings change from piece to piece and from project to project but {{the core of the}} work stems from his own personal lexicon of archetypal symbols. Nelson's work from 2000-2010 touches on Chicago Imagism, Funk Art, and outsider art, emphasizing simplified images. The works are rich in materiality. Surfaces are thick with densely saturated pigments and heavily worked with layers of drawing...even the drawings have dimension, with the paper lifting off its backing. As Kathryn M. Davis writes in ArtNews, Nelson’s “sly paintings conjure cartoons, found signage, and modern hieroglyphs, and <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> together with lusciously patinated surfaces. Nelson describes his own process: “The unconscious is like a reservoir. Themes emerge, some that are humorous, others that are cryptic and vague.” His work presents an idiosyncratic slant on the human figure and a psychological take on human nature. Though not wholly human the beings in Nelson's artwork reflect the shifting role of the subconscious self, part animal and part human, part nature and part culture.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{rates for}} methanotrophic mussels at cold seep sites have been {{reported}} (Fisher, 1995). General growth rates {{were found to be}} relatively high. Adult mussel growth rates were similar to mussels from a littoral environment at similar temperatures. Fisher also found that juvenile mussels at hydrocarbon seeps initially grow rapidly, but the growth rate drops markedly in adults; they grow to reproductive size very quickly. Both individuals and communities appear to be very long lived. These methane-dependent mussels have strict chemical requirements that <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> to areas of the most active seepage in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of their rapid growth rates, mussel recolonization of a disturbed seep site could occur relatively rapidly. There is some evidence that mussels also have some requirement of a hard substrate and could increase in numbers if suitable substrate is increased on the seafloor (Fisher, 1995). Two associated species are always found associated with mussel beds – the gastropod Bathynerita naticoidea and a small Alvinocarid shrimp – suggesting these endemic species have excellent dispersal abilities and can tolerate a wide range of conditions (MacDonald, 2002).|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|The goal of Operation Rheinübung (Rhine Exercise) was for Bismarck and {{the heavy}} cruiser —under the command of Lindemann's Crew 1913 classmate Captain Helmuth Brinkmann—to break into the Atlantic and attack Allied shipping. Grand Admiral Raeder's orders to the task force commander—Admiral Günther Lütjens—were that [...] "the {{objective}} of the Bismarck is not to defeat enemies of equal strength, but to <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> down in a delaying action, while preserving combat capacity as much as possible, so as to allow Prinz Eugen {{to get at the}} merchant ships in the convoy" [...] and [...] "The primary target in this operation is the enemy's merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk." ...|$|E
500|$|Blamey relinquished {{command of}} New Guinea Force on 22 September, handing over to Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay. As {{one of his}} final actions before {{returning}} to LHQ in Brisbane, Blamey instructed Herring to arrange for the reinforcement of Finschhafen with an extra brigade and 9th Division Headquarters. That day, though, MacArthur, who also returned to Brisbane on 24 September, had issued an instruction that operations at Finschhafen were [...] "to be so conducted as to avoid commitment of amphibious means beyond those allotted". Barbey therefore declined to arrange for the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Mackay took up the matter with Carpender, who likewise demurred. MacArthur feared that committing additional resources would <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> up, and perhaps result in losses, that would delay upcoming operations, relinquishing the initiative to the Japanese. Ironically, the delay in reinforcing Finschhafen would cause just that.|$|E

500|$|Carroll's first season, 1994, started well. Going into a November {{home game}} against Miami, the Jets were 6–5; {{a victory over}} the Dolphins would <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> for the AFC East lead. The Jets built leads of 17–0 and 24–6, but Dan Marino and the Dolphins cut the lead to 24–21 and got the ball for a final-minute drive. Marino {{completed}} a pass into Jets territory with just over 30 seconds remaining. With the clock running, the Dolphins acted like Marino would spike the ball to stop the clock. However, Marino faked the spike and tossed the ball to Mark Ingram {{in the end zone}} for the winning touchdown. The loss started yet another December collapse; the Jets would not win again {{for the rest of the}} season. Prior to the season finale, the Jets announced that Steinberg was ill with stomach cancer; he died the following September. The team fired Carroll after the season and replaced him with former Philadelphia Eagles coach Rich Kotite. [...] Hess also named Kotite as general manager as well.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the first}} seven episodes of the season {{revolved}} around the characters organizing a harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee and the major cuts threatened to the parks department, which prompts Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake {{the future of the}} entire department on its success and failure. The festival served as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, similar to efforts to turn a construction pit into a park during the first two seasons. Schur said the harvest festival story arc was written in part because the first six episodes were written and filmed early, so the writing staff felt having one concise storyline to <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> together kept the show focused. Schur also said the writers were fatigued from working on six third-season episodes immediately after the second season, so the harvest festival story arc helped [...] "organize our tired, end-of-the-year brains".|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count {{indictment}} that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The National Caucus of Labor Committees was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, [...] "we are going to stall, <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal". Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.|$|E

[...] Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show, calling it an [...] "inefficient...collection of sprawling narrative ideas" [...] and comparing it to [...] " [...] suddenly turn into Darker than Black." [...] Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose [...] "seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica." [...] Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but [...] "disappoints as a work of art." [...] Early on, Ekens described the series as having [...] "sharp comedic timing," [...] and by episode four, she praised the comedic elements as [...] "already much funnier than Plastic Memories." [...] She {{went on to say}} that [...] "it's dumb, but I like it for the same reasons I liked the comedy in [...]" [...] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte unpredictability [...] "engaging" [...] and its animation [...] "beautiful".

500|$|The Final Fantasy VI poem {{follows the}} journey of Terra Branford, [...] "the heroine born with the gift of magic". The poem explores the stages of her life through the game, as she escapes from slavery, faces her amnesia, discovers the source of her powers, and saves {{the world from the}} insane Kefka Palazzo. Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played, and he wanted {{to tell the story of}} the game as it felt to him. Wanamo has {{described}} the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date. Originally, the poem was going to follow the story of the group of heroes, before Wanamo made Terra the focus, and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length. The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not to tell the story of the game, but to express the [...] "continuum" [...] of the series through the lens of the game. While inspired by the game's story, Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than [...] "a series of separate scenes and stories". He feels that a hallmark of Böcker's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works, but instead <b>tie</b> <b>them</b> to a wider creative process. Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game's setting. The first movement, [...] "Nibelheim Incident", follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game; the second, [...] "Words Drowned by Fireworks", explores the relationship between Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough, and Tifa Lockhart; while the third movement, [...] "The Planet's Crisis", depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth. He tried to [...] "bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart" [...] of the game.|$|E
