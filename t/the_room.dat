5|$|It is, however, an {{accurate}} depiction of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in the building}} known today as Independence Hall, {{the centerpiece of the}} Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E

5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing.

Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at the Continental Inn in Lexington {{where he had}} been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Then the player is taken again to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E
5|$|As {{they enter}} <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the man {{stands up and}} holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him fall to the ground. As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers.
