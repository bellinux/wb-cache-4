5|$|With the Gregorian missionaries, a third {{strand of}} Christian {{practice}} {{was added to}} the British Isles, to combine with the Gaulish and the Hiberno-British strands already present. Although it is often suggested that the Gregorian missionaries introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into England, there is no supporting evidence. The early archbishops at Canterbury claimed supremacy over all the bishops in the British Isles, but their claim was not acknowledged by {{most of the rest of}} the bishops. The Gregorian missionaries appear to have played no part in the conversion of the West Saxons, who were converted by a missionary sent directly by Pope Honorius I. Neither did <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> lasting influence in Northumbria, where after Edwin's death the conversion of the Northumbrians was achieved by missionaries from Iona, not Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to most intestinal helminthiases, where the heaviest parasitic loads tend {{to occur in}} children, hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males. The explanation {{for this is that}} hookworm infection tends to be occupational, so that coworkers and other close groups maintain a high prevalence of infection among themselves by contaminating their work environment. However, in most endemic areas, adult women are the most severely affected by anemia, mainly because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> higher physiological needs for iron (menstruation, repeated pregnancy).|$|E

25|$|As {{a protest}} against the {{interference}} of the Anglican Church {{in the affairs of}} the Puthankoor faction of the Malankara Church, the Metropolitan, Cheppad Mar Dionysius, convened a Synod at Mavelikara on 16 January 1836. There it was declared that Malanakara Church would be subject to the Syrian traditions and Patriarch of Antioch. The declaration resulted in the separation of the CMS missionaries from the communion with the Malankara Church. However a minority from the Church, who were in favor of the reformed ideologies of the missionaries, stood along with them and joined the CMS. These Syrian Anglicans, were the first reformed group from among the Saint Thomas Christians. In 1879, the Anglican diocese of Travancore and Cochin was established, in Kottayam. On 27 September 1947, a little over a month after the Indian independence, the Anglican Church in South India united with similar other reformed Churches in the region and formed the Church of South India (CSI); an autonomous Indian church within the Anglican Communion. Though the CSI group largely follows the religious practices of their parent groups all the world over, linguistically, socially and culturally <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> in common with the Kerala Syrian Christian groups.|$|E
25|$|While amate {{is made in}} a {{few small}} villages in {{northern}} Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatlán located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself {{is on the side}} of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work. In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a disk galaxy) distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed axial ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Seyfert progression from Typenbsp&I to Typenbsp&II (including Typenbsp&1.2 to Typenbsp&1.9), there are other types of galaxies that {{are very similar to}} Seyferts or that can be considered as subclasses of them. Very similar to Seyferts are the low-ionisation narrow-line emission radio galaxies (LINER), discovered in 1980. These galaxies have strong emission lines from weakly ionised or neutral atoms, while the emission lines from strongly ionised atoms are relatively weak by comparison. LINERs share a large amount of traits with low luminosity Seyferts. In fact, when seen in visible light, the global characteristics of their host galaxies are indistinguishable. Also, they both show a broad line emission region, but the line emitting region in LINERs has a lower density than in Seyferts. An example of such a galaxy is M104 in the Virgo constellation, also known as the Sombrero galaxy. A galaxy that is both a LINER and a Type I Seyfert is NGC 7213, a galaxy that is relatively close compared to other AGNs. Another very interesting subclass are the narrow line Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies (NLSy1), which have been subject to extensive research in recent years. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> narrower lines than the broad lines from classic Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies, steep hard and soft X-ray spectra and strong Fe emission. Their properties suggest that NLSy1 galaxies are young AGNs with high accretion rates, suggesting a relatively small but growing central black hole mass. There are theories suggesting that NLSy1s are galaxies in an early stage of evolution, and links between them and ultraluminous infrared galaxies or Seyfertnbsp&II galaxies have been proposed.|$|E

500|$|The sporocarps are {{functionally}} and developmentally modified leaflets, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> shorter stalks {{than the}} vegetative leaflets. Inside the sporocarp, the modified leaflets bear several sori, {{each of which}} consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue (the indusium). [...] Each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium, each type producing only one of two kinds of spores. [...] Toward {{the center of each}} sorus and developing first are the megasporangia, each of which will produce a single large female megaspore. [...] Surrounding them {{at the edge of the}} sorus and developing later are the microsporangia, each of which will produce many small male microspores.|$|E
500|$|A third type of male {{was first}} {{described}} in 2006; {{this is a}} permanent female mimic, the first such reported for a bird. About 1% of males are small, intermediate in size between males and females, and do not grow the elaborate breeding plumage of the territorial and satellite males, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> larger internal testes than the ruffed males. This cryptic male, or [...] "faeder" [...] (Old English [...] "father") obtains access to mating territories together with the females, and [...] "steals" [...] matings when the females crouch to solicit copulation. The faeder moults into the prenuptial male plumage with striped feathers, but does not go on to develop the ornamental feathers of the normal male. As described above, this stage is thought to show the original male breeding plumage, before other male types evolved. A faeder can be distinguished in the hand by its wing length, which is intermediate between those of displaying males and females. Despite their feminine appearance, the faeders migrate with the larger 'normal' lekking males and spend the winter with them.|$|E

2500|$|Two main {{advantages}} of film capacitors are very low ESR and ESL values.
