60|$|Take, for {{simplest}} and nearest example, {{this question}} of the stress of wind. It is not the actual power that is immeasurable, if only it would stand to be measured! Instruments could easily now be invented which would register not only a blast that could lift a sailing boat, but one that would sink a ship of the line. But, lucklessly--the blast won't pose to the instrument! nor can the instrument be adjusted to the blast. In the gale of which my friend speaks in his next letter, 26th January, a gust came down the hill above Coniston village upon two old oaks, which were well rooted in the slate rock, and some fifty or sixty feet high--the one, some twenty yards below the other. The blast tore the highest out of the ground, peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orange--swept {{the head of the}} lower tree away with it in one ruin, and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over the other's stump, as one would break one's cane over some people's heads, if one got the chance. In wind action of this kind the amount of actual force used is the least part of the business;--it is the suddenness of its concentration, and the lifting and <b>twisting</b> <b>strength,</b> as of a wrestler, which make the blast fatal; none of which elements of storm-power can be recognized by mechanical tests. In my friend's next letter, however, he gives us some evidence of the consistent strength of this same gale, and of the electric conditions which attended it:--the prefatory notice of his pet bird I had meant for 'Love's Meinie,' but it will help us through the grimness of our studies here.|$|E
40|$|The use of beta-solenoid {{proteins}} as functionalizable, nanoscale, self-assembling molecular {{building blocks}} may have many applications, including templating {{the growth of}} wires or higher-dimensional structures. By understanding their mechanical strengths, we can efficiently design the proteins for specific functions. We present {{a study of the}} mechanical properties of seven beta-solenoid proteins using GROMACS molecular dynamics software to produce force/torque-displacement data, implement umbrella sampling of bending/twisting trajectories, produce Potentials of Mean Force (PMFs), extract effective spring constants, and calculate rigidities for two bending and two twisting directions for each protein. We examine the differences between computing the strength values from force/torque-displacement data alone and PMF data, and show how higher precision estimates can be obtained from the former. In addition to the analysis of the methods, we report estimates for the bend/twist persistence lengths for each protein, which range from 0. 5 - 3. 4 μm. We note that beta-solenoid proteins with internal disulfide bridges do not enjoy enhanced bending or <b>twisting</b> <b>strength,</b> and that the strongest correlate with bend/twist rigidity is the number of hydrogen bonds per turn. In addition, we compute estimates of the Young's modulus (Y) for each protein, which range from Y = 3. 5 to 7. 2 GPa...|$|E
40|$|In an {{adiabatic}} rapid passage experiment, the Bloch vector of a two-level system (qubit) is inverted by slowly inverting {{an external}} field {{to which it}} is coupled, and along which it is initially aligned. In twisted rapid passage, the external field is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal angle ϕ (t) {{at the same time that}} it is inverted. For polynomial twist: ϕ (t) ∼ Bt^n. We show that for n ≥ 3, multiple avoided crossings can occur during the inversion of the external field, and that these crossings give rise to strong interference effects in the qubit transition probability. The transition probability is found to be a function of the <b>twist</b> <b>strength</b> B, which can be used to control the time-separation of the avoided crossings, and hence the character of the interference. Constructive and destructive interference are possible. The interference effects are a consequence of the temporal phase coherence of the wavefunction. The ability to vary this coherence by varying the temporal separation of the avoided crossings renders twisted rapid passage with adjustable <b>twist</b> <b>strength</b> into a temporal interferometer through which qubit transitions can be greatly enhanced or suppressed. Possible application of this interference mechanism to construction of fast fault-tolerant quantum CNOT and NOT gates is discussed. Comment: 29 pages, 16 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

Twist and Count variation in a yarn can have considerable {{effect on the}} appearance of the finished fabric, whether woven or knitted. The variability in the strength of a yarn is important in fabric formation. Variation in strength is related to variation of weight per unit length. In this project, an attempt has been made to establish National Norms for <b>Twist</b> and <b>Strength</b> Variation of Cotton Yarn produced in Sri Lanka. The short-term variability of twist is determined very largely by the variation in weight per unit length.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{injection}} moulding, {{long glass}} fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LGFT) are an attractive way to produce large parts at low cost. However {{the strength of the}} part depends chiefly on the average fibre length, fibres which are subjected to considerable attrition during processing in conventional three stage screws. In this study, two models of fibre breakage are considered: The first mechanism is specific to plastication during which a fibre anchored at one end in the solid bed is submitted at the other end to the intense shear existing in the molten film, close to the barrel. The thickness of the molten film and the shear stress applied to the fibre vary with polymer viscosity, fibre strength and dimensions, and process parameters. As the melting of the solid bed progresses, more fibres are unlayered and submitted to bending. When the bending stress applied exceeds the fibre strength, the fibre breaks. This results in bimodal fibre length distributions. The sensibility of the model to main processing parameters such as screw rotation, initial fibre length, viscosity, barrel temper-ature and screw geometry is also investigated. The second mechanism addresses the fibre breakage occurring at a later stage in the process, when the screw channel is completely filled with melt. The basis for this {{is to look at the}} fibre as an array of bonded spheres. The flexibility of the fibre model is altered by changing the bending, stretching and <b>twisting</b> <b>strength</b> of the bond connecting adjacent spheres. The motion of the fibre in the flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational motion equations for individual spheres under hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted on them. Again, the fibre fractures at the bond at which the applied stress exceeds the fibre strength...|$|E

40|$|In {{adiabatic}} rapid passage, the Bloch vector of a qubit is inverted by slowly inverting {{an external}} field {{to which it}} is coupled, and along which it is initially aligned. In non-adiabatic twisted rapid passage, the external field is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal angle ϕ(t) {{at the same time that}} it is non-adiabatically inverted. For polynomial twist, ϕ(t) ∼ Bt^n. We show that for n > 3, multiple qubit resonances can occur during a single inversion of the external field, producing strong interference effects in the qubit transition probability.

40|$|Quality is an {{increasingly}} {{important factor in the}} production and marketing of fresh fruit and vegetables. After harvesting, fruit and vegetables are placed in storage for a few days or a few months, serving as a means to extend the season and provide a reserve for more uniform retail distribution. Changes in texture, particularly the development of mealiness, will greatly affect fruit eating quality, and thus its acceptability to consumers. Mealiness occurs extensively in both pome and stone fruits. A special concern in this study was the problem of mealiness measurement of "Braeburn" apples. This cultivar was New Zealand's most popular export apple variety in the June 1996 year, valued at $ 102. 2 million. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the development of apple mealiness and to develop an apple mealiness indicator by (1) providing a detailed review of literature on fruit mealiness, (2) studying the changes in physical properties with the development of apple mealiness, (3) comparing the physical properties of mealy with non-mealy and aged apples, and (4) investigating the relationships between objective tests and subjective tests to develop good mealiness indicators. A review of the literature showed that mealiness was not just the loss of water, but was related to the way water is bound or tied up chemically within the fruit, which can make it difficult to extract. Many studies have been done on the objective measurement of fruit mealiness, but until now there are no good indicators based on fruit physical properties which have been adopted by the fruit industry. Some parameters may be effective for measuring fruit mealiness, such as internal air space, extractable juice, but further research work needs to be done to correlate these parameters with subjective tests, to investigate the correlation with other physical parameters and to monitor changes in values with the development of fruit mealiness. Experimental studies on the effect of storage conditions showed that high temperature hastened apple ripening and mealiness processes. Texture deterioration was a main quality concern in apples stored under high humidity conditions (> 90 % at 20 °C and > 95 % at 0 °C), but shrivel was also a major quality factor in fruit stored at low humidity conditions (< 90 % at 20 °C and < 95 % at 0 °C). By monitoring the physical property changes during the development of apple mealiness, the following results were obtained: Mealy apple density was significantly lower than that of fresh apple. This decrease was mainly affected by the development of apple mealiness. However due to the wide variation in density change, it was not a reliable mealiness predictor. In the initial stage of the experiment <b>twist</b> <b>strength</b> declined with storage time. Thereafter changes were related to humidity conditions. The value of mealy apples was significantly lower than that of aged, shrivelled but not mealy apples. Multiple regression indicated that <b>twist</b> <b>strength</b> change was not only affected by mealiness development, but also by different treatments and apple age, so it was not a suitable mealiness indicator. Elastic modulus changes did not respond well to the development of apple mealiness. When apples shrivelled, elastic modulus declined greatly. Multiple regression results indicated that both apple mealiness development, and apple age affected the change of elastic modulus. Low R 2 values indicated that elastic modulus were weakly related to the treatments, apple age and mealiness development. It could not be used as an apple mealiness indicator. Both compressive energy and fracture strength declined with storage time. Multiple regression results indicated that both changes of compressive energy and fracture strength were not only affected by mealiness development, but were also equally affected by different treatments and apple age, so they were not suitable mealiness indicators. Based on literature studies, shear strength is mainly determined by the strength of the cell wall. Shear gradient declined with storage time and the development of apple mealiness. Multiple regression results indicated that changes of shear gradient were only affected by mealiness development, and so it may be a suitable mealiness indicator. However, the regression coefficient was relatively low (0. 43), and further research work would need to be done to attempt to improve its reliability.

Participants related primes to targets more quickly and accurately when they contained congruent information (speech: "chop"; gesture: chop) than when they contained incongruent information (speech: "chop"; gesture: <b>twist).</b> Moreover, the <b>strength</b> of the incongruence affected processing, with fewer errors for weak incongruities (speech: "chop"; gesture: cut) than for strong incongruities (speech: "chop"; gesture: twist). Crucial for the integrated-systems hypothesis, this influence was bidirectional. Experiment 2 demonstrated that gesture's influence on speech was obligatory. The results confirm the integrated-systems hypothesis and demonstrate that gesture and speech form an integrated system in language comprehension...|$|R
50|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to worsted yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and <b>twist</b> added for <b>strength.</b> There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning worsted yarns is the worsted mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|R
40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of Landolphia buchananii concrete beams to establish the potential of Landolphia buchananii as structural reinforcement of concrete in beams. Tensile strength test on Landolphia buchananii was performed while flexural test was done on Landolphia buchananii reinforced beams and compared with steel reinforced concrete beams. Beams of 1100 mm length having 150 mm width and 250 mm depth {{were used in the}} tests. Varying area of reinforcement of L. buchananii was used for beam specimens made of concrete of average compressive strength of 21. 8 N/mm 2. The steel reinforced beams were reinforced with standard 8 mm High <b>strength</b> <b>twisted</b> bar as a tensile reinforcement. The results showed that the ultimate load for the L. buchananii reinforced beams was lower than that of control beams by about 65 % and therefore L. buchananii can only be used under low loading regimes such as in low rise lintel beams with load bearing walls...|$|R
40|$|The {{in-plane}} shear behaviour of URM wallettes strengthened using {{near surface}} mounted high <b>strength</b> <b>twisted</b> stainless steel reinforcement (TSNSM) was investigated and in particular, {{the effectiveness of}} the reinforcing schemes to restrain the diagonal cracking failure mode was studied. A total of 17 URM wallettes, each being 1. 2 m × 1. 2 m in size, were structurally tested in induced diagonal compression. Of these, 3 wallettes were tested as-built and 14 wallettes were tested after being strengthened using different patterns of TSNSM bars. Several parameters pertaining to the in-plane shear behaviour of strengthened URM walls were investigated, including failure modes, shear strength, maximum drift, pseudo-ductility, and shear modulus. It was inferred from the results that as-built tested wallettes exhibited sudden post-peak strength degradation and failed along a stepped diagonal joint crack, whilst strengthened wallettes failed along distributed diagonal cracks in a more ductile fashion and exhibited a shear strength increment ranging from 114 % to 189 %...|$|R
