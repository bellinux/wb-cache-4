5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>detention,</b> not the lawfulness of <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order <b>the</b> <b>detention.</b> <b>The</b> <b>detention</b> order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E

5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest. He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> order was made.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte {{rejected}} this support: {{the party}} of independence sought to establish a constitutional monarchy headed by Charlotte, but she preferred to retain the power of an absolutist monarchy. Consequently, she denounced the letter and organized <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> of Diego Paroissien. Paroissien, who had several letters to the criollos, was charged with high treason. Castelli was his lawyer.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary {{reported}} that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. <b>The</b> <b>detention</b> of the suspect was extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} was whether {{indefinite}} detention for migration purposes infringed on Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. While every judge discussed this issue, only three judges, Justices McHugh, Hayne and Heydon, {{found it necessary}} to make a final decision on the issue. They all reached the same conclusion, that <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> scheme was constitutional.|$|E

5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the legality of <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> is lawful.|$|E
5|$|At {{its sixth}} annual {{convention}} in Vavuniya on 25 May 1958 ITAK resolved {{to launch a}} non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve its goals. In May and June 1958 Ceylon witnessed anti-Tamil rioting. Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating the violence and banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> order was lifted.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>detentions,</b> <b>the</b> Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler were {{directly}} concerned in policy relating to the Belgian prisoners of war.

5|$|Born in Derby, England, Hickling served from 1941 until 1946 in the British Royal Navy during World War II, {{and then}} joined the Colonial Legal Service. In 1955, Hickling was posted to Malaya (now Malaysia), where he gained {{prominence}} as a lawmaker. He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which provided for <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> of persons without trial. The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said {{was not his}} intention.|$|E

From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison was {{partially}} {{used as a}} military prison during both world wars – for <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> of military personnel, {{as well as an}} internment centre. From 1940 until 1946, it was one of more than 50 military prisons across Australia holding a combined total of more than 12,000 enemy aliens and prisoners of war. Fremantle accommodated up to 400 military prisoners and up to 160 civilian prisoners by October 1945. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942.|$|E

For many years, Singh was chairman of both the Probation Committee which supervises the work of probation officers, and <b>the</b> <b>Detention</b> Board, and vice-president of the National Kidney Foundation Singapore. He was also a member of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Disciplinary Committee for advocates and solicitors.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>detention</b> scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, {{it was not}} punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from a system in which all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board.

The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
