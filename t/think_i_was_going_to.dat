Writers told me, 'Boy, you really gave it to the producers.' Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point. I was indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

60|$|ANN. Yes: I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{at the end}} of my forces. I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to faint.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's right,' rejoined Newman, 'and I of you. I couldn't help coming up, tonight. <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to {{find out}} something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I guess not!" [...] was the panting answer. [...] "But I--I {{sure did}} <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> over there!" [...] And the shipowner's son shuddered.|$|R
2500|$|On February 25, 2007, {{she won the}} Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for {{her role}} in the film. During her {{acceptance}} speech, Hudson said: [...] "Oh, my God, I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win. [...] If my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration." [...] She also concluded her speech by thanking Jennifer Holliday.|$|E
2500|$|On October 30, 2010, WWE held a [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] in Hartford, Connecticut. Vince {{acknowledged}} that the event was held to counter the negative publicity from the Senate race. During the wrestling show, McMahon distanced himself from his wife's political campaign, saying, [...] "Some people may <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> talk about politics today. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. I do encourage you to vote this Tuesday, and while you're voting, feel free to wear a WWE T-shirt. I came out here to simply say thank you. That's what this day is all about. It's about fan appreciation. No one appreciates the fans more than World Wrestling Entertainment." [...] The Connecticut Democratic Party filed an FEC complaint against Linda McMahon's campaign in October, claiming the WWE's [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] was an [...] "illegal campaign contribution". The complaint also cited the taping of [...] "Smackdown in Bridgeport Harbor Yard" [...] on Election Day, claiming it intended to suppress voter turnout in a Democratic-leaning community.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run away? I'll {{stay and}} face him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to insult}} {{my own mother}} and sisters to please any woman's finical prudish notions'? Pray what did Mrs. Poynsett say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absurd, isn't it!" [...] she replied, {{with a weak}} smile. [...] "I'll {{get over}} it directly. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to like Prince Shan, Nigel." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS BEECH. <b>I</b> {{thought that}} <b>was</b> coming! <b>I</b> don't approve of your making love at your time of life; don't you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> to {{encourage}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I did," [...] said Leonidas reproachfully. [...] "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{let her get}} bit? It {{might have}} killed her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must say, Link, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have the}} {{pleasure}} of meeting you so soon," [...] said Dave, {{with a little bit}} of pardonable sarcasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! What! did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> peril {{my life in}} a 'long- shore concern like this?" [...] said he, with a merry laugh, betraying {{infinite}} pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} positively; [...] "you are quite mistaken if you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to sleep. Please exert yourself, Miss Emily--I am {{waiting to be}} interested." ...|$|R
60|$|And when {{it comes}} from lips like those, how eloquent and how liquid it <b>is.</b> And, oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always deceived--I always <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to {{understand}} it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Sapristie, comrade, I {{began to}} <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be kept all night at my post, and that {{everyone}} had ridden {{out with that}} party that started, half an hour ago.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thanks {{enough for}} me to see you look like {{yourself}},' said Markham. 'Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sit still and leave you in the mess you had got yourself into, with your irregularity about keeping your accounts?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Nasmyth made no comment, and Mrs. Acton {{sank down}} a little further into her long chair. [...] "The others are down on the beach," [...] she {{announced}} drowsily. [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep when you made your appearance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I always <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> loved--and then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> let down. You DON'T love me, you know. You don't want {{to serve}} me. You only want yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to die," [...] she said, quietly, [...] "and I can {{understand}} how she feels. It seems such a mockery; but if she wishes it; and Arthur--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In a sense, no," [...] he replied. [...] "Diplomatically, however, <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{from their}} point of view, a heinous offender. <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> shelved for six months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you can't {{imagine how}} much I admire your songs and airs, Mr. Berkeley. I was so pleased when you invited us, to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{lunch with a}} real composer. There's no music I love so much as yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother." [...] Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: [...] "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him {{suppose we}} were piqued at his not coming? Did you suppose I {{was going to}} let him patronize us, or think that we were in the least {{dependent}} on his favor or friendship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{would have}} been a pity,' said Louis, 'for the Viscount is a much more living man than the old troubadour. When he had so many plans of poems for the golden violet that he made none at all, I was quite taken with him. I began to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a lesson.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> killed, or {{something}} like it, probably by that accursed old villain of a witch-doctor, who <b>I</b> don't believe <b>is</b> altogether human." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you intend to do, Gully; but I mean to bolt. If she <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to stick here {{for the next two}} years she is jolly much mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odd's life, m'dear! be reasonable! Do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to allow}} {{my body to}} be made a pincushion of, by every little frog-eater who don't like the shape of your nose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a fuss?" [...] asked Mr. Travers in a {{very low}} voice. [...] "I assure you I would rather go than stay here. You didn't think that? You have lost all sense of reality, of probability. I was just {{thinking}} this evening that I would rather be anywhere than here looking on at you. At your folly. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, {{what does}} she mean?--ain't that damned impertinent?' he stammered. 'What did she <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say? Does she suppose I would say any harm before--before her? Dash it, does she suppose I would give away my wife to the servants?' Then he added, 'And I wouldn't say any harm before you, Laura. You are too good and too nice and I like you too much!' ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{great many}} lovely things {{happened}} to me this Christmas, but if I were to tell Susie of them I am sure she would be frightened out of her bright little wits, and <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a Roman Catholic. I'm writing such a Catholic history of Venice, and chiseling all the Protestantism off the old [...] "Stones" [...] as they do here the grass off steps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and gives}} us {{time to get}} acquainted with the college layout {{and the rest of}} the students," [...] added Tom. [...] "Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to like it bang-up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} you again," [...] she said. [...] "You, too, must {{have time to}} <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to forget this morning, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to forget that I have seen you. You, too, must do the same!" ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, modern rheumatisms {{are not as}} {{interesting}} as the rheumatisms people of the past ages had; but from what I have seen of this town, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to like it very much.|$|R
