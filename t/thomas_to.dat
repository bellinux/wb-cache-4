In 1951 Truman appointed <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council, {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.

5|$|Johnson {{notified}} Congress of Stanton's {{suspension and}} Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act.

5|$|Thomas' {{father was}} prosperous, wealthy {{enough to send}} <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> the University of Bologna in Italy. Thomas was {{recorded}} as Magister ("Master"), i.e. possessing a Master's degree, at Bologna in 1286.

5|$|A few holdouts {{remained}} for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender {{and it was}} first ruled {{for a short time}} by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.|$|E
5|$|A {{park was}} {{established}} {{next to the}} castle; a park was highly prestigious and it enabled <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> engage in hunting, provided the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income. Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed {{to make way for}} the park and the site eventually became a deserted village. A new parish church, St Leonard's Chapel, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th-century church during the construction of the inner court. Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in the newly built St Anne's Chapel, forming the north transept of St Leonard's Chapel.|$|E

He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit {{and that of his}} family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 it {{appointed}} the architect Percy <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> produce designs. He proposed a new American-inspired station that would involve removing or re-siting the arch, and included office frontages along Euston Road and a helicopter pad on the roof. The redevelopment work began on 12 July 1938, when 100,000 tons of limestone was extracted {{for the new}} building and some new flats constructed to rehouse people displaced by the works.

5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford got away from Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His cross into the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes after the hour mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove {{the ball in the}} net. Arsenal continued to pile on pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> score.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{occurred at}} the Thomas gate, where Thomas again commanded the sally in person. After intense fighting, Thomas, seeing {{that there was no}} weakening in the Muslim front, decided that continuing the attack would be fruitless and would lead to even heavier casualties among his men. He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back at a steady pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower of arrows by the Muslims. This was the last attempt by <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> break the siege. The attempt had failed. He had lost thousands of men in these sallies, and could no longer afford to fight outside the walls of the city.|$|E
5|$|By June 30, air {{assets were}} being rallied against ground targets {{as well as}} aircraft. That day the 19th Bombardment Group was being used to bomb targets along the Han River. Meanwhile, the 3rd Bombardment Group bombed targets around Seoul, seeking to slow the North Korean advance southward from the newly {{captured}} city. These assets also attacked North Korean convoys and troop movements along the roads to great effect. During these attacks North Korean aircraft rarely opposed the US aircraft, but in a few occasions Yak-9 flights appeared, and in one instance engaged a flight of F-80s from the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, allowing Lieutenants Charles A. Wurster and John B. <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> score a victory each. In spite of 25 bombing missions in Seoul, however, the North Korean troops were continuing their advance, forcing the US forces to abandon Suwon Airfield.|$|E

5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan <b>Thomas)</b> <b>to</b> cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E

5|$|Highway74 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with Highway3 {{in the community}} of New Sarum, midway between the city of St. <b>Thomas</b> <b>to</b> the west, and the town of Aylmer to the east.

Immediately north of that community, the route curved to the north and was straight for the remainder of its route. The highway continued, entering the village of Belmont, where it intersected a Canadian Pacific Railway line. North of there it crossed the boundary between Elgin County to the south and Middlesex County to the north. North of the county line, Highway74 continued into the community of Derwent. Shortly thereafter, it crossed and interchanged with Highway401 at Exit195.
