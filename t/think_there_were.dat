25|$|They {{were pretty}} good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was a}} saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

500|$|Only {{entering}} two European charts, [...] "Flatline" [...] reached number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart, {{however it}} peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. The group denied allegations {{of it being}} a [...] "flop": [...] "I don't think our song got lost on the radio. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> certain things that happened behind the scenes that couldn't be helped. Our goal was to put a song out that people liked and we think we've done that". They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a [...] "throw-away hit" [...] on the charts." [...] To NME, Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating {{at the time that}} speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Jason Isaacs {{obtained}} {{the role of}} Michael Britten, the central character of the series. Gordon summated {{the premise of the}} character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to expand his fanbase. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> aspects of Lone Star that were more difficult to get a wider, broader audience interested in," [...] he articulated. [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win." [...] The following month, producers approached Laura Allen to play Hannah Britten. Michaela McManus initially received the role of Hannah, but later received the role of Tara instead, whom Allen originally auditioned to play.|$|E
500|$|On 1August 1986, U2 regrouped in Dublin {{to resume}} {{work on the}} album and begin the {{recording}} stage proper. During this more intense phase of the sessions, the group began {{to work at the}} Edge's newly purchased house, Melbeach, in seaside Monkstown. Lanois said of Melbeach, [...] "That was less of a rock 'n' roll room but we made it work. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a lot of headaches, isolating people and having to build baffles around the place." [...] The Edge called the house [...] "more sombre" [...] but said it had a [...] "solid unpretentious quality that seemed to hold the energy in". [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said that most of the record was done there, and that it was the preferred location for mixing. Writing and recording alternated between the two houses and Windmill Lane Studios. In late August during Hurricane Charley, U2 were visited at Danesmoate by Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist of the Band. Robertson was in Ireland to complete his self-titled debut solo album that he had begun with Lanois. Together, U2 and Robertson recorded the tracks [...] "Sweet Fire of Love" [...] and [...] "Testimony", both of which appear on Robertson's album.|$|E

According to Gingrich, [...] "the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone" [...] but instead [...] "wasted weeks trying to get approval from the United Nations instead of Congress" [...] resulting in a change of mission from ousting Gaddafi to one of humanitarian intervention.|$|E
2500|$|This {{game was}} Michigan's worst defeat since 1968 when they lost 50 to 14 at Ohio State. Dennis Dixon {{accounted}} for 368 {{yards and a}} career-high 4 touchdowns. Three touchdowns were thrown to three different receivers for 85, 61, and 45-yard scoring passes on Dixon's way to 292 throwing yards. [...] Dixon also rushed for 76 yards and one touchdown. [...] The Ducks led by 25 at halftime, and faced little opposition in the second half. [...] According to Oregon coach Mike Bellotti the game was a [...] "good win because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some questions about how Michigan was going to bounce back, and whether we would be competitive. [...] I think our players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959. [...] It also gave them a losing streak of four games, the most in four decades. [...] Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said [...] "We have good kids and they're hurting.

2500|$|According to David A.

I remember there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. I recall that he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E

When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots.

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

Fox Chairman Tom Rothman, responding to an interview question regarding the possibility of a third X-Files movie, said in October 2008, [...] "It's really up to Chris , David [...] and Gillian [...] ".

[...] In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft {{to be the most}} faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a [...] "scary vampire film", of which he didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many. [...] "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps. We're {{going to try to do}} our best... and one of the ways we have to do it is be more naturalistic than the graphic novel, because it's very over-the-top," [...] said Slade. [...] There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with click consonants, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland. [...] Slade explained [...] "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent that you would be aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, yes, no, really basic, because that's what vampires do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Harold Faltermeyer {{wrote the}} title song for a German ski movie called Fire and Ice, and thought Summer {{would be ideal}} to sing the song. He decided {{to reach out to}} Summer and, {{although}} she was not interested in singing the song, she was very much interested in working with Faltermeyer again. After a meeting with David Geffen he was on board with the project. Summer's main objective for the album was that it have stronger R influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to Top Gun and Fletch, was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce [...] "Dinner with Gershwin", but he was already busy with another project, so another producer was found. They also substituted a previous recording called [...] "Bad Reputation", songs like [...] "Fascination", fell by the wayside. Geffen had shared the vision of moving Summer into the R market as a veteran artist, but these expectations were not met. Faltermeyer, in a 2012 interview with Daeida Magazine, said, [...] "She was an older artist by then and the label's priority may have been on the youth market. The decision was made afterward by executives who were looking for a radio hit for 1987 and not something the would perhaps last beyond then." [...] The label's President Ed Rosenblatt would later admit: [...] "The company never intended to focus on established superstars". The album All Systems Go, did not to achieve Gold status. The single [...] "Dinner with Gershwin", (written by Brenda Russell), stalled at 48 in U.S., though it became a hit in the UK, peaking at [...] 13.
