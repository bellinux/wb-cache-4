5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would copy the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already <b>test</b> <b>flying</b> the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active electronically-scanned array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Rowland's {{commission}} was terminated in November 1945. Returning to Australia, he resumed his {{studies at the}} University of Sydney and completed his degree, before rejoining the RAAF {{as a member of}} its newly formed Technical Branch in 1947. He was posted to Britain in 1949 to attend the Empire Test Pilots' School. In 1952, he was appointed chief test pilot with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria. Rowland led trial programs that involved many of the Air Force's early jets such as the Gloster Meteor, deHavilland Vampire, English Electric Canberra, and CAC Sabre. Promoted to squadron leader, he earned the Air Force Cross for his <b>test</b> <b>flying</b> achievements; the award was gazetted on 1January 1955. He married Faye Doughton on 20 April 1955; the couple had a daughter, Anni.|$|E

25|$|The British Concorde {{prototype}} G-BSST {{made its}} 22-minute maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, the French prototype F-WTSS had flown from Toulouse five weeks earlier. Most {{of the employees}} of BAC and Rolls Royce, plus a huge crowd, watched from around the airfield. Fairford {{was chosen as the}} test airfield for Concorde because the runway at Filton was rejected for <b>test</b> <b>flying,</b> its length was inadequate and there were problems with the slope, and the first 1000 feet (300 m) of the runway at its eastern (A38) end could not be used. However, from the end of 1977, all <b>test</b> <b>flying</b> on the second production aircraft G-BBDG was done from Filton, following the closure of the BAC Fairford test base.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the manufacture of non-rigid airships, several of the companies were involved in abortive proposals for many other non-rigid and rigid types.

25|$|On 15 May, the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, {{ordered that}} {{resources}} should be {{concentrated on the}} production of five main aircraft types (the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters and the Whitley, Wellington and Blenheim bombers).

50|$|For a {{while he}} earned his living flying passengers, later Taddéoli left Switzerland for Sesto Calende in Italy on the {{southern}} tip of Lago Maggiore where he was hired as test pilot for Savoia in mid-1914. This manufacturer of hydroplanes was the leader in Europe, and the SIAI S.13 seaplane was a bestselling aircraft.

25|$|His <b>test</b> <b>flying</b> was {{instrumental}} in proving the Lockheed P-38 Lightning design. He and chief engineering test pilot Milo Burcham alternated flying dive tests to observe the design's performance at transonic speeds.

25|$|Following {{the high}} speed flights, Waterton joined the Gloster Aircraft Company in September 1946 as a {{development}} test pilot. He became the company's Chief Test Pilot, primarily {{in charge of}} experimental flight testing their new designs, the Meteor family, the experimental Gloster E.1/44, and the delta-wing Gloster GA.5 which entered service as the Gloster Javelin. He also was involved in acceptance <b>test</b> <b>flying</b> on production aircraft.|$|E

In January 1919 Emile Taddéoli was {{pioneering}} again in crossing the Apennine Mountains in a seaplane between Sesto Calende and San Remo. On 12 July 1919, with a passenger on board, he flew from Calende on Lago Maggiore to Lake Geneva in 110 minutes, overflying the Mont Blanc (4695 m) massif in his SIAI S.13.|$|R
