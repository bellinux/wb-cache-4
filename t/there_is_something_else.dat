500|$|To {{continue}} the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. [...] Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated [...] "It {{looks like the}} fans are really into {{the game and the}} atmosphere out <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.|$|E
500|$|To {{find out}} why the curse failed, the Queen turns to Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle), the {{original}} owner of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person {{in the new world}} and promises that she will do anything he asks so long as he says [...] "please." [...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E

2500|$|Wordsworth {{returns to}} the ideas found within the {{complete}} ode many times in his later works. There is also a strong connection between the ode and Wordsworth's Ode to Duty, completed {{at the same time}} in 1804. The poems describe Wordsworth's assessment of his poetry and contains reflections on conversations held between Wordsworth and Coleridge on poetry and philosophy. The basis of the Ode to Duty states that love and happiness are important to life, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> necessary to connect an individual to nature, affirming the narrator's loyalty to a benevolent divine presence in the world. However, Wordsworth was never satisfied with the result of Ode to Duty as he was with Ode: Intimations on Immortality. In terms of use of light as a central image, the ode is related to Peele Castle, but the light in the latter poem is seen as an illusion and stands in opposition to the ode's ideas. In an 1809 essay as part of his Essays upon Epitaphs for Coleridge's journal, The Friend, Wordsworth argued that people have intimations that there is an immortal aspect of their life and that without such feelings that joy could not be felt in the world. The argument and the ideas are similar to many of the statements in the ode along with those in The Prelude, Tintern Abbey, and [...] "We Are Seven". He would also return directly to the ode in his 1817 poem Composed upon an Evening of Extraordinary Splendor and Beauty where he evaluates his own evolving life and poetic works while discussing the loss of an early vision of the world's joys. In the Ode: Intimations on Immortality, Wordsworth concluded that he gives thanks that was able to gain even though he lost his vision of the joy in the world, but in the later work he tones down his emphasis on the gain and provides only a muted thanks for what remains of his ability to see the glory in the world.|$|E
