5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) in relation <b>to</b> <b>Kate,</b> though nearly all occurred {{as the storm}} was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.|$|E
