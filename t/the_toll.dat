5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the report, Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. Pål Kårbø was elected new chairman. At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. <b>The</b> <b>toll</b> changed the operator of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue. <b>The</b> <b>toll</b> collection was scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{surcharge}} increases, <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> in 2012 will be $2.25, or 16 cents per mile. <b>The</b> <b>toll</b> increase proposal drew 221 public comments and opponents outnumbered supporters by about 3 to 1.

5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority raised <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> on the Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, {{while the}} Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate {{criticism from the}} New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were made about <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> machines, {{due to their}} low height and needing the exact amount of <b>the</b> <b>toll.</b> In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned the value of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> road for property tax purposes, {{saying that it was}} worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E

For convenience <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> are kept at round multiples of 10p (<b>the</b> bridge <b>toll</b> is largely paid in cash as card payments were not accepted until mid-2012), but the 13p VAT reduction was not passed on immediately. In 2009, <b>the</b> planned <b>toll</b> for cars {{would have been}} £5.50, as the announcements listed, but <b>the</b> actual <b>toll</b> charged was £5.40. George Osborne, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in March 2015 that <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> would be reduced to £5.40 in 2018, due to VAT being removed when the bridge comes into public ownership.|$|R
5|$|Initially, under <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> {{collection}} {{regime of}} the HRBC, daily traffic was recorded to be {{a minimum of}} 28,000 vehicles and a maximum of 39,000 vehicles in 2000, but fell {{to a maximum of}} around 30,000 vehicles by December 2002, when the management of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> plaza was handed over to a private firm. Subsequently, the daily traffic reached a minimum of 45,000 vehicles and a maximum of 61,000 vehicles by early 2008, against a maximum capacity of 85,000 vehicles per day. The original management of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> revenue collection by HRBC was consequently criticized for corruption and significant loss of revenue.|$|E

5|$|From Exit 4, {{the turnpike}} {{continues}} on a due north course, crossing Slate Creek, {{before coming to}} the Southern Terminal barrier toll plaza, where tickets are issued for all northbound traffic and fares are collected from southbound traffic. The next interchange north of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> plaza is Exit 19 (Wellington), serving US-160, which heads west to Wellington, the county seat of Sumner County, and east to Winfield, the seat of adjoining Cowley County. It is the first of many trumpet interchanges, serving the surface road via a connector road with a toll plaza. When the turnpike first opened, the US-160 interchange was a reversed diamond with four loop ramps, so that all traffic using the interchange had to pass under the bridge and thus through <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> plaza. The new configuration was built c. 1988.|$|E

25|$|Users of {{the canal}} felt that <b>the</b> <b>tolls,</b> which had not altered since 1770, were too high, as the volume of traffic using the {{navigation}} had increased. In order to rectify the situation, a new Act of Parliament was obtained in 1828, which reduced <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> and formalised <b>the</b> 99-year lease of 1777. In 1847, the East Lincolnshire Railway Company obtained an Act which allowed them to purchase the lease of the Louth Navigation, and later the same year, the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) obtained another Act allowing them to purchase or lease the East Lincolnshire Railway and Canal. They held it for the remaining 29 years, as a tactical move to prevent opposition from the existing leaseholders. When the lease came to an end, the General Manager of the GNR {{reported that they had}} kept <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> as high as was legally possible, but suggested that they refrain from renewing the lease. The commissioners were unable to find anyone wanting to bid for <b>the</b> <b>tolls,</b> and collected them themselves until a bidder was found three months later. Although <b>the</b> <b>tolls</b> were lower than they had been under railway ownership, income was satisfactory into the early 1900s.|$|R

5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928.

The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the flow of traffic which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge.
