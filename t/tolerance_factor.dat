40|$|Statistical {{tolerance}} intervals are another tool for making statistical inference on an unknown population. The tolerance interval is an interval estimator {{based on the}} results of a calibration experiment, which can be asserted with stated confidence level 1 −, for example 0. 95, to contain at least a specified proportion 1 −, for example 0. 99, of the items in the population under consideration. Typically, the limits of the {{tolerance intervals}} functionally depend on the <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors.</b> In contrast to other statistical intervals commonly used for statistical inference, the tolerance intervals are used relatively rarely. One reason is that the theoretical concept and computational complexity of the tolerance intervals is significantly more difficult than that of the standard confidence and prediction intervals. In this paper we present a brief overview of the theoretical background and approaches for computing the <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors</b> based on samples from one or several univariate normal (Gaussian) populations, as well as the <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors</b> for the non-simultaneous and simultaneous two-sided tolerance intervals for univariate linear regression.

40|$|Bland and Altman {{described}} approximate {{methods in}} 1986 and 1999 for calculating confidence limits for their 95 % limits of agreement, approximations which assume large subject numbers. In this paper, these approximations are compared with exact confidence intervals calculated using two-sided tolerance intervals for a normal distribution. The approximations are compared {{in terms of}} the <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors</b> themselves but also {{in terms of the}} exact confidence limits and the exact limits of agreement coverage corresponding to the approximate confidence interval methods. Using similar methods the 50 th percentile of the tolerance interval are compared with the k values of 1. 96 and 2, which Bland and Altman used to define limits of agreements (i. e. Formula+/− 1. 96 Sd and Formula+/− 2 Sd). For limits of agreement outer confidence intervals, Bland and Altman’s approximations are too permissive for sample sizes < 40 (1999 approximation) and < 76 (1986 approximation). For inner confidence limits the approximations are poorer, being permissive for sample sizes of < 490 (1986 approximation) and all practical sample sizes (1999 approximation). Exact confidence intervals for 95 % limits of agreements, based on two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors,</b> can be calculated easily based on tables and should be used in preference to the approximate methods, especially for small sample sizes...|$|R

50|$|Amongst the {{transition}} metals, Cr3+ {{is the most}} controversial in terms of nutritional value and toxicity. This controversy centers on whether Cr3+ provides any nutritional benefits given that Cr3+ nutritional supplements for humans {{form the basis of}} a multimillion-dollar industry with sales second behind Ca-containing products. Furthermore, this controversy is amplified by the fact that no Cr-containing biomolecules have had their structure characterized, nor has the mode of action been determined. The first experiment that led to the discovery of Cr3+ playing a role in glucose metabolism proposed that the biologically active form of the metal existed in a protein called glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>factor,</b> however, new evidence suggests that it is simply an artifact obtained from isolation procedures.

40|$|Recent {{in vitro}} and murine in vivo studies have {{identified}} several potential LPS <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors.</b> In this study, {{we describe the}} expression kinetics of these LPS <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors</b> in standardized human endotoxemia models using i. v. LPS bolus administration. Responsiveness to LPS {{as well as the}} expression of potential regulators of LPS signaling were determined in peripheral whole blood. Intravenous LPS administration (4 ng/kg) resulted in peak plasma levels of TNF-alpha at 1. 5 h followed by subsequent peaks of the classic negative feedback inhibitors A 20 and IL- 10 at 2 and 3 h, respectively. Circulating blood monocyte counts decimated during the initial inflammatory response, but normalized in the period between 4 and 8 h post-LPS. The LPS response as determined by ex vivo TNF release per monocyte in whole blood was profoundly decreased at 6 - 8 h post-LPS injection despite cessation of A 20 and IL- 10 expression after 4 h. Analysis of MyD 88 short, IL- 1 R-associated kinase (IRAK) - 1, IRAK-M, ST 2, suppressor of cytokine signaling- 1 and - 3, SHIP- 1, and MAP kinase phosphatase- 1 expression indicated that the observed LPS tolerance was associated with decreased IRAK- 1 and elevated IRAK-M expression in this human model. Interestingly, a lower dose of LPS (1 ng/kg) induced LPS tolerance accompanied with IRAK-M up-regulation but without depletion of IRAK- 1. In vitro studies in whole blood showed that IRAK-M up-regulation by LPS is largely dependent on TNF-alpha. The observed rise of IRAK-M transcription in the human endotoxemia model appeared much greater compared with in vitro-stimulated whole blood. In conclusion, LPS tolerance in human endotoxemia models is associated with IRAK-M up-regulatio...|$|R

30|$|There are two {{variables}} known as tolerance factors denoted as u and v ∈I where I is {{the set of}} integers. Tolerance factors are the design parameters.

The tunable <b>tolerance</b> <b>factor</b> v is considered for different modes of operation. For best detection rate, the v values are 3 and 4. For normal defense, they are 5 and 6. For best false positive rate, they are 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. As different networks do have requirements differently, the tunable parameters help in considering different network conditions. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>factor</b> {{is the amount of}} deviation which is considered appropriate to raise DDoS attack alarm. Based on this, best detection rate, best false positive rate, and normal detection are described here. For best detection rate to be achieved, <b>tolerance</b> <b>factor</b> is set to a low value. It does mean that the range given for normal traffic cluster entropy is less. This will ensure reduction of false negatives and improve detection rate. It can detect all attacks accurately but may consider some normal states as attack states. The best false positive rate is achieved by setting <b>tolerance</b> <b>factor</b> to a high value. In this case, the range used for entropy for classification is broad and thus shows less detection rate and less false alarm rate. When false positive detection increases, attack detection decreases. For normal detection scenario, the threshold value for <b>tolerance</b> <b>factor</b> is set to medium. It balances false negatives and false positives.

The experimental results, obtained using a series of real datasets with different times and different <b>tolerance</b> <b>factors,</b> are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measurement. In addition, extensive experiments are performed to show that the proposed measurement can detect the low-rate DDoS attacks not only in the short and long terms but also for low packet rates and high packet rates.
