25|$|Margin-equity {{ratio is}} a term used by speculators, {{representing}} the amount of their <b>trading</b> <b>capital</b> that is being held as margin at any particular time. The low margin requirements of futures results in substantial leverage of the investment. However, the exchanges require a minimum amount that varies depending on the contract and the trader. The broker may set the requirement higher, but may not set it lower. A trader, of course, can set it above that, {{if he does not}} want to be subject to margin calls.|$|E
25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's {{dividend}} policy. The dividends {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} <b>trading</b> <b>capital</b> there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E

60|$|But the {{proceedings}} of the Directors at that time, though not altogether judicious, were in many respects honorable to them, and favorable, in the intention at least, to the country they governed. For, finding their <b>trading</b> <b>capital</b> employed against themselves and against the natives, and struggling in vain against abuses which were inseparably connected with the system of their own preference in trade, in the year 1773 they came to the manly resolution of setting an example to their servants, and gave up all use of power and influence in the two grand articles of their investment, silk and piece-goods. They directed that the articles should be bought at an equal and public market from the native merchants; and this order they directed to be published in all the principal marts of Bengal.|$|E
60|$|A certain {{portion of}} the {{revenues}} of Bengal has been for many years set apart to be employed in the purchase of goods for exportation to England, and {{this is called the}} Investment. The greatness of this investment has been the standard by which the merit of the Company's principal servants has been too generally estimated; and this main cause of the impoverishment of India has been generally taken as a measure of its wealth and prosperity. Numerous fleets of large ships, loaded with the most valuable commodities of the East, annually arriving in England, in a constant and increasing succession, imposed upon the public eye, and naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing opulence of a country whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space in the commercial world. This export from India seemed to imply also a reciprocal supply, by which the <b>trading</b> <b>capital</b> employed in those productions was continually strengthened and enlarged. But the payment of a tribute, and not a beneficial commerce to that country, wore this specious and delusive appearance.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{a modified}} real business cycle {{model of a}} small open economy such as the Korean economy. The model economy is assumed to produce output with two types of capital: <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> and non¡ⓒtraded capital. Domestic individuals can borrow from the world capital market only by using <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> as collateral, and investment in non¡ⓒtraded capital must be financed by domestic savings. It implies that the capital mobility is partial rather than perfect although domestic residents have free access to the world capital market. By incorporating externalities into the production technology, the model economy is able to generate dynamic path of equilibrium time series solely driven by non¡ⓒfundamental shocks such as animal spirits of investors or self¡ⓒfulfilling expectations if the ratio of <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> to total capital is sufficiently high. The paper shows that the second moment properties of the Korean aggregate data could be reproduced in a modified real business cycle framework where fluctuations are driven only by non¡ⓒfundamental shocks, not by the disturbances to economic fundamentals such as technology. This requires a high value of <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> relative to total capital, {{which means that the}} domestic capital market must be highly integrated with the world capital market. It implies that there exists some critical level of capital mobility beyond which the business cycles of an open economy becomes highly vulnerable to non¡ⓒfundamental shocks such as self¡ⓒfulfilling expectations...|$|R
60|$|The fact is, {{that the}} {{principles}} and economy of the Company's trade have been so completely corrupted by {{turning it into a}} vehicle for tribute, that, whenever circumstances require it to be replaced again upon a bottom truly commercial, hardly anything but confusion and disasters can be expected as the first results. Even before the acquisition of the territorial revenues, the system of the Company's commerce was not formed upon principles the most favorable to its prosperity; for, whilst, on the one hand, that body received encouragement by royal and Parliamentary charters, was invested with several ample privileges, and even with a delegation of the most essential prerogatives of the crown,--on the other, its commerce was watched with an insidious jealousy, as a species of dealing dangerous to the national interests. In that light, with regard to the Company's imports, there was a total prohibition from domestic use of the most considerable articles of their trade,--that is, of all silk stuffs, and stained and painted cottons. The British market was in a great measure interdicted to the British trader. Whatever advantages might arise to the general trading interests of the kingdom by this restraint, its East India interest was undoubtedly injured by it. The Company is also, and has been from a very early period, obliged to furnish the Ordnance with a quantity of saltpetre at a certain price, without any reference to the standard of the markets either of purchase or of sale. With regard to their export, they were put also under difficulties upon very mistaken notions; for they were obliged to export annually a certain proportion of British manufactures, even though they should find for them in India none or but an unprofitable want. This compulsory export might operate, and in some instances has operated, in a manner more grievous than a tax to the amount of the loss in trade: for the payment of a tax is in general divided in unequal portions between the vender and consumer, the largest part falling upon the latter; in the case before us the tax may be as a dead charge on the <b>trading</b> <b>capital</b> of the Company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the necessary conditions for equilibrium indeterminacy {{in a small}} open economy under partial capital mobility. In order to have meaningful transitional dynamics of consumption and capital, I assume that the economy uses two kinds of capital as inputs － <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> and non-traded capital － and households can borrow from foreigners only with <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> as collateral. Non-traded capital must be accumulated out of domestic savings, even with the free access to the world capital market. Benabib and Farmer (1994) argue that a representative agent model such as the standard RBC model requires {{a high degree of}} increasing returns to scale to cause indeterminacy in equilibrium path. Unlike the closed economy model of Benabib and Farmer (1994), equilibrium indeterminacy is shown to arise with a much weaker degree of increasing returns to scale in an open economy environment. This result implies that opening the capital market makes the small economy more vulnerable to the 'animal spirits' of investors. The fact that only the net returns to <b>traded</b> <b>capital</b> equal the world interest rate at all points in time {{plays an important role in}} determining the results...|$|R
