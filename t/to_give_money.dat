25|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the Temple, Rome governed Judea both through a Procurator at Caesarea, which had always been the Roman provincial capital, and through a Jewish Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to charities and study in local synagogues, as well as to pay the Fiscus Iudaicus.|$|E

The service allows people to register <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to charity or collect fundraising donations. BT developed MyDonate with the support of Cancer Research UK, Changing Faces, KidsOut, NSPCC and Women's Aid.|$|E

The Poles were defeated by the Russians and Howe was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to the many, particularly officers, {{who did not want to}} return home and harassed people of neighboring countries, while they were given political refuge and crossed over the Prussian border into Prussia. Dr. Howe undertook to distribute the supplies and funds personally, and while in Berlin, he was arrested and imprisoned, but managed to destroy or hide the discriminating letters to the Polish officers. After five weeks, he was released due to the intervention of the United States Minister at Paris.|$|E

500|$|After Roosevelt's election, {{the nation}} waited with {{anticipation}} for {{the specifics of}} the [...] "New Deal" [...] plan on which he had campaigned. Boddy had no more information than anyone else, but had been impressed by a program called [...] "Technocracy," [...] which proposed replacing politicians with scientists and engineers possessing the technical expertise to coordinate the economy, a scheme that Roosevelt did not advocate. On November 30, 1932, the Daily News printed a huge headline [...] "New Deal Details Bared". The article contained no inside information, and actually did not even mention Roosevelt, but instead outlined Technocracy. He continued to discuss Technocracy for weeks, as the people of Los Angeles, desperate for plausible information from any source, bought copies of the Daily News, even invading the paper's loading dock to get them as quickly as possible. Even after Roosevelt took office, the Daily News trumpeted proposals <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to the nation's citizens, such as Francis Townsend's plan that the federal government give $200 a month to every citizen over age 60. The Daily News also gave space to the [...] "Ham 'n' Eggs" [...] plan whereby the elderly would get checks for $30 every Thursday. Boddy hit the lecture circuit to advocate social credit, another plan for the government to return taxes to the citizenry.|$|E
500|$|The fandom is {{considered}} to be charitable, raising money for a number of different efforts. The Brony Thank You Fund was originally established to create a fan-funded advertisement to air on Hub Network as a thank you to the show's creators in November 2012. The charitable drive far exceeded its goal, with additional funds used <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to provide toys for children through Toys For Tots. The fund has since incorporated in the state of New Hampshire, and successfully registered as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization under United States law. They claim to be the first such media-related fandom to achieve this status. In December 2013, the Fund donated $50,000 to endow an animation scholarship in perpetuity at the California Institute of the Arts. [...] Similarly, a group called [...] "Bronies for Good" [...] ran blood drives and raised over $60,000 during 2012 for charities like the Children's Cancer Association, Room to Read, CureSearch, and Your Siblings. Voice actress Tara Strong has gained help from the fandom for her [...] "Kiki's Cancer Fund" [...] to help the daughter of a close friend who had been diagnosed with a brain tumor, and has stated that the child [...] "wouldn't be alive today without the My Little Pony fans"; raising $100,000 to help [...] however, the girl subsequently died of her illness. Faust enlisted help from the bronies {{to raise money for the}} Wildlife Learning Center in California, with the Center offering to name some of its animals after characters in the show when certain donation levels were raised.|$|E

40|$|Garrett Cullity {{concedes that}} saving a {{drowning}} child from a shallow pond at little cost to oneself is not actually analogous <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> a poverty relief organization like Oxfam. The question then arises whether this objection is fatal to Peters Singer's argument for a duty of assistance {{or whether it}} can be saved anyway. Cullity argues that not saving the drowning child and not <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> organizations like Oxfam are still morally analogous, that is, not <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> organizations like Oxfam is morally nearly as bad as letting the child drown. I argue that Cullity's two arguments for this conclusion, an argument from "transitivity" and an argument from collective responsibility, fail...|$|R

When asked how much money ACORN or other community groups would get, a spokesman for Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank, said, [...] "Absolutely none. All funds would go to state and local governments." [...] Critics also claimed that ACORN's complex organizational structure allowed it to escape public scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|Rictor Norton views {{classical}} Jewish {{texts as}} stressing the cruelty {{and lack of}} hospitality of the inhabitants of Sodom to the [...] "stranger". The people of Sodom were seen as guilty of many other significant sins. Rabbinic writings affirm that the Sodomites also committed economic crimes, blasphemy and bloodshed. One of the worst was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> or even gold ingots to beggars, after inscribing their names on them, and then subsequently refusing to sell them food. The unfortunate stranger would end up starving and after his death, the people who gave him the money would reclaim it.|$|E
2500|$|The Roddick Foundation is an {{organisation}} {{founded by}} Anita Roddick. It gave four grants totalling Â£120,000 between 2009 and 2014 to CAGE, an organisation aiming [...] "to {{raise awareness of}} {{the plight of the}} prisoners at GuantÃ¡namo Bay and other detainees held as part of the War on Terror". The organization has been described as [...] "a front for Taliban enthusiasts and al Qaida devotees that fraudulently presents itself a human rights group". The Network for Social Change gave a non-charitable grant of Â£15,000 in 2008. Both entities agreed to cease funding CAGE {{at the request of the}} Charity Commission, which has expressed concern that funding CAGE risked damaging public confidence in charity. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Governmentâ€™s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: [...] "I would never advise anybody <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>money</b> to CagePrisoners.
