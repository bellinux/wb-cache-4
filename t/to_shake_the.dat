5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E

5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> opponent's hand).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
50|$|Cleaning a mechanical-shaker {{baghouse}} {{is accomplished}} by <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> top horizontal bar from which the bags are suspended. Vibration produced by a motor-driven shaft and cam creates waves in <b>the</b> bags <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off <b>the</b> dust cake.|$|R

50|$|Sullivan {{returned}} to Cambridge on April 1, 1974. Upon taking office, he promised <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> up <b>the</b> city's housing authority and police department.|$|R
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|When {{the chaos}} began <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker {{was out of}} town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} {{that during the}} fight in Connecticut, Giant-Man became enraged when the Wasp was killed by Hobgoblin. This led him to crush Vulture {{with his hands and}} step on Crossbones. As he charged the villains, Avalanche used his {{abilities}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> ground. Moloids emerged and attack Giant-Man, causing him to fall to the ground.|$|E

25|$|In Värend, Sweden, Freyja {{could also}} arrive at Christmas night {{and she used}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> apple trees {{for the sake of}} a good harvest and {{consequently}} people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the plough outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} pay {{television}} in Australia {{resulted in the}} Super League war which was fought {{in and out of}} court during the mid-1990s by the News Ltd-backed Super League and Kerry Packer-backed Australian Rugby League organisations over broadcasting rights, and ultimately control of the top-level professional rugby league football competition of Australasia. This resulted in the greatest and most costly set-piece confrontation <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> corporate landscape of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Every 31 December, 2.5million people {{gather at}} Copacabana Beach to {{celebrate}} New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all {{night at the}} hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds {{to the spirit of}} the festivities.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{was born}} in Scotland, Maryland, in Saint Mary's County, the sixth of 17 {{children}} born to sharecroppers Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub where the children were bathed. Smith says he tried <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> moniker several times, but it stuck incessantly. He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames {{was the last person}} to call him by his proper name, Orlando.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} once {{in the first three}} rounds. They swept the New York Knicks in the first round, then {{eliminated}} the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round. Their much-awaited rematch with the Detroit Pistons in the conference finals showcased the maturity and poise that the Bulls displayed all season, as they swept the injury-riddled Pistons club. In a last show of defiance, most of the Pistons walked off the court with :08 left on the clock in a blowout loss at home so as not to congratulate the new Eastern Conference champions, though Joe Dumars, Vinnie Johnson, and John Salley did remain <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> Bulls' hands.|$|E

25|$|Stage 7 {{was where}} the Enterprise-B's bridge, {{deflector}} room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting. Control panels styled after those in the original Star Trek television series helped suggest {{the age of the}} station.|$|E
25|$|Another word: Before the day שֶׁיָּפוּחַ (sheyafuaḥ), breathes—before {{that day}} the peoples יָפוּחַ (yafuaḥ), expire. And the shadows flee—governments that {{dominate}} them. I will hurry to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense (Song of Songs 4:6). Said the blessed Holy One 'I will betake myself <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> peoples from Jerusalem, the הַר הַמּוֹר (har ha-mor), the mountain of myrrh,' as is written, Jerusalem on הַר הַמּוֹרִיָּה (har ha-moriyah), mount Moriah (2 Chronicles 3:1). And to the hill of frankincense—the Temple that is in Zion, as it is written, Lovely in heights, all the earth's joy, Mount Zion (Psalms 48:3). And it is written, To seize the earth's corners, that the wicked be shaken from it (Job 38:13)—as one holds a garment to shake all the filth from it.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} in North America did nothing <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>the</b> common Whig belief that America {{was to be}} won by defeating France in Europe. However, the failure at Quebec was somewhat compensated by Marlborough's final victory in the field. Anne's Captain-General {{no longer had the}} influence he enjoyed under the Godolphin ministry: his wife's relationship with the Queen had ended acrimoniously and he was now under the influence of Harley, now the Earl of Oxford and Lord High Treasurer. Nevertheless, Marlborough still commanded the Anglo-Dutch forces in northern France, and in August he outmanoeuvred Villars and crossed the formidable Ne Plus Ultra lines, before capturing Bouchain on 12 September. The campaign was not decisive, however. Arras, Cambrai, Le Quesnoy, and Landrecies still stood between the Duke and Paris, and it would take at least one more campaign to secure their capitulation.|$|E
