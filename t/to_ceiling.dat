25|$|The {{most common}} {{instrument}} of torture was the strappado, {{which was a}} simple rope and pulley system. With the pulley attached <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the shoulder joints. To increase the suffering caused by the strappado, weights were attached to {{the feet of the}} victim.|$|E
25|$|The spatial diagram {{created by}} TtEias (1979) {{is very similar}} to the sense of space and {{movement}} created in her earlier Tecelares series woodprints. Like Tecelares, the lines of TtEias (1979)are made with simple materials, include geometric shapes, and create movement through the intersection of lines and the creation of space. So too, there is a human element in the use of materials and the production of the work, in which each thread is pulled taut from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> by hand.|$|E

(The bank subsequently {{moved into a}} new bank building built by H.W. Corbett. The present First National Bank Building at 401–409 SW 5th Avenue, designed by Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston, resembling some of the Lincoln memorial classicism, was built in 1916 when the bank outgrew those later quarters and when it was subsequently under the ownership of H.W.Corbett’s grandsons).|$|E
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E

The Main Library located near Central Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.|$|E

A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage <b>to</b> walls and <b>ceilings.</b> The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> collapse; the center's supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.|$|R
25|$|The crease is {{essentially}} an invisible wall from ice <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> located {{in front of the}} goal mouth and defined by a red semi circle on the ice. Goaltenders are the only players permitted in the crease. If a member of the team with ring possession violates the crease with a stick, skate, arm, etc., the play is stopped and the goalie receives the ring. If any member of the non-possession team violates the crease, their team cannot touch the ring for five seconds (counted by the referee), or possession of the ring is given to the other team.|$|E
25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. From floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is proven}} that CAFS attacks all three {{sides of the}} fire {{triangle}} simultaneously. The foam blankets the fuel, thereby reducing the fuel’s capacity to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres <b>to</b> <b>ceilings</b> and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres <b>to</b> walls and <b>ceilings,</b> shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) ...|$|R

25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E

Furthermore, she had wooden framework with a carvel build, and a elliptical stern.|$|E
25|$|The pier {{today is}} an open structure, with modern {{railings}} on an older base and a deck made of hardwood slats, affording a partial view of the sea below. Along the walkway are name plaques that local people funded to help towards raising the restoration funds. The modern pavilion structure at the pier head was designed by Liverpool architects Shed KM and cost £1.2 million; the building houses a cafeteria with airport style floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows overlooking the beach {{and a collection of}} vintage mechanical amusement machines and penny arcade.

These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically from floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 {{terminal}} {{was built}} in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a single curved terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the airside terminal face at a sharp angle between the old concourses B and C. On the airside of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|President Andrew Johnson had {{the public}} {{rooms on the}} State Floor {{refurbished}} in 1866. His wife, Eliza McCardle Johnson, was in frail health and did {{little in the way}} of entertaining or overseeing the White House. Johnson instead relied on his daughter, Martha Patterson (wife of Senator David T. Patterson). In May, the East Room was cleared of furnishings. Mrs. Patterson oversaw the selection of new yellow wallpaper with a black and gold border, lace curtains, and reupholstered furniture. The ceiling was repainted and frescoes added, and the ceiling centerpieces and cornices were regilded. Only once did Mrs. Johnson intervene, and that was to request that the paint applied <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> be of the highest quality. Patterson also had the three large marble-topped tables removed from the East Room and placed in the family private quarters, and two of the four pier tables added to the Family Dining Room. The East Room was finished in early 1867.|$|E
