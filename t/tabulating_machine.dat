25|$|The <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine</b> is an {{electrical}} device designed {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, Herman Hollerith invented the mechanical <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine,</b> a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 four corporations, {{including}} Hollerith's firm, were amalgamated {{to form a}} fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). Under {{the presidency}} of Thomas J. Watson, CTR was renamed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924. By 1933 The <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company name had disappeared as subsidiary companies were subsumed by IBM.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896 Hollerith {{founded the}} <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company (in 1905 renamed The <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company). Many major census bureaus {{around the world}} leased his {{equipment}} and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies. Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, {{and again in the}} 1900 census.|$|E

2500|$|Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 – November 17, 1929) was an American {{inventor}} {{who developed}} an electromechanical punched card tabulator {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. He was {{the founder of the}} <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company that was [...] amalgamated (via stock acquisition) in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM. Hollerith is {{regarded as one of the}} seminal figures in the development of data processing. His invention of the punched card <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine</b> marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{electric}} {{data processing}} {{was done by}} running punched cards through <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines,</b> {{the holes in the}} cards allowing electrical contact to increment electronic counters. <b>Tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> were in a category called unit record equipment, through which the flow of punched cards was arranged in a program-like sequence to allow sophisticated data processing. [...] Unit record equipment was widely used before the introduction of computers.|$|R
50|$|In 1916 he {{was hired}} as a {{technical}} inspector at the insurance company Storebrand where he came into contact with the <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> of those days.|$|R

2500|$|The bombe was an {{electromechanical}} device whose function was to discover {{some of the}} daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks. Its pioneering design was developed by Alan Turing (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by Harold 'Doc' Keen of the British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. Each machine was about [...] high and wide, [...] deep and weighed about a ton.|$|E
2500|$|An {{explosion}} of new discoveries and inventions took place, {{a process called}} the Second Industrial Revolution. The electric light, telephone, steam turbine, internal combustion engine, automobile, phonograph, typewriter and <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine</b> {{were some of the}} many inventions of the period. New processes for making steel and chemicals such as dyes and explosives were invented. [...] The pneumatic tire, improved ball bearings, machine tools and newly developed metal stamping techniques enabled the large scale production of bicycles in the 1890s. Another significant development was the widespread introduction of electric street railways (trams, trolleys or streetcars) in the 1890s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year, {{electro-mechanical}} devices called bombes were built by British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The bombes' initial design {{was created in}} 1939 at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman. The engineering design and construction {{was the work of}} Harold Keen of the British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. It was a substantial development from a device that had been designed in 1938 by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski, and known as the [...] "cryptologic bomb" [...] (Polish: [...] "bomba kryptologiczna").|$|E

2500|$|The biggest {{employer}} was British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company, later {{merging with}} Powers-Samas to become International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and finally part of International Computers Limited (ICL). [...] At {{one time the}} [...] "Tab" [...] as it was known had occupancy of over 30 factories in Icknield Way (the original pre-Roman Road), Works Road and finally in Blackhorse Road. Blackhorse Road was built on what was {{the continuation of the}} original Icknield Way. Upon building the new ICL building the remains of a large Roman camp was found, many articles being found and saved for display in the Letchworth Museum & Art Gallery. In the Second World War, a number of early computers were built in {{what became known as the}} ICL 1.1 plant.|$|E
2500|$|Bletchley Park's {{commanding}} officer Edward Travis acquired a £100,000 {{budget for the}} construction of Turing's machine, and the contract to build the bombes was awarded to the British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company (BTM) at Letchworth. BTM placed the project under the direction of Harold 'Doc' Keen. Each machine was about [...] wide, [...] tall, [...] deep and weighed about a ton. On the front of each bombe were 108 places where drums could be mounted. The drums were in three groups of 12 triplets. Each triplet, arranged vertically, corresponded to the three rotors of an Enigma scrambler. The bombe drums' input and output contacts went to cable connectors, allowing the bombe to be wired up according to the menu. The 'fast' drum rotated at a speed of 50.4 rpm in the first models and 120 rpm in later ones, when the time to set up and run through all 17,576 possible positions for one rotor order was about 20 minutes.|$|E

Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau. IBM support included customer service and hardware circuit modifications needed to tabulate numbers, create mathematical tables, add, subtract, multiply, reproduce, verify, create tables of differences, create tables of logarithms and perform Lagrangian interpolation, all to solve differential equations for astronomical applications. In January 1940, Eckert published Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation, which solved the problem of predicting the orbits of the planets, using the IBM electric <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines,</b> based on the punched card.
