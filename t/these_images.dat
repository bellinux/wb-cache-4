5|$|The rings were {{investigated}} in detail during the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical imaging, and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries {{relative to the}} Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of <b>these</b> <b>images</b> allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd Galatea.|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{thoroughly}} investigated {{during the}} Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Two new faint rings—λ and 1986U2R—were discovered {{bringing the total}} number then known to eleven. Rings were studied by analysing results of radio, ultraviolet and optical occultations. Voyager 2 observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun, producing images with back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of <b>these</b> <b>images</b> allowed derivation of the complete phase function, geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Two rings—ε and η—were resolved in the images revealing a complicated fine structure. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of Uranus, including the two shepherd moons of the ε ring—Cordelia and Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. <b>These</b> <b>images</b> showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.|$|E
5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though <b>these</b> <b>images</b> are rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, who sits on his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. <b>These</b> <b>images</b> were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over <b>these</b> <b>images</b> and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although <b>these</b> <b>images</b> gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E
5|$|The ba of a god {{was said}} to {{periodically}} leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting <b>these</b> <b>images,</b> the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—"sacred"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could {{come close to the}} gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature.|$|E

Incoherent blurring of experimental HAADF STEM images is a well-known phenomenon. By integrating {{the output of the}} multi-slice HAADF STEM <b>image</b> simulations, <b>these</b> incoherent effects will be less important. Electron dose sensitivity will add an additional uncertainty in the quantification of experimental HAADF images, as will amorphous surface layers and carbon contamination. While other experimental difficulties need to be considered, <b>these</b> <b>image</b> simulation results suggest that for Mo/V-substituted atomic columns, the order of the cations along the beam propagation direction do contribute to measureable differences in integrated HAADF signals from columns of identical composition, limiting the precision of assigning a composition to any particular atomic column.|$|R

5|$|The temple {{building}} was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods {{were believed to}} be present in <b>these</b> <b>images,</b> suffusing the temple with sacred power. Symbols of places in Egypt or parts of the cosmos enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, emblematic of the temple's purpose rather than real events. For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his broader role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.|$|E
5|$|Using RAF aerial photographs, Crawford {{determined}} {{the length of}} the Avenue at Stonehenge before embarking on an excavation of the site with A. D. Passmore in late 1923. This project attracted press attention, resulting in Crawford being contacted by the marmalade magnate and archaeologist Alexander Keiller. Keiller invited Crawford to join him in an aerial survey, financed by Keiller himself, in which they flew over Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire in 1924, taking photographs of archaeological traces in the landscape. Many of <b>these</b> <b>images</b> were published in Crawford and Keiller's Wessex from the Air in 1928. In 1927 Crawford and Keiller helped raise the finances to buy the land around Stonehenge and present it to The National Trust to prevent it from being damaged by further agricultural or urban development. Previously, in 1923, Crawford had assisted Keiller in campaigning to prevent a radio mast being erected on the archaeologically significant Windmill Hill in Wiltshire, with Keiller later purchasing the hill and the surrounding Avebury area. Despite this working relationship, the two never became friends, perhaps a result of their highly divergent opinions and interests outside of archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. <b>These</b> <b>images</b> are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E
