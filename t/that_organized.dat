5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization {{from that of the}} state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group <b>that</b> <b>organized</b> whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E
5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan <b>that</b> <b>organized</b> the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The South Indian {{convergence}} zone spawned a circulation <b>that</b> <b>organized</b> into a tropical {{depression in the}} Mozambique Channel on January9. It gradually intensified while moving to the southwest, developing spiral rainbands. On January11, Elinah passed between Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago. The next day, JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, although land interaction with Mozambique weakened Elinah. After it turned to the south and moved away from the coast, the storm re-intensified, and MFR estimated Elinah reached peak winds of 115km/h (70mph) on January14. Subsequently, the {{convergence zone}} caused the storm to weaken, ultimately absorbing it by January16.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Utor, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, swept through the central Philippines in December2006, {{exacerbating}} the damage left behind by previous Philippine typhoon strikes that year. Residual moisture from the tropical cyclone indirectly contributed to extensive flooding in Malaysia. Utor originated from an area of disturbed weather <b>that</b> <b>organized</b> into a tropical depression on December7 west-southwest of Yap. The cyclone steadily progressed westward while gradually intensifying, reaching tropical storm intensity late on December7. On December9 and the ensuing two days, Utor crossed the central Philippines and reached typhoon strength before weakening somewhat upon entry into the South China Sea. Reintensification ensued afterwards, and Utor reached its peak intensity on December13 with maximum sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) shortly after regaining typhoon strength. However, wind shear and dry air began to take its toll on Utor thereafter, quickly weakening the storm until its dissipation on December15.|$|E
5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} {{of the season}} began as a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>organized</b> into a tropical depression southeast of Cabo Verde early on September8. Initial organization was fast-paced, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Igor six hours after formation. Igor moved west to west-northwest for several days while embedded within the monsoon trough. Increased vertical shear caused the cyclone to temporarily weaken to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September9, but it re-attained tropical storm intensity {{the next day and}} further strengthened to a hurricane by 00:00UTC on September12. After rapid intensification and a subsequent eyewall replacement cycle, Igor attained its peak with maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) by 00:00UTC on September15. Inner core changes continued after peak, and Igor continued as a Category4 hurricane for several days until increased shear and dry air entrainment forced a consistent weakening trend early on September17. The system recurved north-northeast while passing within 60mi (95km) of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane. It eventually made landfall near Cape Race, Newfoundland with winds of 85mph (140km/h) by 15:00UTC on September21 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone three hours later. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger such system between Greenland and Labrador on September23.|$|E
