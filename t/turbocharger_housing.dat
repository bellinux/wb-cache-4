50|$|The Ferrari {{version of}} the engine has a flat plane {{crankshaft}} and dry sump lubrication. In order to obtain equal length pipes, the exhaust manifolds are manufactured from multiple welded cast steel pieces; the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing</b> uses a similar three-piece construction.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} wastegate is {{a built-in}} bypass valve and passage within the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing</b> which allows excess exhaust pressure {{to bypass the}} turbine into the downstream exhaust. Control of the internal wastegate valve by a pressure signal from the intake manifold is identical to that of an external wastegate. Advantages include simpler and more compact installation, with no external wastegate piping. Additionally, all waste exhaust gases are automatically routed back into the catalytic converter and exhaust system. Many OEM turbochargers are of this type. Disadvantages in comparison to an external wastegate include a limited ability to bleed off exhaust pressure due to the relatively small diameter of the internal bypass valve, and less efficient performance under boost conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{parameterization}} {{of variable}} geometry turbochargers for mean-value modeling is typically based on compressor and turbine flow and efficiency maps {{provided by the}} supplier. At low turbocharger speeds, and hence low airflows, the heat exchange via the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing</b> affects the temperature-based measurements of the efficiencies. Therefore, the lowspeed operating regime of the turbocharger is excluded from the supplied maps and mean-value models mainly rely on extrapolation into this region, which is regularly met in emission drive cycles, and hence of significance. This paper presents experimental data from a 2. 0 -liter turbocharged common-rail diesel engine. While the flow maps extend from the high-speed region in a natural way, the efficiency maps are severely affected by the heat transfer effect. It is argued that this effect {{should be included in}} the mean-value model. A physics-based parameterization is suggested for the turbine efficiency, which poses the biggest problems in turbocharger modeling. This new model structure is then validated with transient engine data. ...|$|E

Engine electrification is a critical technology in the promotion of engine fuel efficiency, among which the electrified turbocharger {{is regarded as the}} promising solution in engine downsizing. By installing electrical devices on the turbocharger, the excess energy can be captured, stored, and re-used. The electrified turbocharger consists of a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) and an electric motor (EM) within the <b>turbocharger</b> bearing <b>housing,</b> where the EM is capable in bi-directional power transfer. The VGT, EM, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve all impact the dynamics of air path. In this paper, the dynamics in an electrified turbocharged diesel engine (ETDE), especially the couplings between different loops in the air path is analyzed. Furthermore, an explicit principle in selecting control variables is proposed. Based on the analysis, a model-based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) decoupling controller is designed to regulate the air path dynamics. The dynamics analysis and controller are successfully validated through experiments and simulations...|$|R
40|$|V-band clamp joints {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} to connect circular flanges, for ducts, pipes and the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing.</b> Previous studies and research on V-bands are either purely empirical or analytical with limited applicability on the variety of V-band design and working conditions. In this paper models of the V-band are developed based on the classical theory of solid mechanics and the finite element method to study the behaviour of the V-bands under axial loading conditions. The good agreement between results from the developed FEA and the classical model support the suitability of the latter to model V-band joints with diameters greater than 110 mm under axial loading. The results from both models suggest that the axial stiffness for this V-band cross section reaches a peak value for V-bands with radius of approximately 150 mm across a wide range of coefficients of friction. Also, it is shown that the coefficient of friction and the wedge angle have a significant effect on the axial stiffness of V-bands...|$|E
40|$|The general {{high-temperature}} {{and performance}} limitations of various critical exhaust components (e. g., exhaust valve, exhaust manifold, <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing)</b> used in advanced natural gas reciprocating engine systems (ARES) are being investigated. These baseline data {{will then be}} used to identify cost-effective materials with greater temperature capability and performance for such components. In this study, exhaust valves manufactured from wrought Ni-based superalloy Pyromet 31 V have been examined in both the as-manufactured (fresh) and engine-tested (2400 h of service) condition to discern the effects of long term engine exposure. Service temperatures were estimated for the various valves at 650 – 700 oC. In the as-manufactured condition, the base material of the valve can be described as having a γ matrix that is strengthened by γ ’ precipitates, with M 23 C 6 carbides residing along grain boundaries and MC carbides present within the austenite. After service aging, the alloy is marked by coarsened γ’, increased M 23 C 6 carbide precipitation in grain boundaries, MC carbides, and the precipitation of α-chromium laths within the austenite grains...|$|E
40|$|Turbochargers are key {{components}} of engine air-paths that must be carefully considered during the development process. The combination of fluid, mechanical, and thermal phenomenon make the turbocharger a highly dynamic and nonlinear modeling challenge. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the dynamic response of the turbocharger system across a frequency spectrum from 0. 003 Hz to 500 Hz, i. e., for exhaust gas pulsation in steady state, load steps, and cold start drive cycles, to validate the assumption of quasi-steady assumptions for particular modeling problems. A waste-gated turbine was modeled using the dual orifice approach, a lumped capacitance heat transfer model, and novel, physics-based pneumatic actuator mechanism model. Each submodel has been validated individually against the experimental measurements. The turbine inlet pressure and temperature and the waste-gate actuator pressure were perturbed across the full frequency range both individually and simultaneously in separate numerical investigations. The dynamic responses of turbine housing temperature, turbocharger rotor speed, waste-gate opening, mass flow, and gas temperatures/pressures were all investigated. The mass flow parameter exhibits significant dynamic behavior above 100 Hz, illustrating that the quasi-steady assumption is invalid in this frequency range. The waste-gate actuator system showed quasi-steady behavior below 10 Hz, while the mechanical inertia of the turbine attenuated fluctuations in shaft speed for frequencies between 0. 1 and 10 Hz. The thermal inertia of the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing</b> meant that housing temperature variations were supressed at frequencies above 0. 01 Hz. The results have been used to illustrate the importance of model parameters for three transient simulation scenarios (cold start, load step, and pulsating exhaust flow) ...|$|E

The <b>turbocharger</b> compressor <b>housing</b> had four vanes made from heat resistant Inconel alloy surrounding the turbine wheel (on the inlet side of it) that would fluctuate based on engine load and transmission gearing above 2,000 rpm to allow for increased airflow into the engine as needed.

50|$|An {{external}} wastegate is {{a separate}} self-contained mechanism typically used with turbochargers {{that do not have}} internal wastegates. An external wastegate requires a specially constructed turbo manifold with a dedicated runner going to the wastegate. The external wastegate may be part of the exhaust housing itself. External wastegates are commonly used for regulating boost levels more precisely than internal wastegates in high power applications, where high boost levels can be achieved. External wastegates can be much larger since there is no constraint of integrating the valve or spring into the <b>turbocharger</b> and turbine <b>housing.</b> It is possible to use an external wastegate with an internally gated turbocharger. This can be achieved through a specially designed bracket that easily bolts on and restricts the movement of the actuator arm, keeping it from opening. Another route involves welding the internal wastegate shut which permanently keeps it from opening, but failure of the weld can allow it to open again.|$|R
40|$|Turbochargers are now {{commonly}} used in modern automotive engines, which increase the density of air entering the engine to produce more power. This device not only greatly improves the degree of engine efficiency, but also reduces the pollutant emissions. However, {{one of the important}} issues which must be considered is the noise from turbochargers. This noise can radiate either after propagation through the intake and exhaust ducts or via induced vibrations in the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing.</b> Here the in duct sound will be studied and normally this cause problems mainly on the intake side where there is less silencing available. In particular noise from high frequency tones as well as surge noise phenomena can cause noise problems. The main aerodynamic noise from centrifugal compressors are blade tone noise, buzz-saw noise and flow separation (or surge) noise. For instance the tones occurring at blade passing frequencies can be a problem for large turbochargers,e. g., as found on trucks, where they lie in the range around 10 kHz. The most efficient way to achieve quieter machines is the reduction of the sources, therefore {{it is important to be}} able to measure and investigate the sound generation ofturbo chargers. In this thesis work the sound generated has been investigated using a dedicated turbocharger acoustic test rig. The main purpose is to investigate methods for estimating the in-duct acoustic power using a micro-phone array. Three differen tmodels are proposed to estimate the power in the propagating acoustic modes and to suppress the flow noise. In order to test the proposed methods experiments have been performed on an automotive compressor at four different operating conditions. The results are compared with the literature in order to identify the dominating sound generation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In July of 1999, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was {{undertaken}} between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Solar Turbines, Inc. and Caterpillar, Inc. (Caterpillar Technical Center) to evaluate commercial cast stainless steels for {{gas turbine engine}} and diesel engine exhaust component applications relative to the materials currently being used. If appropriate, {{the goal was to}} develop cast stainless steels with improved performance and reliability rather than switch to more costly cast Ni-based superalloys for upgraded performance. The gas-turbine components considered for the Mercury- 50 engine were the combustor housing and end-cover, and the center-frame hot-plate, both made from commercial CF 8 C cast austenitic stainless steel (Fe-l 9 Cr- 12 Ni-Nb,C), which is generally limited to use at below 650 C. The advanced diesel engine components considered for truck applications (C 10, C 12, 3300 and 3400) were the exhaust manifold and <b>turbocharger</b> <b>housing</b> made from commercial high SiMo ductile cast iron with uses limited to 700 - 750 C or below. Shortly after the start of the CRADA, the turbine materials emphasis changed to wrought 347 H stainless steel (hot-plate) and after some initial baseline tensile and creep testing, it was confirmed that this material was typical of those comprising the abundant database; and by 2000, the emphasis of the CRADA was primarily on diesel engine materials. For the diesel applications, commercial SiMo cast iron and standard cast CN 12 austenitic stainless steel (Fe- 25 Cr- 13 Ni-Nb,C,N,S) baseline materials were obtained commercially. Tensile and creep testing from room temperature to 900 C showed the CN 12 austenitic stainless steel to have far superior strength compared to SiMo cast iron above 550 C, together with outstanding oxidation resistance. However, aging at 850 C reduced room-temperature ductility of the standard CN 12, and creep-rupture resistance at 850 C was less than expected, which triggered a focused laboratory-scale alloy development effort on modified cast austenitic stainless steels at ORNL. Isothermal fatigue testing at 700 C also showed that standard CN 12 was far superior to SiMo cast iron, but somewhat less than the desired behavior. During the first year, 3 new modified CF 8 C heats and 8 new modified CN 12 heats were made, based on compositional changes specifically designed to change the nature, dispersion and stability of the as-cast and high-temperature aging-induced microstructures that consisted of carbides and other precipitate phases. Screening of the alloys at room-temperature and at 850 C (tensile and creep-rupture) showed -a ten-fold increase in rupture life of the best modified CN 12 relative to the baseline material, better room-temperature ductility after aging, caused by less precipitation in the as-cast material and much less aging-induced precipitation. The best new modified CF 8 C steel showed strength at tensile and creep-rupture strength comparable to standard CN 12 steel at 850 C, due to a unique and very stable microstructure. The CRADA was scheduled to end in July 2001, but was extended twice until July 2002. Based on the very positive results on the newly developed modified CF 8 C and CN 12 cast austenitic stainless steels, a new CRADA with Caterpillar has been set up to commercially scale-up, test and evaluate, and make trial components from the new steels...|$|E
