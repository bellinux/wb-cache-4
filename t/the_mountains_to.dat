5|$|A mile {{south of}} the airport, at a signalized {{intersection}} with Old State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the north. A half-mile (1km) beyond that junction, {{at the headquarters of}} the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr {{as the father of}} two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E

5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies up through <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper {{and more efficient}} than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, {{at an average of}} about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E
5|$|In November, Herring flew across <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> {{take control}} of the {{fighting}} around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass enough troops, equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Egypt in 331BC, Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotamia (now {{northern}} Iraq) {{and again}} defeated Darius, at the Battle of Gaugamela. Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him {{as far as}} Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. Darius fled over <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> Ecbatana (modern Hamedan), while Alexander captured Babylon.|$|E

5|$|Overhill Cherokee was {{the term}} for the Cherokee people located in their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, {{on the west side of}} the Appalachian Mountains. This name was used by 18th-century European traders and explorers from British colonies along the Atlantic coast, as they had to cross <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> reach these settlements.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora {{high up in}} <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the south of Cortina testifies {{to the presence of}} Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> escape global warming that accompanied {{the end of the last}} glacial period.|$|E

5|$|The {{villages in}} <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the south, west, {{and north of}} the Salmas Plain were {{generally}} smaller, and accounted for {{about half of the}} total number of villages that were lost. The foreshock was not felt at Borusliqalan (the westernmost village that was destroyed) and the losses were high. The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia (and to the southwest of Tabriz) where the village of Mamaqan was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed. Other nearby villages went almost unscathed, with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type.|$|E
5|$|This {{force was}} then {{guided by the}} Ephesians through <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unaware, {{and were able to}} capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a {{significant}} force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with the Greeks, forcing them back. The Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> the west of the ACT {{as a result of the}} Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E

5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with dairying and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported. Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire.|$|E
5|$|Following the colonists' retreat, an emboldened Ferguson {{dispatched}} a paroled prisoner across <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> warn the colonists to cease their opposition or Ferguson would lay waste to the countryside. Angered by this act, Shelby and John Sevier began to plan another {{raid on the}} British. Shelby and Sevier raised 240 men each, and were joined by William Campbell with 400 from Washington County, Virginia and Charles McDowell with 160 men from Burke and Rutherford counties in North Carolina. The forces mustered at Sycamore Shoals on September 25, 1780. The troops crossed the difficult terrain of the Blue Ridge Mountains and arrived at McDowell's estate near Morganton, North Carolina, on September 30, 1780. Here, {{they were joined by}} Colonel Benjamin Cleveland and Major Joseph Winston with 350 men from Surry and Wilkes counties.|$|E
