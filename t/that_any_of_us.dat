500|$|Cooper {{said the}} band members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E
2500|$|Organizers {{compared}} the February protest with the SOPA protest two years prior, saying, [...] "Today {{we face a}} different threat, one that undermines the Internet and the notion <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> live in a genuinely free society". The threats were 'International counterparts like Five Eyes and Tempora, mass surveillance, and programs such as PRISM, Canada's CSEC airport monitoring activities'.|$|E
2500|$|A joint {{committee}} of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Department of Inter-religious Affairs of the Anti-Defamation League obtained {{a version of the}} script before it was released in theaters. They released a statement, calling {{it one of the most}} troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document Nostra aetate, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ... Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, The Passion of the Christ retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.|$|E

60|$|In an {{incredibly}} short time the whole consignment was delivered; {{and the men}} departed with a douceur for each, given through their foreman, which made them effusive in their thanks.

50|$|One peer-reviewed {{research}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>any</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>US</b> farm policies on US obesity patterns {{must have been}} negligible. However, some critics argue that the artificially low prices resulting from subsidies create unhealthy incentives for consumers. For example, in the USA, cane sugar was replaced with cheap corn syrup, making high-sugar food cheaper; beet and cane sugar are subject to subsidies, price controls, and import tariffs that distort the prices of these products as well.|$|R
