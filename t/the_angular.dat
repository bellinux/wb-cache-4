5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> velocity varies with latitude. Typically <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than the Sun, to have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E
5|$|The tip of <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> is {{situated}} {{close to the}} midpoint of the bone in K. langenbergensis rather than being at the back as in K. guimarotae. In both species, the back of <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> contributes to the retroarticular process. The inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> is roughened in K. guimarotae, and the top margin of the inner wall transitions from an upward-projecting tip at the front to a low, rounded crest at the back; the same margin maintains its height along <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> in K. langenbergensis. The surangular bears a thin, forward-projecting process that, in K. langenbergensis, extends forward {{to the back of the}} tooth row and bears a groove on the bottom. The presence of the oval-shaped external mandibular fenestra is unique to the genus among atoposaurids.|$|E

50|$|Due to the spin-orbit {{interaction}} in the atom, <b>the</b> orbital <b>angular</b> momentum no longer commutes with the Hamiltonian, {{nor does the}} spin. These therefore change over time. However <b>the</b> total <b>angular</b> momentum J does commute with the Hamiltonian and so is constant. J is defined throughL being <b>the</b> orbital <b>angular</b> momentum and S the spin. <b>The</b> total <b>angular</b> momentum satisfies <b>the</b> same commutation relations as orbital angular momentum, namelyfrom which followswhere Ji stand for Jx, Jy, and Jz.|$|R
5000|$|Angular {{frequency}} (or <b>angular</b> speed) is <b>the</b> {{magnitude of}} <b>the</b> vector quantity <b>angular</b> velocity. <b>The</b> term <b>angular</b> frequency vector [...] is sometimes {{used as a}} synonym for <b>the</b> vector quantity <b>angular</b> velocity.|$|R
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism that}} causes differential rotation is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries a portion of <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> {{motion of}} a star about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>angular</b> {{value of}} the {{obliquity}} is found by observation of the motions of Earth and other planets over many years.

Because S=1/2 for electrons, one often {{sees this}} formula written with 3/4 {{in place of}} S(S+1). The quantities gL and gS are other g-factors of an electron.|$|R
5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.|$|E
5|$|With the {{presence}} of various orbiters, landers, and rovers, {{it is possible to}} practice astronomy from Mars. Although Mars's moon Phobos appears about one-third <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> diameter of the full moon on Earth, Deimos appears more or less star-like, looking only slightly brighter than Venus does from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple formula for <b>the</b> {{radiated}} <b>angular</b> momentum {{based on a}} spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of the Weyl scalar psi_ 4 representing outgoing radiation in the Kinnersley tetrad.

5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>angular,</b> which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.

5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, <b>the</b> <b>angular</b> bone and the articular bone.|$|E
