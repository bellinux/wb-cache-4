5|$|The film {{ends with}} Abraham's narration, {{examining}} <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified or not.

5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E

They are also used between teachers and teacher trainers to provide professional development opportunities and improve teaching.|$|E
25|$|A severe anoxic {{event at}} the end of the Permian would have allowed sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} to thrive, causing the production of large amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic ocean.

25|$|Because of {{the horrors}} that Antonio's {{brothers}} {{experienced in the}} war, {{none of them are}} able to integrate themselves back into the quiet life of Guadalupe; Antonio describes them as “dying giants” because they can no longer cope with <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> they left behind when they went to war. Their decision to leave Guadalupe is indirectly linked to their experiences in the war. The impact of modernization and war, therefore, did not exclude the Hispanos and indigenous peoples of New Mexico as the boundaries of their previously insular communities were crossed by these external technological and cultural influences.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, Téchiné took on {{biography}} with Les sœurs Brontë The Bronte Sisters (1979). A {{profile of}} the famous Brontë sisters. The film’s heavy, repressive mood evokes the harshness and injustice of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> the Brontë sisters endured. The passion and color that is so vivid in their novels was absent from their daily existence, and the film’s appropriately gloomy cinematography – which uses dreary earth colors to emphasize the cold, remote feel – evokes this with great poignancy. The film features an all-star cast: Isabelle Adjani, Marie-France Pisier and Isabelle Huppert as Emily, Charlotte and Anne Brontë, with Pascal Gregory as their ill-fated brother Branwell.|$|E
25|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> {{covers the}} surface of the Earth depends {{directly}} or indirectly on photosynthesis. The most common form, oxygenic photosynthesis, turns carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into food. It captures the energy of sunlight in energy-rich molecules such as ATP, which then provide the energy to make sugars. To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product. Some organisms, including purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, use an anoxygenic form of photosynthesis that uses alternatives to hydrogen stripped from water as electron donors; examples are hydrogen sulfide, sulfur and iron. Such extremophile organisms are restricted to otherwise inhospitable environments such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents.|$|E

500|$|Miguel {{sought to}} {{reintroduce}} himself artistically with the album.

He explained the album's title as [...] "a metaphor for our life; everyone has their own Kaleidoscope Dream, it is <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> they project and it is <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> they are solidifying with their conscious decision and their subconscious feelings." [...] Miguel {{also said that the}} album represents the fantasies that are conveyed through dreams, which he felt embody [...] "the purest form of fantasy we unleash through our subconscious ... the truest freedom we can experience. Totally unrepressed and totally creative." ...|$|E

After spending much of the 1950s and '60s in family attics—Zelda's mother even had much of the art burned because she disliked it—her work has drawn the interest of scholars. [...] Exhibitions of her work have toured the United States and Europe. A review of the exhibition by curator Everl Adair noted the influence of Vincent van Gogh and Georgia O'Keeffe on her paintings and concluded that her surviving corpus of art [...] "represents {{the work of a}} talented, visionary woman who rose above tremendous odds to create a fascinating body of work—one that inspires us to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> might have been." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{discussion}} of the track listing in Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard revealed that [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] stretched the [...] "limits" [...] for them and explained {{that it was a}} [...] "jazz-lounge anti-war song". The band also explained that the song is a narrative of a young soldier named Jimmy, from New Jersey, who is killed in the Iraq war. Other songs such as [...] "Down on My Head", [...] "City of Devils", and [...] "Holly Wood Died", had a theme that spoke about bitterness and disillusionment. [...] "How I Go" [...] is based on both lament of a father over <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> has flowed past him and the 2003 film, Big Fish. Another song, [...] "Words, Hands, Hearts", is written about the events that occurred during the September 11 attacks.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{physically}} released {{as a single}} in the United States and Canada. The promotional version, released in both countries, includes an extended and a shortened version of [...] "Jubilation". The main United States edition features B-side track [...] "Everything's Been Changed", another song written by Anka. [...] "Jubilation", along with other tracks on the album, is primarily a gospel song. The track was written by Anka and Johnny Harris, with the latter musician solely producing it. It was mastered by Robin C. Kruse and recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City during 1972. In the lyrics, the protagonist preaches and discusses religious themes: [...] "Sinners take the key / For <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> you lead is deceiving / Nothing replaces a man / That embraces believing, no".|$|E

500|$|On 6 November 2015, Apple Records {{released}} a new deluxe {{version of the}} 1 album in different editions and variations (known as 1+). Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin. Giles Martin, with Jeff Lynne also remixed [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] to accompany the music video for the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The remix of [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] cleans up Lennon's vocal further, and uses a different take of Harrison's vocal phrase, replacing the lyric [...] "whatever happened to <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> we once knew" [...] with [...] "whatever happened to love that we once knew". Towards {{the end of the}} track, this version also contains a clip of Lennon stating the phrase [...] "turned out nice again" [...] played forward—which was played backwards in the original mix of the song. McCartney's lead vocal, buried in the original mix to serve as a double-track for Lennon's own vocal, can now [...] be heard more prominently in the second verse.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} what would become Annie Hall was {{developed}} as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project on alternate days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on {{a man in his}} forties, someone whose life consisted [...] "of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that [...] "advancing age" [...] and [...] "worries about death" [...] had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his [...] "commercial side". Allen made the conscious decision to [...] "sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings". He recognized {{that for the first time}} he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama 8½, created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{said that}} [...] "Born Free" [...] was [...] "an intense episode {{that brought the}} Ice Truck Killer story to a {{satisfying}} conclusion." [...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season will be just as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all they had to do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E
