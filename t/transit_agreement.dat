2500|$|In 1998, Gazprom and Naftohaz made a {{contract}} under which Gazprom {{would pay for}} the transit of volumes of gas, which established a link between gas prices and transit tariffs, but this contract did not resolve the issue of already incurred gas debts.

Gazprom also claimed that Ukraine's gas debt had reached $2.8billion. In 2001, Deputy Prime Minister Oleh Dubyna acknowledged that in 2000 alone [...] of Russian natural gas had been diverted from export pipelines.

The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the <b>Transit</b> <b>Agreement</b> (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the United Nations, in September 1973. The two German states exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East German head of state Erich Honecker paid an official visit to West Germany.|$|E

The two most extensively studied commercial <b>agreements</b> are <b>transit</b> and peering; however, {{they are only}} two of many diverse and continuously evolving commercial agreements that ISPs enter into. So far, the only known practical safe and robust routing policy is Gao and Rexford 2 ̆ 7 s policy guideline, which is applicable to <b>transit</b> and peering <b>agreements</b> only. It is, therefore, of importance to identify routing policies that are safe and robust {{and at the same}} time capable of accommodating the diverse commercial agreements existing in the Internet. In particular, this paper investigates the extent to which routing policies can be devised to accommodate complex mutual <b>transit</b> <b>agreements.</b> We propose a series of policy guidelines that allow mutual <b>transit</b> <b>agreements</b> with progressively broader semantics to be established. Those policy guidelines guarantee routing safety and robustness as long as the AS graph satisfies a corresponding set of precise topological constraints.

50|$|A {{great deal}} of the {{complexity}} in the BGP routing protocol exists to aid the enforcement and fine-tuning of peering and <b>transit</b> <b>agreements.</b> BGP allows operators to define a policy that determines where traffic is routed. Three things commonly used to determine routing are local-preference, multi exit discriminators (MEDs) and AS-Path. Local-preference is used internally within a network to differentiate classes of networks. For example, a particular network will have a higher preference set on internal and customer advertisements. Settlement free peering is then configured to be preferred over paid IP transit.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple game theoretic model of two Internet access providers who choose between peering and <b>transit</b> <b>agreements.</b> There is no regulation {{with regard to}} interconnection policies of providers, {{though there is a}} general convention that the providers peer if they perceive equal benefits from peering, and have transit arrangements otherwise. In the literature there is a debate whether the large providers gain and exploit market power through the terms of interconnection that they offer to smaller providers. In this paper we develop a game theoretic model to examine how providers decide who they want to peer with and who has to pay transit. The model discusses a set of conditions, which determine the formation of peering and <b>transit</b> <b>agreements.</b> The model takes into account the costs of carrying traffic by peering partners. Those costs should be roughly equal for the providers to have incentives to peer, otherwise the larger provider believes that the smaller provider might free ride on its infrastructure investments. The analysis suggests that the providers do not necessarily exploit market power when refusing to peer. Moreover, Pareto optimum is achieved under transit arrangements only. The paper argues that the market forces determine the decisions of peering and transit, and {{there is no need for}} regulation to encourage peering. Furthermore, to increase efficiency, the regulators might actually need to promote transit arrangements...|$|R
50|$|At first glance, these {{principles}} appear noncontroversial {{in terms of}} standards regarding {{the freedom of the}} network. However, {{these principles}} do not address regulations with respect to the issues of differentiations in pricing, interconnection, and QoS. Further, the unregulated forms of net bias have the potential to create false congestion by the ISPs. More specifically, advanced Internet protocol technology can allow ISPs to fabricate congestion and drop packets when no real congestion takes place. In addition, existing peering and <b>transit</b> <b>agreements</b> between stakeholders such as small and large ISPs may lack a specific prohibition of deliberate packet loss.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The Valiant Load-Balancing (VLB) {{design has}} been {{proposed}} for a backbone network architecture that can efficiently provide predictable performance under changing traffic matrices [1]. In this paper we show that the VLB network has optimal performance when nodes can fail, {{in the sense that}} it can support the maximal homogeneous flow for any number of node failures. We generalize the VLB design to enable interconnection of multiple VLB networks, and study interconnection via bilateral peering agreements as well as <b>transit</b> <b>agreements.</b> We show that using VLB as a transit scheme yields the lowest possible network and interconnection capacities, while VLB peering can also achieve near-optimal use of capacity.
