It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E

25|$|Nkunda's rebels {{had been}} active in Nord-Kivu, a {{province}} bordering Lake Kivu in {{the east of the}} Democratic Republic of Congo, since 2004, when they occupied Bukavu and allegedly committed war crimes. The aim of Nkunda's troops was to protect the Tutsi minority, which were believed to lack adequate protection against further genocidal attacks by the Hutus, who were, in turn, believed by Nkunda to have benefited from government support during the Second Congo War. Earlier, in January 2008, Nkunda's rebels had participated in peace talks; at one point <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> saying that other parties had attempted to arrest a member, but later returned. The talks ended with the rebels being granted immunity in exchange for withdrawing troops and allowing civilians to resettle.|$|E
25|$|During the shootout, police {{continued}} to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying {{to flush out}} the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left {{from the rear of}} the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall came out of the house. Investigators working for their parents would claim that <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire. After Hall's body fell to the ground, it was pulled back inside the burning house by Angela Atwood. Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice in the back. Her body remained outside the house.|$|E
500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E
