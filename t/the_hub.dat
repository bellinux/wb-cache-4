5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> eventually closed in 1995.

40|$|The {{enterprise}} application software industry is currently undergoing profound changes. The well-established, large providers (hubs) are fostering partner networks with small complementors (spokes). This paper takes {{the perspective of}} these spokes and seeks to understand their motivations for partnering. Drawing on research on dynamic capabilities and complementarity, an explanatory model of the spokes’ motivation to partner is developed. It is argued that partnering is especially attractive for smaller organizations when it enables them to access <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> complementary commercial, technological, and social capital. The model is empirically examined through a post hoc analysis of 17 small enterprises. The study reveals that <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> reputation {{as part of its}} social capital as well as its commercial capital indeed act as reasons to participate in partnership networks. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> technological capabilities may be seen as a double-edged sword. While <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> capability to provide integrated systems was found to be a prime reason for partnering, its innovative capability may actually detain spokes from partnering. The negative influence of <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> innovativeness, however, was found to be contingent upon the type of solutions offered by <b>hub</b> and spoke. <b>The</b> same holds true for the positive effect of <b>the</b> <b>hub’s</b> commercial capital...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{extension}} of <b>the</b> capacitated single-allocation <b>hub</b> location problem is considered in which the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>hubs</b> {{is part of the}} decision making process and balancing requirements are imposed on the network. The decisions to be made comprise (i) the selection of <b>the</b> <b>hubs,</b> (ii) <b>the</b> allocation of the spoke nodes to <b>the</b> <b>hubs,</b> (iii) <b>the</b> flow distribution through the sub network defined by <b>the</b> <b>hubs</b> and (iv) <b>the</b> capacity level at which each hub should operate. In the latter case, for each potential hub, a set of available capacities is considered among which one can be chosen. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the setup cost for <b>the</b> <b>hubs</b> as well as the flow routing cost. Economies of scale are assumed for the costs. Balancing requirements are imposed to the network. In particular, a value is considered for the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum number of spoke nodes that are allocated to <b>the</b> <b>hubs.</b> Two mixed-integer linear programming formulations are proposed and analyzed for this problem. The results of a set of computational experiments using an off-the-shelf commercial solver are presented. These tests aim at evaluate the possibility of solving the problem to optimality using such a solver with a particular emphasis to the impact of the balancing requirements. The tests also allow an analysis of the gap of the bounds provided by linear relaxation...|$|R
