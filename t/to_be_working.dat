Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried out there, and jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E

These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff {{said that they would}} not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E

5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E

It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

Estianty was reported in October 2010 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on a cover album which featured works originally sung by Nike Ardilla, Hetty Koes Endang, and AtiekCB. Later that year she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women's Issues.

5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> until Chef stops by and sings to the animals {{with a little help from}} Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the second}} series was delayed several times. While Adams was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on scripts for a stage {{adaptation}} of Hitchhiker's in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for Doctor Who and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for Not the Nine O'Clock News. The recording {{on the first day}} scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at Brønnøysund Airport and used a helicopter to freight {{the pieces of the}} wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone made it difficult to hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
