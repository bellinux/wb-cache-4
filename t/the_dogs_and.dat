5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> crew {{had to be}} first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il-14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they {{were placed in the}} capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.|$|E
5|$|Dog expert Cecil Meares {{was going}} to Siberia to select <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> <b>and</b> Scott ordered that, while he was there, he should deal with the {{purchase}} of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work. Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{was focused}} on canine {{interactions}} in public spaces. One hundred canine dyads was observed. The gender of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> affected to stop <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> before <b>the</b> meeting. The gender of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> affected <b>the</b> initiation of sniffing. The gender of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> owner {{had an effect on}} the first location of sniffing. The gender of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had an effect on the last location of sniffing. The age of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> use of leash had an effect on canine play. In conclusion, the results indicate that canine interactions are influenced by a number of factors...|$|R

5|$|Lemmons {{was full}} of impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, {{painters}} and inventors; even <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> cats shared a communal basket, and there were always stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling.

5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E
5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, {{as well as the}} more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technology}} based {{solution for}} calming separation anxious dogs is a software named Digital Dogsitter.The user first records {{his or her}} voice to the software.

Whenever <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> barks or howls, software plays the owner's voice to <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> becomes calm.|$|R

5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for <b>the</b> <b>dogs),</b> <b>and</b> took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring {{his face in the}} process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.|$|E

25|$|In Hong Kong, <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>and</b> Cats Ordinance was {{introduced}} by the British Hong Kong Government on 6 January 1950.

Four local men were sentenced to 30 days imprisonment in December 2006 for having slaughtered two dogs.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Field and Stream {{magazine}} {{put into}} writing what {{was already a}} well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing {{from the field and}} an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.|$|E

25|$|Buck's next {{owners are}} {{a trio of}} stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at {{surviving}} in the Northern wilderness. They struggle to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes {{him to be a}} remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with the butt of his axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs.|$|E

When trading with natives, Wallis' men accepted the offerings of hogs and cloth but untied <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> turned them loose, an act that confused the Tahitians.|$|E

500|$|In both cases, apologies {{from the}} congressman followed. In certain instances, his remarks only {{exacerbated}} his existing problems.

[...] In 2013, he compared the Tea Party movement to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: [...] "It is the same group we faced in the South with those white crackers and <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough." ...|$|E
500|$|As winter {{gave way}} to spring, the party {{prepared}} for more ambitious inland journeys using <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> sledges. However, their base camp was {{cut off from the}} continent's interior by high mountain ranges, and journeys along the coastline were frustrated by unsafe sea ice. These factors severely restricted the extent of their exploration, which was largely confined to the vicinity of Robertson Bay. Here, a small island was discovered, [...] which was named Duke of York Island, [...] after the expedition's patron. A few years later this find was dismissed by members of Scott's Discovery Expedition, who claimed that the island [...] "did not exist", but its position has since been confirmed at 71°38′S, 170°04′E.|$|E
500|$|Believing that Shackleton might {{attempt a}} {{crossing}} {{during the first}} season, Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay, one at 79°S near Minna Bluff, a prominent Barrier landmark, and another further south at the 80° mark. These were, in his view, the minimum that would enable Shackleton's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier. [...] The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for acclimatisation for <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> for the untrained men, and this led to differences of view about how to proceed. Ernest Joyce, {{by far the most}} experienced Antarctic traveller in the party, favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week. Joyce claimed that Shackleton had given him independent control over sledging activities, a view rejected by Mackintosh and later demonstrated as without foundation.|$|E
