5|$|Extending {{the work}} of Vesalius into {{experiments}} on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries.

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> these mystics.|$|E

5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} prosperity in Somerset.

John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 but found that methods could still be improved.|$|E
5|$|The dodo, and its extinction, {{was more}} typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past. Like many species that {{colonise}} remote islands with few predators, it {{lost much of its}} predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> this species and all the other island forms that have become extinct.|$|E

5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It {{was the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.|$|E

5|$|In the 1969–70 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool {{played against}} {{struggling}} Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1–0 {{after a very}} poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, {{in the case of}} Heighway, from non-league football. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal sky marshal program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E

5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, {{that light}} tanks were a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete.

5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to traditional ways of life that had endured for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden marked the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war saw <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> many of {{the older}} vessels, not least the two {{remaining}} Invincible-class ships.

She was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921, and scrapped in Germany the following year. Mount Inflexible in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} was {{not quite}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> Linois' squadron: the last survivor, the frigate Sémillante had originally been ordered to sail for Mexico in March 1805. This plan was foiled by an encounter with the British frigate HMS Phaeton in the Philippines, and Captain Léonard-Bernard Motard returned to the Indian Ocean, operating {{for the next three}} years against British shipping from Île de France. Eventually the old frigate was assessed as worn out and sold from service in 1808, operating as a privateer for a year before she was captured in 1809. Napoleon refused to exchange Linois for a British prisoner, and the Emperor's fury at the admiral's failures in the Indian Ocean prevented any subsequent appointments. In 1814, after Napoleon's abdication, the new French regime made Linois governor of Martinique, but when the Hundred Days began, Linois declared for Napoleon and the British invaded and captured his island. His career over, Linois retired. He died some 34 years later, in 1848.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 {{the deal with}} Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company {{produced}} just one feature film that year, Women Without Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling {{in the face of}} competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>for</b> Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.|$|E
