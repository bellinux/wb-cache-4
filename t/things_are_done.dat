25|$|The {{architectural}} form which cathedrals took was largely dependent upon their ritual {{function as the}} seat of a bishop. Cathedrals are places where, in common with other Christian churches, the Eucharist is celebrated, the Bible is read, the Order of Service is said or sung, prayers are offered and sermons are preached. But in a cathedral, in general, these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> with a greater amount of elaboration, pageantry and procession than in lesser churches. This elaboration is particularly present during important liturgical rites performed by a Bishop, such as Confirmation and Ordination. A cathedral is often the site of rituals associated with local or national Government, the Bishops performing the tasks of all sorts from the induction of a mayor to the coronation of a monarch. Some of these tasks are apparent in the form and fittings of particular cathedrals.|$|E

De Lancie felt that the episode never explained Q's motivation for wanting to stay with Vash. [...] "I think Q is best used when he deals with large philosophical issues, and skirt chasing just isn't one of them", he said. Because certain aspects of Q's character are left unexplored, De Lancie found that [...] "the style, the quips and the panache in which <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> become very important".|$|E

But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done,</b> they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E
500|$|For Ursula Franklin, {{technology}} {{is a set of}} practices in the [...] "here and now" [...] rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive system. [...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in which we all live," [...] she writes, [...] "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of the here and now. [...] "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E

All the priests, and after them the bishop, preach, always taking for their subject {{that part of the}} Gospel where Joseph and Mary brought the Lord into the Temple on the fortieth day, and Symeon and Anna the prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, saw him, treating of the words which they spake when they saw the Lord, and of that offering which his parents made. And when everything that is customary has been done in order, the sacrament is celebrated, and the dismissal takes place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodoret writes [...] "Malachi {{teaches us}} how, when Antichrist shall presume on these things, the great Elias shall appear, {{preaching to the}} Jews the coming of Christ: and he shall convert many, {{for this is the}} meaning of, [...] "he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children," [...] i. e., the Jews (for these he calls fathers, as being older in knowledge) to those who {{believed}} from the Gentiles. They who shall believe through the preaching of the great Elias, and shall join themselves to the Gentiles who seized the salvation sent to them, shall become one church. He hints, how when these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> by Antichrist, Michael the Archangel will set all in motion, that Elias should come and foreannounce the coming of the Lord that the then Jews may obtain salvation." [...] And on this place, [...] "Knowing well, that they would neither obey the law, nor receive Him when He came, but would deliver Him to be crucified, He promises them, in His unspeakable love for man, that He will again send Elias as a herald of salvation, 'Lo, I will send you Elias the Tishbite.' And signifying the time, He added, 'Before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come:' He named the Day of His Second Coming. But He teaches us, what the great Elias shall do, when he comes, 'Who shall bring back the heart of the father to the son' etc. And pointing out the end, for which Elias should first come, 'Lest I come and smite the earth utterly.' For lest, finding you all in unbelief, I send you all to that endless punishment, Elias will first come, and will persuade you, O Jews, to unite you indissolubly with those, who from the Gentiles believe in Me, and to be united to My one Church." ...|$|E
2500|$|With her pending {{nomination}} to become Administrator of the Small Business Administration, examination of McMahon's record {{in preparation for}} her facing United State Senate confirmation began. Among other media attention she received in December was from the Wall Street Journal which noted that, [...] "s part of her 2012 campaign, [...] economic plan called for getting rid of 'outdated/ineffective and duplicative programs,' and expressed support for a 2012 proposal by President Barack Obama to merge the SBA, the Commerce Department's core functions and four other entities into one unit". The merger proposal, which did not proceed far toward approval at the time, would have eliminated the Cabinet-level post to which McMahon is now nominated. The Connecticut Post of Bridgeport, Connecticut examined issues of potential conflicts of interest from remaining WWE stock holdings and other financial assets {{as well as of}} the relationship between WWE and smaller businesses in the wrestling world, with critics and supporters cited. A commentary at the Washington Post looked more generally at how to consider [...] "wrestling as an art form" [...] and credited WWE—despite many deaths of retired athletes at relatively young ages—with a better record on CTE and other athlete health issues than the NFL. The Hill provided a venue for two industry representatives to specify how they hoped McMahon would reform the agency she's been tapped to lead. Huffington Post examined child sexual abuse cases at WWE/WWF in the early 1990s that the nominee took a direct role in addressing. One led to a cash settlement with a disclaimer of guilt.

2500|$|The {{writings}} of the early church contain strong condemnations of same-sex acts. Tertullian wrote, [...] "When Paul asserts that males and females changed among themselves the natural use of the creature in that which is unnatural, he validates the natural way”. Ambrosiaster wrote, “Paul tells us that these things came about, that a woman should lust after another woman, because God was angry at the human race because of its idolatry. Those who interpret this differently {{do not understand the}} force of the argument. For what is it to change the use of nature into a use which is contrary to nature, if not to take away the former and adopt the latter, so that the same part of the body should be used by each of the sexes in a way for which it was not intended?... It is clear that, because they changed the truth of God into a lie, they changed the natural use (of sexuality) into that use by which they were dishonored and condemned". John Chrysostom wrote, [...] "No one can say that it was by being prevented from legitimate intercourse that they came to this pass or that it was from having no means to fulfill their desire that they were driven to this monstrous insanity... What is contrary to nature has something irritating and displeasing in it, so that they could not even claim to be getting pleasure out of it. For genuine pleasure comes from following what is according to nature. But when God abandons a person to his own devices, then everything is turned upside down.” Cyprian wrote, [...] "If you were able... to direct your eyes into secret places, to unfasten the locked doors of sleeping chambers and to open these hidden recesses to the perception of sight, you would behold that being carried on by the unchaste which a chaste countenance could not behold. You would see that it is in an indignity even to see... Men with frenzied lusts rush against men. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> which cannot even give pleasure to those who do them.” ...|$|E
