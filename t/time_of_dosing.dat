40|$|Sulphadimidine {{alone is}} of little value in {{treating}} experimental toxoplasmosis in rabbits, because most rabbits acetylate the drug very rapidly. Within a short <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosing</b> such animals, {{there is little or}} none of the uncombined drug in the blood. In rabbits which do not acetylate sulphadimidine rapidly, relatively high concentrations of the free sulphonamide can be attained in the blood: in such animals, toxoplasmosis responds to treatment with sulphadimidine. Sulphathiazole is not acetylated so rapidly and is effective even in rabbits which acetylate sulphadimidine quickly.

40|$|Introduction: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) or Bechterew’s disease, is a chronic, {{inflammatory}} rheumatic disease, which mainly {{affects the}} axial skeleton and the sacroiliac joints. When conventional treatment with physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is insufficient, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) blocking agents can be considered. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) {{have shown that}} TNF-α blocking agents are effective in reducing the {{signs and symptoms of}} AS. However, the use of TNF-α blocking agents has its limitations concerning the high costs and the possible side effects. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether <b>dose</b> reduction <b>of</b> TNF-α blocking agents based on expert opinion is possible in AS patients. Methods: This retrospective study included AS patients who had started <b>dose</b> reduction <b>of</b> TNF-α blocking agents based on expert opinion at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) and Medical Centre Leeuwarden (MCL). These patients were divided into two groups: group 1 consisted of patients with stable AS and/ or low disease activity and group 2 of patients with other reasons <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction, including side effects. The number of AS patients maintaining on dose reduction was investigated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Besides, the extent <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction was investigated. The mean survival <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction during the entire follow-up was analyzed, as well as data regarding disease activity, physical function and quality of life of patients who succeeded in dose reduction. Results: Between November 2005 and January 2011, 89 AS patients (group 1 n¬= 60, group 2 n= 29) treated with TNF-α blocking agents had started with dose reduction based on expert opinion. In total 74 %, 58 %, 49 % and 43 % of the patients maintained on dose reduction at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. The median extent <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction was 40 %. Comparable percentages and extent <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction were found in group 1 and 2. The mean survival <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> reduction was 33 months.

First-generation PPIs may also fail to provide 24 -h suppression of gastric acid, and noctural acid breakthrough can occur even with twice-daily dosing.

Patients and methods Data were analysed from an open-label, observational study in which patients were treated with 0. 4 mg tamsulosin once daily for 12 weeks. Treatment effects were determined using the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index, the quality-of-life question of the International Prostate Symptom Score, a similarly phrased question about sexual satisfaction, the maximum urinary flow rate, the postvoid residual urine volume, and the overall efficacy and tolerability. The results were analysed statistically for differences between dosing times, using analysis of covariance for the quantitative variables and logistic regression for the qualitative variables. Results While no specific recommendation about the dosing time was given in the trial, the retrospective analysis showed that 4420 and 2087 patients received tamsulosin in the morning and evening, respectively. Both groups had similar values for all variables before treatment. The efficacy and tolerability of tamsulosin treatment was also similar in both groups; there were small advantages for morning dosing, which were statistically significant because there were many patients.

Methods We hypothesized that the terminal portion of the isotope decay curve following an oral dose of isotopically labeled 3 MH can be measured non-invasively from timed spot urine samples. We investigated the feasibility of this approach by determining isotope enrichment in spot urine samples and corresponding plasma samples and whether meat intake up to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosing</b> influences the isotope decay.

Animals were thus subjected to a restricted feeding period. Results indicate that time-restricted feeding schedules displace the peak and the trough of gentamicin-induced renal toxicity, as evaluated by changes in the inhibition of sphingomyelinase activity, cellular regeneration (incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into DNA of renal cortex), and blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, as well as histopathological lesions observed after 10 days of treatment. In fact, the toxicity was minimal when gentamicin was injected during the feeding period, while the maximal toxicity was found when gentamicin was administered during the fasting period.

Half the growing heifers were dosed {{two to three times}} between the ages of 10 and 22 months, with the other half left undosed as controls. The dosed heifers were each given controlled release capsules, designed to deliver 200 to 250 mg/day of Rumensin over 150 days or 300 mg/day over 100 days. The heifers were managed to grow at about 0. 6 to 0. 7 kg/day until first calving. They were weighed every two months while body condition scores and wither heights were recorded at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosing.</b> Following calving, about half of each treatment group were dosed with a further Rumensin capsule, with the remainder undosed. Milk yields and milk composition were monitored throughout the first lactation. Rumensin treatment had few significant effects on the performance of growing heifers. In two studies, Rumensin increased liveweight gain and body condition for parts of the growth phase. In one study, treated heifers attained heavier pre-calving liveweights (466 v 437 kg at 22 months of age) while in another, they were younger at first calving (727 v 739 days). Rumensin had no effects on yields of milk or milk solids, or on milk composition in any study, either during early lactation or over the first lactation. A combined analyses of entire lactatio...|$|E
30|$|The {{contrast}} sensitivity depends for DDA on the used integration time and X-ray tube setting used for {{acquisition of the}} radiographic images. An increased exposure <b>time</b> or <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> the DDA allows or increase the {{contrast sensitivity}} to values higher than reachable with industrial films [3, 10].|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and {{toxicity of}} six week courses of vancomycin were assessed prospectively in 12 chronic hemodialysis {{patients who had}} 17 episodes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Patients were treated with 1 gram <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> vancomycin at weekly intervals for six weeks. Peak serum vancomycin concentrations ranged from 5. 5 - 40. 0 micrograms/ml and trough concentrations were 1. 0 - 12. 0 micrograms/ml at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>dose.</b> No patients demonstrated important drug accumulation at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the fifth <b>dose.</b> Pure tone audiometry demonstrated no auditory toxicity. Flushing and pruritus (two patients) were only adverse effects noted. In 16 episodes blood cultures were sterilized within 48 hours of therapy. This investigation demonstrates that in chronic hemodialysis patients with S. aureus bacteremia vancomycin is a safe and microbiologically effective antimicrobial agent. Peak and trough serum concentrations vary widely when 1 gram doses are given at one week intervals, and thus {{it is recommended that}} concentrations be measured for each patient, particularly if the minimum bactericidal concentration of vancomycin for the clinical isolate is greater than 1. 0 microgram/ml...|$|R
30|$|The {{radiation}} dose for a chest DTS exam using a dedicated wall-mounted flat panel is around 0.12 mSv {{for a typical}} acquisition of 60 projections [26]. In our experiment, however, only 15 DTS projections were taken at 90 kVp and 0.1 mAs. The effective <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 0.029 mSv corresponds to approximately 1.5 <b>times</b> the <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> a portable CXR, obtained at 90 kV and 1 mAs.|$|R
