5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the north wall window. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To {{the right side of the}} altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> {{it is said to}} be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
