40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} <b>tricresylphosphate</b> (TCP) was studied in vitro and in vivo on the rat liver and brain enzymes {{acetylcholinesterase}} (ACC), butyrylcholinesterase (CHE), arylesterase (ARE), aliesterase (ALI), and the microsomal nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH 2 -oxidase) system. The results show that, {{in the male}} rat,TCP givenintraperitoneally induces an increase in liver microsomal ARE and NADPH 2 -oxidase {{and a decrease in}} ALI and cholinester-ase; no activation ofARE and NADPH 2 -oxidase is observed in female rats. It is now generally accepted that the reaction of organophosphate esters with esterases is the same process that occurs when such enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of their substrates (Aldridge and Barnes, 1961, 1966; Aldridge and Reiner, 1972). Inhibition of aliesterase (ALI) after treatment with triortholylphosphate was demonstrated by Dubois (1972) and the toxicity of another phosphoric ester, malathion, appeared to be increased when ALI activity was low. The aim {{of the present study was}} to establish whether <b>tricresylphosphate</b> (TCP) can affect micro-somal enzymes in rat liver and brain. The activity of rat serum was considered together with microsomal nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent (NADPH 2 -dependent) oxidase and non-specific esterases. The effect of n-hexane administra-tion, alone or with TCP, was also studied because n-hexane is a volatile organic solvent widely employed in the same type of technological processes in which TCP is used...|$|R

The materials were selected for their relevance to MEMS applications. About 3 – 5 monolayer-thick organophosphate films are observed to form readily on both silicon and OTS-treated silicon.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{concentrated}} {{high molecular weight}} narrow distribution polystyrene solutions were investigated using a sliding plate rheometer. An in-depth study of the wall slip of these solutions had to be conducted to determine the range of conditions where this phenomenon occurred. It {{was found that the}} critical stress for the onset of slip depends {{on the surface of the}} substrate. Step strain experiments allowed the determination of the ratio of the second to the first normal stress difference, which was found to have values of up to $-$ 2. Gradients in the normal stress differences are believed to be the cause of an observed secondary flow. Large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments were carried out over a wide range of frequency and strain rate amplitude making it possible to construct response surfaces. All three solutions revealed a linear plateau that extended to higher strain rate amplitudes as the frequency increased. It was also found that the loss modulus has a maximum at the onset of nonlinear behavior. The higher harmonics describe the solutions' nonlinearity, and it was found that their qualitative behavior mirrors that of the first harmonic. The effect of molecular weight was assessed for the <b>tricresylphosphate</b> solutions. It was found that the principal harmonic exhibits the expected behavior; as the molecular weight increases, the elasticity of the solution increases. The higher harmonics followed no clear trend. The Doi-Edwards theory and Wagner model were compared to experimental data for all solutions, and both models fell short in quantitative predictions, the Doi-Edwards theory being worse due to its relaxation spectrum. Optical measurements on the <b>tricresylphosphate</b> solutions allowed the determination of the third normal stress difference in LAOS. It was found that the magnitude was independent of molecular weight. However, the "higher" harmonics were found to be dependent on molecular weight. As molecular weight increases, they extend to higher frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption {{measurements}} of <b>tricresylphosphate</b> (TCP) on high-purity iron and chromium surfaces {{have been performed}} in ultra-high vacuum with a quartz crystal microbalance in conjunction with Auger electron spectroscopy, yielding values for gas uptake rates, molecular slippage, and tribofilm stress levels in the temperature range 25 – 400 C. At room temperature, TCP uptake is observed {{to be limited to}} two layers of intact molecules that are likely to be physisorbed. Above 200 C, the data recorded on both iron and chromium substrates are consistent with far greater uptake levels and extensive interdiffusion of TCP fragments with the substrate. The most noteworthy difference between the two substrates is TCP’s fragmentation upon impact on iron, but not chromium, at elevated temperatures.

40|$|An ester {{lubricant}} {{base oil}} containing {{one or more}} standard additives to protect against wear, corrosion, and oxidation was used in an experimental ball/plate elastohydrodynamic contact under load and speed conditions such as to induce scuffing failure in short times. Both the ball and the plate were of identically treated M- 50 steel. After various periods of operating time the wear track on the plate was examined with an interference microscope of plus or minus 30 A depth resolution and sometimes also with a scanning ellipsometer and an Auger spectrometer. The optically deduced surface profiles varied with wavelength, indicating the presence of surface coatings, which were confirmed by the other instruments. As scuffing was approached, a thin (approximately A) oxide layer and a carbide layer formed in the wear track in particular when <b>tricresylphosphate</b> antiwear additive was present in the lubricant.

40|$|<b>Tricresylphosphate</b> (TCP) [(CH 3 C 6 H 4 O) 3 PO] is {{the most}} {{commonly}} tested vapor phase lubricant and is readily available as a mixture containing all three isomers (ortho-, meta-, and para-) of the cresyl groups. The surface chemistry of ortho-, meta- and para-TCP on Fe foil was studied {{in order to examine}} the possible differences in decomposition mechanisms among the isomers. All three TCP isomers decomposed by the same reaction mechanisms and with roughly the same kinetics on Fe. Upon heating, they decomposed on the Fe surface to deposit carbon and phosphorous and produce gas phase H 2, CO, toluene and cresol. The amounts of carbon and phosphorous deposited onto the Fe surface by TCP (arylphosphate) decomposition were compared to those deposited by decomposition of tributylphosphate (TBP), an alkylphosphate. Thermal decomposition of all three TCP isomers deposits sub-stantial amounts of carbon ono the Fe surface while TBP decomposition does not. We suggest that it is the lack of -CH bonds in the methylphenoxy intermediates and the high reactivity of the tolyl intermediates generated during TCP decomposition are the primary reasons for the differences in behavior of TCP and TBP and the root cause of the differences in behavior of arylphosphates and alkyphosphates as vapor phase lubricants...|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction was measured {{as a function of}} temperature on a pin-on-disk tribometer. Pins and disks of 440 C and 52100 steels were lubricated with <b>tricresylphosphate</b> (TCP), 3. 45 percent TCP in squalene, and pure squalene. The M- 50 pins and disks were lubricated with 3. 45 percent TCP in squalene and pure squalene. Experiments were conducted under limited lubrication conditions in dry (100 ppm H 2 O) air and dry (pp H 2 O) nitrogen at 50 rpm (equivalent to a sliding velocity of 13 cm sec) and a constant load of 9. 8 N (1 kg). Characteristic temperatures T sub r were identified for TCP on 52100 steel and for squalene on M- 50 and 52100 steels, where the friction decreased because of a chemical reaction between the lubricant and the metal surface. The behavior of squalene obscured the influence of 3. 45 percent TCP solute on the friction of the system. Wear volume measurements demonstrated that wear was lowest at temperatures just above T sub r. Comparing the behavior of TCP on M- 50, 440 C, and 52100 steels revealed that the TCP either reacted to give T sub r behavior or produced initial failure in the temperature range 223 + or - 5 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{is demonstrated}} {{of a new}} approach to the vapor phase lubrication of ceramics using organophosphorus compounds. The surface of SiC is shown to be unreactive for the decomposition of trimethylphosphite, (CH 3 O) 3 P, a simple model for organophosphorus vapor phase lubricants such as <b>tricresylphosphate.</b> In order to activate the surface of SiC it has been exposed to Fe(CO) 5 at a temperature of 600 K. Chemical vapor deposition serves as a means of depositing Fe on the SiC surface. The Fe-modified SiC surface is then shown to induce the decomposition of adsorbed (CH 3 O) 3 P. The mechanism of (CH 3 O) 3 P decomposition is similar to that observed on Fe(110) surfaces modified by the presence of oxygen. It is initiated by P–O bond cleavage to produce adsorbed methoxy groups, CH 3 O(ad), which then decompose by β-hydride elimination resulting in H 2, CO, H 2 CO, and CH 3 OH desorption. It is suggested that chemical vapor deposition of metals using high vapor pressure metal-containing compounds such as Fe(CO) 5 can serve as a mechanism for continuous, in situ activation of ceramic surfaces for vapor phase lubrication in high temperature engines.

40|$|Since {{the ban on}} some {{brominated}} {{flame retardants}} (BFRs), phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs), which were responsible for 20 % of the flame retardant (FR) consumption in 2006 in Europe, are often proposed as alternatives for BFRs. PFRs can be divided in three main groups, inorganic, organic and halogen containing PFRs. Most of the PFRs have a mechanism of action in the solid phase of burning materials (char formation), but some may also be active in the gas phase. Some PFRs are reactive FRs, which means they are chemically bound to a polymer, whereas others are additive and mixed into the polymer.
