5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Burton Abbott was {{executed}} {{as the governor}} of California, Goodwin J. Knight, was on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> stay the execution. Since {{the restoration of the}} death penalty in the United States in 1976, eleven executions by gas chamber have been conducted. By the 1980s, reports of suffering during gas chamber executions had led to controversy over the use of this method.|$|E

For example, after the PDPs victory over the PNP in the 2000 general elections, Eleuterio spent three days off the air, while convalescing from an extreme case of diarrhea, induced by his ingestion of whiskey. Calls to the Quiñones household were answered by Elpidio, who would try to have his father reach <b>the</b> <b>telephone,</b> <b>to</b> no avail.|$|E

He collapsed and died of heart failure two weeks afterwards, on the morning of 19 April 1992, aged 75. Two hours before he died, he was speaking on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> his TV producer about new ideas for his next show.|$|E
25|$|After Cowherd's {{death in}} 1881 which {{resulted}} in the closure of his Brantford factory, a mechanical production department was created within the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and production of Canadian telephones and telephone equipment was transferred to Montreal in 1882, due to restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the United States. In addition to phones, four years later, the department started manufacturing its first switchboard, a 50 line Standard Magneto Switchboard. The small manufacturing department expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> 50 employees in 1888. By 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees, and a new factory was under construction.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at James' office 20 minutes early, he apologised to the {{receptionist}} {{and said he}} was happy to wait until the appointed time. The receptionist nevertheless phoned James, who promptly came out of his office, welcomed Epstein and quickly got down to business. Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme. The two then shook hands on a deal that would make them, and the Beatles, extremely wealthy.|$|E

25|$|Wilson (diary 6, 9 November) met Bonar Law {{and told}} him that he did not agree that the {{percentage}} of defections in the officer corps would be as high as 40%, the figure suggested by the King’s adviser Lord Stamfordham. He passed on his wife Cecil’s advice that the UVF should take the patriotic high ground by pledging to fight for King and Country in the event of war. Cecil, whose family had lost its livelihood in the nineteenth century, may well have felt more strongly about Ireland than Wilson himself. Bonar Law immediately attempted to reach Carson on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> relay this suggestion. Wilson also advised Bonar Law – at this time the government were attempting to offer Counties Londonderry, Antrim, Armagh and Down an opt-out from Home Rule, the plan being that a refusal would make Carson look intransigent – to ensure that negotiations failed in way which made the Irish Nationalists look intransigent.|$|E
25|$|Haig was {{initially}} calm on 21 March, as - {{in the days}} before battlefield radios - GHQ was “an information vacuum” where detailed reports often took over a day to reach him, and spent much of the day entertaining foreign dignitaries including Newton D. Baker, the US War Secretary. Haig did not speak to Gough that day; Gough spoke on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> Davidson in the morning and to Herbert Lawrence in the evening; according to Gough’s later account Lawrence “did not seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation” and downplayed the chances of a renewed German onslaught the next day. GHQ may well still have still expected the main blow to fall on the French in Champagne. By the end of day the Germans had overrun the British Outpost Zone but had not penetrated the Battle Zone, a penetration of less than 3 miles, similar to that of Third Army at Arras on 9 April 1917, and on three-quarters of the 50 mile front attacked the Germans failed to reach their first day objectives. Lacking reserves Gough had to retreat behind the Crozat Canal. According to his diary, Haig appears to have been satisfied with the results of the first day (which was usually the most successful of any offensive), not realising that unlike the Germans in previous offensives he had insufficient reserves and depth of fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry [...] "that nice girl, Debbie" [...] and [...] "give your child a name, not like your poor, half-sister, Joh'Vonnie".

The video starts off showing a view of the city, before Mauboy appears on the balcony of a bedroom singing the first verse. When the first chorus begins, Flo Rida is seen wandering around in a different bedroom. During the second verse, Mauboy then appears inside the bedroom looking at a photo, packing her bags, and singing in front of a mirror. During this time, Rida is also seen standing in front of a mirror in his bedroom. As the video progresses, Mauboy makes her way towards the car, and Rida then raps his verse on <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> her. The video ends showing Mauboy back at the balcony at the bedroom.|$|E

This approach did not work, and he lost yet another political campaign; he would lose again in 1934. Though Brinkley's American radio license had been revoked, XER's signal {{was so strong that}} it could still be heard in Kansas. In 1932, the Mexican government allowed Brinkley to increase his wattage to 150,000 watts. Several months later, Brinkley was allowed to increase to one million watts, [...] "making XER far and away the most powerful radio station on the planet" [...] that, on a clear night, could be heard as far away as Canada. According to accounts of the time, the signal was so strong that it turned on car headlights, made bedsprings hum, and caused broadcasts to bleed into telephone conversations. Local residents didn't even need a radio to hear Brinkley's station; ranchers reported that they received it through their metal fences and in their dental appliances.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as the [...] "inventor" [...] of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter {{was for a long}} time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the United States House of Representatives passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci [...] "in the invention of the telephone" [...] (not [...] "for the invention of the telephone"), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the Canadian parliament countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> Bell.|$|E
2500|$|Bell began {{a series}} of public demonstrations and lectures to {{introduce}} the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public. A short time later, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia brought <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> international attention. Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Later, Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to Sir William Thomson (later, Lord Kelvin), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to Queen Victoria, who had requested a private audience at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. She called the demonstration [...] "most extraordinary". The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.|$|E

Shortly after Raj Patel, {{the author of the}} recent book, [...] "The Value of Nothing" [...] appeared on the show, Creme stated the Messiah had appeared on a popular television program in the United States.
