5|$|A march named Sir Manley Power was the {{official}} quick march {{used by the}} 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot ("the Die Hards"—a nickname earned at the Battle of Albuera); presumably adopting the march sometime after serving in the 2nd Division during the Peninsular war, continuing <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as the Middlesex Regiment formed in 1881, and later {{as part of the}} 4th Battalion (Middlesex) of the Queen's Regiment.|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Euryale sought revenge against Kratos for killing her sister Medusa, but was killed and decapitated; as with Medusa, Kratos took her head <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as a weapon to turn enemies to stone.

40|$|Educational {{institutions}} have been increasingly started <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information technologies (<b>ITs)</b> {{for improving the}} service quality and achieving the effective organizational outputs in a competitive global environment. An individual‟s intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>ITs</b> is a crucial factor in determining {{the success or failure}} of an information technology (IT) system implementation. This study attempts to investigate the factors affecting the intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>ITs</b> from the academicians‟ perspectives in Turkey. This research extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) framework with subjective norm (SN) and facilitating conditions (FC) acting as external variables. The model has been tested using web-based data collected from 510 academicians. The findings demonstrate that this extended TAM can explain 80 % of the variance of intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>ITs.</b> And also, SN and FC are potential variables that may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> extend the TAM for the research on the academicians‟ intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> towards <b>ITs.</b> This study reveals that educational managers can use this research model as a helpful tool in better understanding stakeholders‟ behaviors related to the technology acceptance, and also in the process of IT investment, implementation and renovation...|$|R

5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> after the war as his headquarters.

5|$|In 1881, the {{committee}} from the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Society asked {{to use the}} building when {{it was not in}} use for discharged female convicts from the prison at Carliol Square (1828–1925) to do laundry work and the Society continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for this purpose until the turn of the century. Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built over the front lawn of the Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
5|$|The {{machine was}} {{simultaneously}} presented {{for the first}} time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of £179.95.

5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position.

5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots {{are located in the}} vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass Effect was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
