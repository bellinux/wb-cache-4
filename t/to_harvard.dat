Following Forceythe's death, Augustus resumed his studies, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1869.|$|E
5|$|After {{training}} as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because teaching was a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> {{in his second year}} (1954), becoming a friend of the future Senator Ted Kennedy.|$|E

This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> {{after the}} war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E

In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, {{as well as his}} sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E

In 1864 Gray donated 200,000 plant specimens and 2,200 books <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> with the condition that the herbarium and garden be built. This effectively created the botany department at Harvard, and the Gray Herbarium was named after him. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1872 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1863–1873. Gray was also a regent at the Smithsonian Institution in 1874–1888 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1873.|$|E

At the center were members of the Bauhaus, a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.|$|E

5|$|On November 23, 1876, {{representatives from}} Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia {{met at the}} Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to {{standardize}} a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States in 1928, Birch went back <b>to</b> <b>Harvard</b> to pursue physics.
