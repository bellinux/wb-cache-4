40|$|Keyword：resin, {{laminated}} composites, temperature, {{tensile strength}} Abstract. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of laminated resin composites reinforced by carbon fiber plain woven fabric at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of laminated resin composites are carried out at room temperature(20 °C) and high temperature(150 °C and 180 °C). The effect rules of different temperature on the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of these composites are discussed. The reasons for the variations of <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of these composites at different temperature are also analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C, the tensile strength of laminated composite decreased by 13. 3 % and 34. 42 % respectively, compared with that at room temperature, which shows that the tensile strength of resin laminated composites is sensitive at high temperature. The reason of the tensile strength of resin laminated composites declined at high temperature is that resin has been damaged and can not transfer tensile load, which makes resin and fiber can not bear the tensile load together at high temperature. The research results will provide a basic reference for the application of plain woven fabric reinforced resin laminated composites at room temperature to 180 °C...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) cable can be {{advantageously}} used {{to overcome}} the problem of corrosion encountered in conventional PS steel strands. Since CFRP cable presents weakness against lateral pressure and stress concentration, {{the application of the}} anchorage system adopted for conventional PS steel strand is likely to fail in providing reliable resistance because of premature failure. Therefore, appropriate anchorage device needs to be developed for the anchoring of CFRP cable. The typical types of anchoring device for CFRP cable are wedge-type, bond-type and grip-type anchorages. Most of anchors are bond-type to measure the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cables. Generally CFRP materials like reinforcements, tendons, and cables have surface treatments to improve bond strength as sand coating, deformed shapes, fabricated covers and so on. In case of CFRP cable without surface treatment, its bond strength is much lower than CFRP cable with surface treatments. Accordingly, bond-type anchor may be long and <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cable may be misestimated. In this study, tests for <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cable without surface treatment have been performed. To improve the bond strength of CFRP cable, the end of the cable was split in order to widen bond area. The test results revealed that widening the end of CFRP improved the anchoring performance up to the ultimate strength of CFRP...|$|E

The two-dimensional detection techniques such as optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the carbides evolution of as-cast, annealed and tempered with RE addition. The results indicated that the carbides in 4 Cr 5 MoSiV 1 steels were modified by adding the suitable amount of RE. The eutectic structure and coarse eutectic carbides were all refining and the morphology of the annealed carbides initiated change from strip shape to ellipsoidal shape compared with the unmodified test steel (0 RE). In addition, the amount of the tempered M 8 C 7 carbides increased initially and then decreased with the alteration of RE addition from 0. 018 to 0. 15 wt %.
