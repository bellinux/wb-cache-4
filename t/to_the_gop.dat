5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{antipathy}} to governmental regulations, {{combined with}} enormous campaign contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> from fossil fuel interests, means that most Republican politicians have strong ideological {{as well as}} material reasons for opposing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to pressure from party activists and voters.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{lines were}} sharply drawn. Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other pietists in the North were tightly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, {{especially}} the Catholics, Episcopalians and German Lutherans, {{looked to the}} Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats more bottom-heavy.|$|E

25|$|Georgia was {{the last}} state to fall, with Sonny Perdue taking the {{governorship}} in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win. In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed {{nearly all of the}} gerrymandering engineered by Tom DeLay that swung the Texas Congressional delegation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> in 2004.

40|$|Abstract—MPEG {{digital video}} is {{becoming}} ubiquitous for video storage and communications. It is often desirable to per-form various video cassette recording (VCR) {{functions such as}} backward playback in MPEG videos. However, the predictive processing techniques employed in MPEG severely complicate the backward-play operation. A straightforward implementa-tion of backward playback is to transmit and decode <b>the</b> whole group-of-picture (<b>GOP),</b> store all <b>the</b> decoded frames in the decoder buffer, and play the decoded frames in reverse order. This approach requires a significant buffer in the decoder, which depends on <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size, <b>to</b> store <b>the</b> decoded frames. This approach could not be possible in a severely constrained memory requirement. Another alternative is <b>to</b> decode <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current frame <b>to</b> be displayed, {{and then go back}} <b>to</b> decode <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> again up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next frame <b>to</b> be displayed.

25|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{perception}} that conservatism {{is limited to}} Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 many Southern Democrats were also conservative, especially about social and racial issues. Southern Democrats were {{a key part of}} a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote {{with the rest of the}} Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern white conservatives moved from the Democratic Party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina's party loyalties have {{undergone}} {{a series of}} important shifts {{in the last few}} years: While the 2010 midterms saw Tar Heel voters elect a bicameral Republican majority legislature {{for the first time in}} over a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern swing state in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in 1976, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in 1992 and also only narrowly lost the state in 1996. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in heavily populated areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative weekly Human Events said Swindall's {{election}} was [...] "one of the genuine Cinderella stories of 1984" [...] and called Austin [...] "campaign manager par excellence, a former Democratic state legislator whose specialty is wooing conservative Democrats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> fold." [...] On {{the night of}} Swindall's election, he named Austin as his new Chief of Staff in Washington.|$|E
50|$|In {{its early}} years Effingham County was owing to its anti-Civil War German-American {{population}} powerfully Democratic. Until Woodrow Wilson’s harsh policies towards Germany following World War I drove many voters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP’s</b> Warren G. Harding, it had voted an absolute majority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic presidential candidate in every election since <b>the</b> county’s formation.Opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Deal caused a considerable swing away from Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, and combined with local opposition to Roosevelt’s war policies in 1940 to cause FDR <b>to</b> only win <b>the</b> county by forty-seven votes from Wendell Willkie.|$|R
50|$|In {{his second}} term, Christie spent {{all or part}} of 520 days out of the state, much of it related to his {{chairmanship}} of the Republican Governors Association and his failed bid <b>to</b> become <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> nominee in <b>the</b> 2016 presidential election.|$|R

2500|$|From 1860 to 1912, the Republicans took {{advantage}} of the association of the Democrats with [...] "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion". Rum stood for the liquor interests and the tavernkeepers, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> which had a strong dry element. [...] "Romanism" [...] meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in every big city and whom the Republicans denounced for political corruption. [...] "Rebellion" [...] stood for the Democrats of the Confederacy, who tried to break the Union in 1861; and the Democrats in the North, called [...] "Copperheads", who sympathized with them.|$|E
2500|$|Religious {{lines were}} sharply drawn in the North in the Third Party System that lasted from the 1850s to the 1890s.

[...] Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other Protestant pietists in the North were tightly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition. [...] While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.|$|E

50|$|Clinton {{as head of}} DNC {{would presumably}} work to {{nominate}} more right-leaning candidates <b>to</b> fight <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> {{as one of the}} signature parts of Clinton's politics is compromise.

2500|$|Tower {{announced}} {{in the summer of}} 1983 that he would not seek a fifth term. Grover, who had disagreed with Tower on many issues, therefore, entered the Republican primary held in May 1984. [...] He fared poorly in that race. In the first primary, Republicans nominated Congressman Phil Gramm of College Station, another convert <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> Also seeking the 1984 Senate nomination were Robert Mosbacher, Jr., of Houston, son of later U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, and conservative-to-libertarian Congressman Ron Paul of the district southwest of Houston. Gramm in turn defeated the Democratic nominee, then state Senator and later U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett, and went on to serve three terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Bilbray and Busby each {{won their}} party's primary, and {{faced each other}} again in the November general election. Bilbray {{defeated}} Busby {{by a margin of}} 54%–44%. Bilbray ran as an [...] opponent of illegal immigration. With the advantage of incumbency and the Republican edge in registrations in the district, Bilbray was initially a clear favorite to win in November. Both the Cook Political Report and CQPolitics first rated the race as Republican Favored. But Busby gained in October, with a late-October poll by SurveyUSA showed Bilbray ahead by just 3 points, for a number of reasons: the general political climate seen as disadvantageous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> Busby's outraising Bilbray, and Bilbray's low profile campaign. On October 23, CQPolitics changed their rating to Leans Republican.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, South Carolina {{white voters}} elected the state's first Republican {{governor}} since Reconstruction. In 1987 and 1991, the state elected and reelected Governor Carroll Campbell, another Republican. Many politicians switched from the Democratic Party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> including David Beasley, a former Democrat {{who claimed to}} have undergone a spiritual rebirth; he was elected governor as a Republican. In 1996, Beasley surprised citizens by announcing that he could not justify keeping the Confederate flag flying over the capitol. He said that a [...] "spate of racially motivated violence compelled him to reconsider the politics and symbolism of the Confederate flag, and he concluded it should be moved." [...] Traditionalists were further surprised when Bob Jones III, head of Bob Jones University, announced he held the same view.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> size is an {{important}} parameter in the 3 D-DWT computation, when applied to video coding because the average video quality increases as we increase <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>GOP</b> boundary effect. However, the computational load and memory requirements increase. Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size would be equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> total number of video frames. Since this is not possible due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> device memory restrictions, we must select <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size attending <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> video quality and the computational time. As we can see in Figures 4 and 5, the computational time increases as <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size increases. <b>The</b> minimum <b>GOP</b> size in our algorithm is 16 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> four wavelet decomposition levels performed in the 3 D-DWT (24).|$|R
2500|$|On February 20, 1980, he {{switched}} to Republican affiliation {{to run for the}} Third Congressional District seat vacated when David Treen became governor. Treen urged the party to coalesce behind Donelon even though there were other longer-tenured Republicans who were interested in making the race. Donelon attracted three Democratic opponents in the special election. The strongest was state Representative Billy Tauzin, then of Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish, who was the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Also in the race was Democratic state Senator Anthony Guarisco, Jr., of Morgan City in St. Mary Parish, considered a [...] "fiscal conservative" [...] but a [...] "social liberal", who was a strong proponent of the never ratified Equal Rights Amendment. Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Namer, who criticized the other three candidates for excessive campaign spending, ran as a Democrat but later switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, VanderSloot and {{his wife}} gave $50,000 to a {{political}} action committee (Conservative Solutions PAC) funding Florida senator Marco Rubio’s campaign as the Republican Party nominee for the 2016 presidential election. VanderSloot also contributed $2,700, the maximum allowed by law, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> presidential campaign of former technology executive Carly Fiorina. In November 2015, VanderSloot announced that he supported Rubio for president and {{that he planned to}} host fundraisers and bundle contributions on Rubio's behalf. In June 2016, VanderSloot said that he was ready to support Donald Trump as the [...] "best bet" [...] to defeat Hillary Clinton, and in September of that year Donald Trump Jr. made a private visit to VanderSloot at Melaleuca headquarters. Following the presidential election in November 2016, VanderSloot announced on Twitter that Trump was not his first, second, or third choice as a candidate but that it was “time {{for all of us to}} come together and unite behind our new president.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth of}} {{conservatism}} within the Republican Party attracted white conservative Southern Democrats in presidential elections. A few big names switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> including South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1964 and Texas Governor John Connally in 1973. Starting in 1968, in the South the GOP dominated most presidential elections (1976 {{was the lone}} exception), but not until the 1990s did the GOP become dominant {{in state and local}} politics in the region. Through the Southern strategy, Republicans built their strength among Southern Baptists and other religious Fundamentalists, white social conservatives, middle-class suburbs, migrants from the North, and Cubans in Florida. Meanwhile, starting in 1964, African American voters in the South began to show overwhelming support for the Democratic Party at both the presidential and local levels. They elected a number of congressmen and mayors. In 1990 there were still many moderate white Democrats holding office in the South, but when they retired they were typically replaced by much more conservative Republicans or by liberal blacks. In the 21st century, political scientists point to the strong base of social conservatism in the South. The evangelical Protestants, comprising the [...] "Religious Right", have since the 1980s strongly influenced the vote in Republican primaries, for [...] "it is primarily in the South where the evangelical core of the GOP is strongest." ...|$|E
50|$|Fox won {{re-election}} to {{a second}} term in 1959, defeating Republican Alfred Clapp, {{who served in the}} State Senate from 1948 to 1953, when he resigned to become a Superior Court Judge.

50|$|The OTI {{program is}} an initial step {{in support of}} <b>the</b> <b>GOP's</b> renewed efforts <b>to</b> better deliver {{services}} <b>to</b> communities. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA in particular, demonstrating a renewed commitment toward the region by enhancing {{the role of the}} FATA Secretariat (FS) and attracting investment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area through the FATA Development Authority. To begin bringing sustained and coordinated development <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region, the FS has produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP). <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> has pledged $1 billion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.|$|R
50|$|However, {{in spite}} of Eisenhower's {{intensive}} barnstorming in the campaign's waning weeks, the mild post-war recession was probably enough <b>to</b> cause <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>to</b> lose eighteen House seats and two Senate seats, leaving the Democrats in control of both houses, 232 to 203 and 48 to 47, respectively. Until 1994, the Democrats would remain firmly in control of both houses of Congress, {{with the exception of}} 1981-1987, when <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> had held a majority in the Senate.|$|R
