The results show that SMLR could be applied to <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> bioactivity capacity of herbal medicines from their chromatographic fingerprints. <b>The</b> <b>predicting</b> performances of SMLR models for predicting CD 80 from the chromatograms of AR samples are good and acceptable. The predictive models built with SMLR slightly outperform those built by PCR, PLSR, OPLS and EN. <b>The</b> <b>predicting</b> performance of SMLR models come first, followed by PLSR, and then OPLS.
