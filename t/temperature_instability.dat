40|$|The {{shift of}} the {{threshold}} voltage, V-th, of p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors with HfSiON gate stacks, subjected to negative bias temperature stress, is investigated. It is found that Vth shift increases with time, like a power law, with an exponent that decreases {{with the amount of}} Hf in the HfSiON layer. Within the reaction-diffusion model for negative bias <b>temperature</b> <b>instabilities,</b> this finding suggests that the transport of hydrogen species in the gate stack is slower (i. e., more dispersive) in Hf-rich silicate layers. This result is also consistent with the observed increase in activation energy related to the ho ping of the species in the gate stack with the p Hf content, extracted from the temperature acceleration of V-th shifts. It is also found that negative bias <b>temperature</b> <b>instabilities</b> are reduced in layers with Hf content of about 50 at. %. This ''optimum" is tentatively attributed to the interplay between the slower transport of the hydrogen species and the larger density of interface and bulk defects in the gate stack when the Hf content increases.

These long-term drifts degrade SRAM cell stability, margin, and performance, and {{may lead to}} functional failure {{over the life of}} usage. Meanwhile, the contact resistance of CMOS device increases sharply with technology scaling, espe-cially in SRAM cells with minimum size and/or sub-ground rule devices. The contact resistance, together with NBTI/PBTI, cumula-tively worsens the SRAM stability, and leads to severe SRAM per-formance degradation. Furthermore, most state-of-the-art SRAMs are designed with power-gating structures to reduce leakage cur-rents in Standby or Sleep mode. The power switches could suffer NBTI or PBTI degradation and have large contact resistances. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on power-gated SRAM arrays with high-k metal-gate devices and the combined effects with the contact resistance on SRAM cell stability, margin, and performance.

In this paper, we provide comprehensive analyses on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on a two-port 8 T SRAM design, including the stability and Write margin of the cell, Read/Write access paths, and replica timing control circuits. We show, for the first time, that because the Read/Write replica timing control circuits are activated in every Read/Write cycle, they exhibit distinctively different degradation behavior from the normal array access paths, resulting in degradation of timing control and performance.

Our analysis shows that, neglecting any impact of charge trapping on trans-characteristic degradation, the individual BTI ΔVT steps are distributed identically as the RTN ΔVT steps.
