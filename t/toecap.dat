60|$|Clutching the bed-rail, Winifred {{reached up}} and turned the switch of the light hanging above her dressing-table. He {{appeared}} just {{on the rim of}} the light's circumference, emblazoned from the absence of his watch-chain down to boots neat and sooty brown, but--yes!--split at the <b>toecap.</b> His chest and face were shadowy. Surely he was thin--or was it a trick of the light? He advanced, lighted now from toe-cap to the top of his dark head--surely a little grizzled! His complexion had darkened, sallowed; his black moustache had lost boldness, become sardonic; there were lines which she did not know about his face. There was no pin in his tie. His suit--ah!--she knew that--but how unpressed, unglossy! She stared again at the toe-cap of his boot. Something big and relentless had been 'at him,' had turned and twisted, raked and scraped him. And she stayed, not speaking, motionless, staring at that crack across the toe.|$|E

60|$|He {{continued}} scraping {{his feet}} vigorously while {{the three women}} went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape {{on the shoulders of}} his overcoat and like <b>toecaps</b> on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{a pattern}} without the <b>toecap</b> {{was used by}} the Canadian Army and was issued to the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines. As an economy measure the number of hobnails were reduced in April, 1942 to 15 hobnails, later reduced to 13 hobnails in September, 1942.|$|E
5000|$|In one 2014 opinion, lace-ups with brogue {{detailing}} {{are considered}} to be less smart than plain-toed lace-up men's styles: [...] "Simplicity usually defines elegance. The cleanest example of a shoe, and often the most formal - whether an Oxford, Derby or Chelsea boot - means no <b>toecap</b> or brogue detail." ...|$|E
50|$|B. Denton and Son, the {{original}} manufacturer, {{was founded in}} the nineteenth century, but the steel toecaps {{were the result of}} war-work. In World War II many new recruits to the coal industry were suffering foot injuries. George Denton travelled to the US in 1944 to secure the rights to the patented steel <b>toecap</b> from Arthur Williams, a dangerous journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "If need be," [...] my landlady replied complacently, folding her thread-gloved {{hands on}} her lap and contemplating the shiny <b>toecaps</b> of her boots. [...] "She had large hands, my mother; and plenty of temper kept well under control. What's more, if life isn't a continual {{punishment}} for the stoopidities and wickedness of others, not to mention ourselves, then it must be even a darker story than was ever told me." ...|$|R
5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard <b>toecaps,</b> and came high above a player's ankles.|$|R
5000|$|Hobnailed boots (in Scotland [...] "tackety boots") are {{boots with}} hobnails (nails {{inserted}} into the soles of the boots), usually installed in a regular pattern, over the sole. They usually have an iron horseshoe-shaped insert, called a heel iron, to strengthen the heel, and an iron toe-piece. They may also have steel <b>toecaps.</b> The hobnails project below the sole and provide traction on soft or rocky ground and snow, {{but they tend to}} slide on smooth hard surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the days}} of the Old West, American and Canadian lumberjacks have worn buffalo plaid Pendleton jackets, wool tuques, trapper hats, tall {{waterproof}} boots with a reinforced <b>toecap,</b> and chaps as protection from the chainsaw. Olive drab versions of the padded wool jacket were issued to US Army jeep crews during the war, and plaid Pendletons became popular casual wear in America during the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Forensic tests {{confirmed}} that both boys {{had the same}} blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body. Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests. A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched {{the features of the}} upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the <b>toecap</b> of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used [...] "some force" [...] when he kicked Bulger.|$|E
50|$|On the north-west side of {{the street}} is the Tessin Palace, and on the {{opposite}} corner is the Royal Coin Cabinet. On the latter location was until 1903 a restaurant called Skomakare-Källaren, Café & Restaurant ("Shoemaker-Basement") {{known as one of the}} best eating houses in town and decorated with a coffered ceiling, pilasters, tiled stove, and the symbol of the shoemaker's guild, a silver shoe with a jingle on the <b>toecap.</b> The restaurant was preceded by another called Drufvan ("The Grape"), later renamed to Draken ("The Dragon"). The restaurant is today part of the museum of the Royal Coin Cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|Dawes {{presented}} the [...] "Courier" [...] for the 1951 Festival of Britain, which incorporated {{a number of}} hints of the future direction for the company's bikes. Hand-built around a lightweight frame with a long wheelbase (comfortable for long-distance touring), it was equipped with a state-of-the-art ten-gear derailleur system, and was fitted with <b>toecaps</b> and saddlebag. This was followed into production with the more specialist [...] "Windrush", a specific-designed touring bicycle and a direct fore-runner of the later [...] "Galaxy". The company's response to the 1960s passion for small bikes was the step-framed [...] "Kingpin", with a three-speed Sturmey-Archer enclosed hub gearing system. In 1971, Dawes first [...] "Galaxy" [...] model appeared, fitted with wide-ratio gears and Reynolds 531 tubing. The Galaxy became the benchmark in the English touring bicycle market.|$|R
5000|$|Boots {{which are}} {{designed}} for walking through snow, shallow water and mud may be made of a single closely stitched design (using leather, rubber, canvas, or similar material) to prevent the entry of water, snow, mud or dirt through gaps between the laces and tongue found in other types of shoes. Waterproof gumboots are made in different lengths of uppers. In extreme cases, thigh-boots called waders, worn by anglers, extend to the hip. Such boots may also be insulated for warmth. With the exception of gum boots, boots sold in general retail stores may be considered [...] "water resistant," [...] as they are not usually fully waterproof, compared to high-end boots for fishers or hikers. Speciality boots {{have been made to}} protect steelworkers' feet and calves if they get accidentally step in puddles of molten metal, to protect workers from a variety of chemical exposure, to protect workers from construction site hazards and to protect feet from extreme cold (e.g., with insulated or inflatable boots for use in Antarctica). Most work boots are [...] "laceups" [...] made from leather. Formerly they were usually shod with hobnails and heel- and toe-plates, but now can usually be seen with a thick rubber sole, and often with steel <b>toecaps.</b> Boots are normally worn with socks to prevent chafes and blisters, to absorb sweat, to improve the foot's grip inside the boot, or to insulate the foot from the cold. Before socks became widely available, footwraps were worn instead.Specialty boots have been designed for many different types of sports, particularly riding, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, and sporting in wet/damp conditions.|$|R
60|$|Gerty {{was dressed}} simply {{but with the}} instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she {{felt that there was}} just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of {{electric}} blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady's Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent <b>toecaps</b> and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a Friday.|$|R
5000|$|Full brogues (also {{known as}} wingtips) are characterised by a pointed toe cap with {{extensions}} (wings) that run along {{both sides of}} the toe, terminating near the ball of the foot. Viewed from the top, this toe cap style is [...] "W" [...] shaped and looks similar to a bird with extended wings, explaining the style name [...] "wingtips" [...] that is commonly used in the United States. The toe cap of a full brogue is both perforated and serrated along its edges and includes additional decorative perforations {{in the center of the}} toe cap. A shoe with a wingtip-style <b>toecap</b> but no perforations is known as an [...] "austerity brogue", while a plain-toe shoe with wingtip-style perforations is a [...] "blind brogue".|$|E
5000|$|Beech {{is a good}} {{wood for}} machining, but suffers from being heavy and having a short grain. Modern machined-beech soles tend to be thinner with a {{shallower}} cast (the curve to the toe). This {{is not a problem}} for factory work, but is a disadvantage for dancing and hill walking. In the former case there is less spring and in the latter case the wearer tends to cantilever off the tip of the toe which gets worn quickly. Machine soles were generally of flatter profile, possibly so as to get more soles from a balk of timber. [...] "I'd sell my Grandmother for a ha'penny a pair". They were comfortable when standing at machinery all day, indeed the safety <b>toecap</b> made only fits a shallower sole with less [...] "cast".|$|E
5000|$|Trampy - He is a {{worn out}} Irish boot {{that has a}} hole in its <b>toecap</b> {{and he is a}} bit scruffy. He lives next door to Charlie in a house, with a crooked chimney, called 'Tumbledown House', which has not been painted or {{maintained}} in years and the garden is overgrown. He loves to relax and enjoy his natural garden. He is good natured and friendly and likes to keep the peace between the other inhabitants of Shoe Town. He likes to go on walks in the country with Margot and Baby Bootee and tell them stories. Plus he likes his friends from the countryside to come for tea. He has had a soft spot for Margot, ever since he laid eyes on her. It has been speculated that Trampy - being Irish and dishevelled - is actually a gypsy or pikey who has left his travelling roots behind.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally using Indian Water Buffalo Waxed Kip the uppers were {{stretched}} over a solid straight last, using lasting pincers {{and the hot}} Half Round Bottom Glazer to heat and soften the leather, and once cooled and set to shape were transferred and tack lasted onto the soles. In the 20th century sprung lasts became used allowing whatever leather utilised to be tacked directly to the soles The junction is secured with brass or steel clog welt tacks nailed over narrow strip of leather (the welt). Most clogs are finished off with external brass or steel toe tins to protect the toe of the clog when kicking or kneeling. Those on the leather welt strip covering the join of leather and wood are called [...] "inners" [...] and those covering the wooden soles are [...] "outers". Clogs could have either or both. The steel <b>toecap</b> used in safety clogs is generally fitted under the leather and is another item again.|$|E

40|$|The {{supervision}} of engineering {{work on the}} railways has received relatively little examination despite being both safety-critical {{in its own right}} and having wider implications for the successful running of the railways. The present paper is concerned with understanding the factors that make different engineering works perceived as easier or harder to manage. We describe an approach building on notions of ‘span of control’, through which we developed the <b>TOECAP</b> inventory (Team, Organisation, Environment, Communication, Activity and Personal). This tool was validated through both interviews and questionnaires. As well as identifying the physical factors involved, the work also emphasised the importance of collaborative and attitudinal factors. We conclude by discussing limitations of the present work and future directions for development...|$|E
40|$|Medium {{carbon steels}} are mostly used for simple applications; {{nevertheless}} new applications {{have been developed}} for which good sheet formability is required. This class of steels has an inherent low formability. A medium carbon hot rolled SAE 1050 steel has been selected for this study. It has been cold rolled with reductions in the 7 - 80 % range. Samples have been used to assess the cold work hardening curve. For samples with a 50 and 80 % thickness reduction, an annealing heat treatment has been performed to obtain recrystallization. The material has been characterized in the ""as received"", cold rolled and annealed conditions, using several methods: optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (texture), Vickers hardness and tensile testing. The 50 % cold rolled and recrystallized material has been further studied in terms of sheet metal formability and texture evolution during the actual stamping of a steel <b>toecap</b> that has been used to validate the finite element simulations.
