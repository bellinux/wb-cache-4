40|$|A {{range of}} porous solid {{adsorbents}} were synthesised {{and their ability}} to separate and capture carbon dioxide (CO 2) from gas mixtures was examined. CO 2 separation from flue gas – a type of exhaust gas from fossil fuel combustion that consists of CO 2 mixed with mainly nitrogen and biogas (consists of CO 2 mixed with mainly methane) were explicitly considered. The selected adsorbents were chosen partly due to their narrow pore sizes. Narrow pores can differentiate gas molecules of different sizes via a kinetic separation mechanism: a large gas molecule should find it more difficult to enter a narrow pore. CO 2 has the smallest kinetic diameter in zeolites when compared with the other two gases in this study. Narrow pore adsorbents can therefore, show enhanced kinetic selectivity to adsorb CO 2 from a gas mixture. The adsorbents tested in this study included mixed cation zeolite A, zeolite ZK- 4, a range of aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates, as well as two types of <b>titanium</b> <b>silicates</b> (ETS- 4, CTS- 1). These adsorbents were compared with one another from different aspects such as CO 2 capacity, CO 2 selectivity, cyclic performance, working capacity, cost of synthesis, etc. Each of the tested adsorbents has its advantages and disadvantages. Serval phosphates were identified as potentially good CO 2 adsorbents, but the high cost of their synthesis must be addressed in order to develop these adsorbents for applications.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} research accomplishments have been made concerning the synthesis of new solid state materials that have interesting and important structural chemistry and physical properties; namely compounds with mixed TiO 6 octahedra and XO 4 (X = Si and P) tetrahedra: BaTi 2 (P 2 O 7) 2, A ITiP 2 O 7 (A I = Li, K, Cs, Rb), and TiP 3 SiO 11. The LISICON series: Li 1 + xTi 2 (PO 4) 3 (0 <x< 2), and oxo compounds with novel quasi-two-dimensional fused TiO 6 framework: La 4 Ti(Si 2 O 7) 2 (TiO 2) 4 m (m = 1, 2) series have also been prepared and studied. For the first time, LISICON phases provide a series of compounds with pseudo-one-dimensional channel structures for systematic ionic conductivity and structure relationship studies. The oxo compound series possesses a quasi-two-dimensional structural property in that the low-valent conducting TiO 6 octahedral (rutile) framework is sandwiched by insulting oxosilicate slabs. Structurally, the preserved Ti-O-Ti and Ti-Ti linkages in the fused rutile frameworks are deemed important to the mechanistic studies of the transport properties which are induced by conduction electrons. In the exploratory syntheses of the above compounds, a conventional high-temperature solid-state ceramic method, and a molten salt flux crystal growth method have been employed. The structures of these compounds were characterized by both single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. The Weissenberg film technique was employed for the crystallographic studies. Other techniques for the structure/property characterization were also used. It has been demonstrated that the reduced <b>titanium</b> <b>silicates</b> and phosphates are new and fruitful areas of research which provides us with some insight and new direction towards {{the success of the}} synthesis of compounds with low-dimensional structures.

The total contents of sulfate ions depend on the TiO 2 -SiO 2 mole ratio. The shift of the S=O characteristic peak in FT-IR shows that the bond strength of S=O is influenced by the TiO 2 -SiO 2 microstructure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

DMC solutions of soybean oil, utilised as test lipid material, were pyrolysed in the presence of few milligrams of active solids under off-line and on-line (Py-GC-MS) conditions. While the yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) determined by off-line pyrolysis were negligible with undoped MCM- 41, those of Ti-MCM- 41 increased with increasing Ti content from 3. 5 % (at Ti/Si molar ratio 1 / 28) to 17 % at Ti/Si molar ratio 1 / 9 becoming comparable to those of <b>titanium</b> <b>silicate</b> nanopowders (13 %). Titania nanoparticles enriched in rutile or anatase were the most active solids (19 – 26 %), while coarse TiO 2 (NIST) was poorly active (0. 7 %). The best performing Ti-MCM- 41 was more effective than nanopowder <b>titanium</b> <b>silicate</b> for profiling FAMEs by on-line Py-GC-MS, but caused a larger double bond isomerisation of linoleic acid with respect to TiO 2 nanopowders. Although the accuracy of pyrolysis/methylation with DMC and Ti-MCM- 41 was inferior to standard methods, the method is appealing in the field of green analytical chemistry for being essentially a simple one-step procedure utilising small quantity of non-toxic and non-corrosive reagents.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{observations of}} casting <b>titanium</b> in sodium <b>silicate</b> bonded zircon sand mould {{are presented in}} this paper.

It has been further shown that the metal-mould reaction is considerably reduced if moulds were fired at high temperatures (> 1273 K). This ensured elimination of moisture from the mould and also resulted in some beneficial changes in the mould chemistry. The reduction in metal-mould reaction {{is reflected in the}} decrease in oxygen and hydrogen contamination and decrease in hardness.

40|$|The use of zeolites and {{molecular}} sieves as catalysts for important organic reactions is reviewed. One emerging area {{of particular interest}} {{is the use of}} titanium-containing molecular sieves as partial oxidation catalysts and is chosen for further study. In order to elucidate the relationships between the physicochemical properties of titanium-containing molecular sieves and their ability to act as partial oxidation catalysts, titanium-containing pure-silica ZSM- 5 (TS- 1) materials are synthesized using different methods. The activities of the titanium-containing catalysts for the oxidation of alkanes, alkenes, and phenol at temperatures below 100 [degrees]C using aqueous hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 as the oxidant are reported. The relationships between the physicochemical and catalytic properties of these <b>titanium</b> <b>silicates</b> are discussed. The effects of added aluminum and sodium on the catalytic activity of TS- 1 are described. The addition of sodium during the synthesis of TS- 1 is detrimental to the catalytic activity while sodium incorporation into pre-formed TS- 1 is not. The framework substitution of aluminum for silicon appears to decrease the amount of framework titanium. The relationships between catalytic performance and physicochemical properties that are controlled through synthetic methods are further investigated using a series of titanium-containing molecular sieves. Titanium-containing pure-silica ZSM- 5 (TS- 1), pure-silica ZSM- 48 (Ti-ZSM- 48) and zeolite beta (Ti-Al-beta) are synthesized and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis, physical adsorption of N 2, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), FT-Raman, and diffuse reflectance ultraviolet (DR-UV) spectroscopies. TS- 1 is synthesized by five different methods. All materials are evaluated for their ability to oxidize 1 -hexene and n-octane using aqueous H 2 O 2 as the oxidant. The relationships between the physicochemical and catalytic properties of these titanium-containing zeolites are discussed. TS- 1 samples synthesized at high pH are catalytically active and framework titanium is shown to be necessary for olefin epoxidation and alkane hydroxylation to occur. The existence of anatase in active TS- 1 samples results in decreased hydrogen peroxide efficiencies in the epoxidation reaction. TS- 1 produced at pH= 7. 4 and Ti-ZSM- 48 each contain anatase and are not active. Ti-beta is found to contain framework titanium and be free of anatase. However, at the conditions used in this study these samples are not able to activate 1 -hexene or n-octane. In attempts to prepare large pore titanium-containing molecular sieves, postsynthetic incorporation of titanium in the borosilicate SSZ- 33 and the direct synthesis of an aluminum-free titanium-containing zeolite Beta (Ti-Beta) are reported. These materials are characterized by XRD, FT-IR, FT-Raman, and DR-UV spectroscopies. The molecular sieves are shown to catalyze the epoxidation of various olefins using aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. The physicochemical properties as found by the characterization methods are correlated to the catalytic data and the results compared to a high quality sample of TS- 1. The modified SSZ- 33 samples contain titanium primarily in the form of isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atoms, although some extra-framework Ti is observed by Raman and DR-UV spectroscopies. Ti-Beta samples show no evidence of extra-framework titanium. For the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene, the Ti-Beta catalysts give quantitative conversion to epoxide, and both the Ti-Beta and Ti-SSZ- 33 catalysts are able to epoxidize substrates too large to be oxidized by TS- 1...|$|R

The consolidation of intermediate product {{can lead to}} low heat transfer efficiency and low titanium fractional conversion. Furthermore, frequent cleaning is generally required.

The method, which involves the two-step reaction of low-grade titanium slag with molten NaOH without the introduction of additives, can significantly reduce the extent of caking.

Finally, the mixture was reacted at 550 degrees C for 75 min. The effects of the reaction temperatures. NaOH-to-slag mass ratio and the reaction time on the titanium extraction were investigated.

Approximately 97 % of titanium in the titanium slag could be extracted under the optimal reaction conditions. In addition, the content of TiO 2 obtained in the product reached 99. 3 %.

The {{objective of this}} work is to investigate the reaction mechanism of alkane activation on titanium containing, aluminum-free ZSM- 5 (TS- 1) and to elucidate {{the relationships between the}} physicochemical properties of the catalyst and its reactivity. Samples of TS- 1 have been synthesized using different methods. The activities of these catalysts for the oxidation of alkanes, alkenes and phenol at temperatures below 100 [ [...] . ] using aqueous [ [...] . ] as oxidant are reported and compared to those from other titanium containing materials, e. g., anatase and an amorphous [ [...] . ] coprecipitate. Comparisons between the activities of TS- 1 and [ [...] . ] coprecipitate for alkane oxidation and alkene epoxidation using non-aqueous [ [...] . ] indicate that the absence of water is crucial for the catalytic activity of silica-supported titanium oxide. Due to the hydrophobicity of TS- 1, the concentration of water surrounding the titanium is maintained at low value so that aqueous [ [...] . ] can be used as oxidant on this catalyst. Issues of mechanism of the alkane oxidation on TS- 1 are investigated by analyzing the stereoselectivity pattern of cis- and trans- 1, 3 -dimethylcyclopentane, the "radical clock" rearrangement of ethyl- and isopropylcyclopropane and the effect of oxidants on the catalytic activity of TS- 1. The stereoselective reaction pattern of cis- and trans- 1, 3 -dimethylcyclopentane indicates that radicals are formed during alkane oxyfunctionalization with TS- 1. The presence of stereos crambling without any "radical clock" rearrangement during alkane oxidation on TS- 1 reveals that the radicals formed may have a very short life-time or their movements are restricted such that no rearrangement can occur. A proposal for the mechanism of alkane oxidation on TS- 1 is given and compared to a mechanism suggested for alkene epoxidation on TS- 1 and the [ [...] . ] coprecipitate. Alkyl hydroperoxides are active as oxidants for alkene epoxidation on the [ [...] . ] coprecipitate but not for alkane oxidation reactions on both TS- 1 and the [ [...] . ] coprecipitate. A plausible explanation for the above results is provided. The presence of alkali metal ions in the synthesis mixture of TS- 1 completely eliminates the catalytic activity of this material. However, the catalytic activity can be restored by washing the solid with acid solution prior to catalytic testing. The washing removes [ [...] . ] ions from silanol groups adjacent to the framework titanium active centers. Thus, it is postulated that a silanol group in the neighborhood of the titanium atom is a necessary feature for catalytic activity. The acid treatment may be useful in overcoming the problems of synthesizing TS- 1 from reagents that contain alkali metal ions, e. g., TPAOH solutions. More importantly, this treatment opens the possibility of synthesizing other <b>titanium</b> containing <b>silicate</b> structures that require the presence of alkali metal ions in the synthesis mixture for their formation. ...|$|R
40|$|Orthorhombic, (Bbmm), (Al, Fe, Cr, Ti) (sub 2) TiO 5 -(Mg, Fe) Ti 2 O 5 solid {{solutions}} (pseudobrookites, s. l.) {{are found}} either as an oxidation product of ilmenite and/or spinel or a primary crystallizing phase in igneous and metamorphic rocks on Earth (e. g., basalt flows, crustal and mantle xenoliths, hornfels), and basaltic rocks on the Moon. Moreover, orthorhombic oxides are often {{part of the}} crystalline matrix in glass/ceramics with useful applications, and {{play a major role}} in the industrial production of TiO 2. To fully exploit the potential of these compounds as petrogenetic indicators and/or useful materials we need to quantitatively understand the factors controlling their properties and stability, and thus, to extrapolate beyond the calibrating experiments. For that purpose, we need to combine thermochemistry, phase equilibrium, and in situ P-V-T-cation disorder experimental data that presently either are incomplete or lacking. Perhaps, the most complete data set is that for MgTi 2 O 5 (karrooite) which allows the calibration of models for the Gibbs free energy of the MgTi 2 O 5 as a function of pressure, temperature, and the Mg 2 +-Ti 4 + distribution between the two nonequivalent octahedral sites. Consequently, the effect of cation disorder on MgTi 2 O 5 stability, and the phase relations among MgTi 2 O 5, other <b>titanium</b> oxides, and <b>silicate</b> minerals can be examined. Calculated phase relations in the Mg-Ti-Si-O system and phase equilibrium experiments in Fe-bearing compositions suggest that pseudobrookite-type oxides may be a more common in rocks than previously realized. However, homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria, and crystallization paths likely affect their stability. For example, isobaric increases in temperature favor disordering and thus entropy-stabilization, in contrast, isothermal increases in pressure have the opposite effect. Although, currently, the potential effect of composition to cation disorder cannot be fully explored, it appears that enrichment in trivalent cations probably enhances entropy-stabilization and thus may increase the stability of (Al, Fe, Cr, Ti) -rich pseudobrookites relative to that of (Mg, Fe) -rich ones. In addition, high-temperature, nearly isothermal, decompression paths of olivine+orthopyroxene+oxide assemblages may favor pseudobrookites (s. l.) over rutile and/or ilmenite, in contrast, cooling at low pressures seems to favor ilmenite and/or rutile. In the case of crustal and mantle xenoliths, the presence or absence of orthorhombic oxides is probably controlled by reactions with olivine, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, and rutile. In oceanic mantle xenoliths such reactions may also involve a TiO 2 -enriched but not SiO 2 -enriched melt/fluid, because pseudobrookites (s. l.) would react with the SiO 2 -enriched melt/fluid to form orthopyroxene and rutile. Parenthetically, experiments and model calculations in the Mg-Ti-Si-O system suggest that low degree partial melting of low-TiO 2 bulk compositions may produce Ti-enriched liquids in equilibrium with olivine, orthopyroxen ad=nd MgTi 2 O 5, rutile or ilmenite...|$|R

Volcanic rocks of the Shurab area have basaltic {{composition}} that is associated with salt and marl units. Igneous rocks of the Shurab area have not been comprehensively studied thus far. Clinopyroxene composition of volcanic rocks, and especially the phenocrysts show Magma chemistry and can help to identify magma series (Lebas, 1962; Verhooge, 1962; Kushiro, 1960, Leterrier et al., 1982), tectonic setting (Leterrier et al., 1982; Nisbet and Pearce, 1977) as well as temperature formation and pressure of rock formation. Some geologists have estimated temperature of clinopyroxene formation by clinopyroxene composition (Adams and Bishop, 1986) and clinopyroxene-olivine couple. So, clinopyroxene is used in this study in order to identify magma series, tectonic setting, plus the temperature and pressure of volcanic rocks of the Shurab. Material and method Clinopyroxene analyses were conducted by wavelength-dispersive EPMA (JEOL JXA- 8800 R) at the Cooperative Centre of Kanazawa University (Japan). The analyses were performed under an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 20 nA. The ZAF program was used for data corrections. Natural and synthetic minerals of known composition were used as standards. The Fe 3 + content in minerals was estimated by Droop method (Droop, 1987). Discussion In the Shurab area, the volcanic rocks area with basaltic composition are located 50 km Southeast of Qom. Their age is the early Oligocene and they are associated with the salty marl units of the Lower Red Formation (LRF). The hand specimens of the studied rocks look green. These rocks are intergranular, microlitic, porphyric, vitrophyric and amygdaloidal and they consist of olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase. Accessory minerals contain sphene, apatite and opaque. According to Wo-En-Fs diagram (Morimoto, 1988), clinopyroxenes indicate diopside composition. Clinopyroxenes are representatives of magma composition and they are usually used for identifying magma series. There are several diagrams that are used for this purpose as follows. 1 - Al 2 O 3 – SiO 2 diagram (Lebas, 1962) : According to this diagram, the studied clinopyroxenes were plotted in sub-alkaline field. 2 - Al 2 O 3 – TiO 2 diagram (Lebas, 1962) : In this diagram, the studied clinopyroxenes show to be calcalkaline. Some diagrams that are used for determining tectonic setting according to clinopyroxene composition are as follows: 1 - F 1 – F 2 diagram (Nisbet and Pearce, 1977) : Based on this diagram, the Shurab clinopyroxenes rocks lie between volcanic arc and mid ocean ridge basalt fields. 2 - Al 2 O 3 - SiO 2 diagram (Lebas, 1962) : Using this diagram, the studied clinopyroxenes are located in the sub-alkaline field. Some methods that are used for determining temperature formation and pressure of clinopyroxene are as follows: 1 – Kretz method (Kretz, 1994) : Using this method, temperature formation of clinopyroxene is about 1200 - 1250 oC. 2 – Soesoo method (Soesoo, 1997) : Using this method, pressure formation of clinopyroxene is about 6 - 10 Kb. In Al+ 2 Ti+Cr against Na+Al diagram, Clinopyroxenes are located above the Fe+ 3 = 0 line (Schweitzer et al, 1979). This case and abundant hematite and magnetite in the Shurab area rocks confirm that oxygene fugasity is high. Based on Helz diagram (Helz, 1973), the content of magma water during clinopyroxene formation is about 2 - 5 percent. Results Using various methods, the temperature and pressure of clinopyroxene formation are about 1200 oC and 6 - 10 Kb, respectively. Clinopyroxene composition and the abundant hematite and magnetite in the studied rocks confirm that oxygene fugasity is high. According to Helz diagram, the amount of water is about 2 - 5 percent. Additionally, the parent magma of the studied area rocks is calc alkaline and tectonic setting is subduction-related based on the clinopyroxene composition.
