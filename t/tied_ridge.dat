40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Alduba {{to determine the effects}} of moisture conservation practices, inter and intra row spacing on yield and yield components of pearl millet (Penisetum glaucum L.) under rain fed conditions in 2012 - 2013. The experiment was conducted with two levels of moisture conservation practices (farmers practice and <b>tied</b> <b>ridge),</b> three levels of inter row spacing (40, 60 and 80 cm) and three levels of intra row spacing (15, 25, and 35 cm). The experimental design was split-split plot with three replications where, moisture conservation practice was arranged as main plot factor, inter and intra row spacing were arranged as sub and sub-sub plot factors, respectively. Phenological and growth parameters such as yield and yield components, total biomass and harvest index were studied. The result showed that out of the studied phenological and growth parameters; number of tillers per plant and days to maturity were significantly affected by moisture conservation practices while days to flowering, plant height and panicle length were not significantly affected by moisture conservation practices. The number of days required to reach at mid flowering and maturity were delayed when <b>tied</b> <b>ridge</b> was used. Use of <b>tied</b> <b>ridge</b> increased both plant height and panicle length. Grain yield was significantly affected by moisture conservation practices.

In this study, conventional (NC) and six in-situ water conservation practices were used to cultivate Soybean in 2011 and 2012 in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The conservation practices are: <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> (TR), Soil bund (BD), Mulch (ML), Mulch plus Soil bund (MLBD), <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch (TRML), <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund (TRBD). The practices were arranged in Randomised Complete Block Design with four replicates. Seasonal rainfall was 539 and 761  mm in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Seasonal soil water storage (SWS) ranged from 485  mm for NC to 517  mm for TRML in the two seasons. ML increased the SWS in the upper 30  cm of the soil by 17 % while TR increased the soil water content in the lower 30 – 60  cm by 22 % compared with NC. ML reduced soil temperature in the upper 30  cm between 2. 2 and 2. 9  oC compared with NC, TR and TRML. Seasonal crop evapotranspiration ranged between 432  mm for NC and 481  mm for BD in the seasons. Grain yield increased by 41. 7 % and 44. 3 % for BD and MLBD, respectively compared with NC. Water conservation practices increased water productivity for grain yield by 14. 0 – 41. 8 % compared with NC.

40|$|Summary Human {{population}} is increasing faster {{than ever in}} the history. There is an urgent need to scale up food production {{in order to meet}} up with food demands, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ogun-Osun River Basin, Nigeria, more than 95 % of the crop production is done under rainfed conditions. Fluctuation in rainfall as a result of climate change is a major challenge in the recent times in the basin. Land productivity can be greatly improved by using affordable water conservation practices by peasant farmers who produce crops in the basin. Similarly, water saving measures would have to be adopted by using drip irrigation and application of water at critical stages of growth of crops. Fertility of the soil needs to be maintained by cultivating crops that naturally replenish soil nutrients. Such measures {{will go a long way}} in ensuring sustainable use of land and water in Ogun-Osun River Basin. An indeterminate cultivar of Soybeans TGX 1448 2 E was cultivated at the Teaching and Research Farms of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria during the rainy seasons from May to September, 2011 and June to October, 2012. Similarly, the crop was drip irrigated for two dry seasons from February to May in 2013 and from November, 2013 to February, 2014. The purpose of conducting the experiments in the rainy and dry seasons was to compare the yields and their components and to evaluate the performances of the crop in terms of water use and productivity. The experimental field during the dry season was located at about 1 km from the field used during the rainy season due to the nearness to the source of water. During the experiments in the four seasons, key biometric data of the crop were taken from emergence to physiological maturity. The crop cycle during the rainfed experiment lasted for 117 and 119 days in 2011 and 2012 respectively, while in the dry season it lasted for 112 days in the first season and 105 days in the second season. The lengths of the crop cycles in the four seasons differed a little bit. This is attributed to environmental factors such as weather conditions, nutrient availability in the soil and period of cultivation. During the rainy seasons, six water conservation treatments were used namely <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge,</b> Mulch, Soil bund, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch, Mulch plus Soil bund and Direct sowing without water conservation measure (conventional practice), which was the control treatment. The treatments were placed in a randomised complete block design with four replicates in an area of 31 by 52 m (1, 612 m 2) and standard agronomic measures were taken. Soil water balance approach was used in determining evapotranspiration during the rainfed and irrigation seasons. Seasonal evapotranspiration was partitioned into the productive transpiration from the plants and non-productive evaporation from the soil. Seasonal average canopy extinction coefficients were 0. 46 and 0. 51 respectively in the rainy seasons of 2011 and 2012, while in the dry seasons of 2013 and 2013 / 2014 they were 0. 43 and 0. 49. The plant height ranged from 51. 3 cm for Soil bund to 67. 8 cm for the conventional practice in 2011 while in 2012, it ranged from 60. 3 cm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund to 80. 3 cm for Mulch plus Soil bund. The minimum fraction of Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation was 0. 13 during establishment for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund while the peak fraction was 0. 97 during seed filling for Soil bund during the rainy seasons. Similarly, the minimum and peak leaf area indices were 0. 13 m 2 m- 2 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund during establishment in 2011 and 6. 61 m 2 m- 2 for Soil bund during seed filling in 2012. There were strong and significant correlations between the fraction of Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation and the leaf area indices (LAI) (0. 70 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 99) in 2011 and (0. 93 ≤ r 2 ≥ 0. 99) in 2012 by using an exponential model. Seasonal rainfall in 2011 and 2012 was 539 and 761 mm respectively. Seasonal water storages in the soil in 2011 ranged from 407 mm for the conventional practice to 476 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch, while in 2012 it ranged from 543 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 578 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund. Radiation Use efficiency was determined by plotting dry above ground biomass measured at intervals of seven days against the Daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation from Solar radiation and the Instantaneous Photosynthetically Active Radiation measured near solar noon for all the treatments. For the Photosynthetically Active Radiation obtained from solar radiation, Radiation Use Efficiency of the crop ranged from 1. 18 g MJ- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 1. 98 g MJ- 1 of Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund in 2011, while in 2012 it ranged from 1. 45 g MJ- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 1. 92 g MJ- 1 for Mulch. There was no significant difference in the average seasonal Radiation Use Efficiency in the two seasons. By using instantaneous measurement of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Radiation Use Efficiency ranged from 0. 80 g MJ- 1 of Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 1. 65 g MJ- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund in 2011, while in 2012 it ranged from 0. 94 g MJ- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 1. 24 g MJ- 1 for Soil bund. The two approaches gave relatively similar values of Radiation Use Efficiency. Positive -correlation coefficients (0. 50 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 89) were found among the treatments between the dry above ground biomass simulated by using a light model and those measured in the field in the two seasons. The seasonal crop water use ranged from 311 mm for Mulch plus Soil bund to 406 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund in 2011, while in 2012 it ranged from 533 mm for Mulch plots to 589 mm for Soil bund. Seasonal transpiration ranged from 190 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch to 204 mm for Soil bund in 2011 while in 2012 it ranged from 164 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch to 195 mm for Mulch plot. Seasonal evaporation was higher in 2012 ranging from 338 mm for Mulch plots to 408 mm for Soil bund while in 2011 it ranged from 311 mm for Mulch plus Soil bund to 406 mm for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund. Water storage in the soil and seasonal crop water use are significantly related. Similarly, the seasonal crop water use, Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation and Radiation Use efficiency were highly related for the crop over the two seasons. Marketable seed yield ranged from 1. 68 ± 0. 50 t ha- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 2. 95 ± 0. 30 t ha- 1 for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund in 2011, while in 2012 the yield ranged from 1. 64 ± 0. 50 t ha- 1 for the conventional practice to 3. 25 ± 0. 52 t ha- 1 for Mulch plus Soil bund. In 2011, seed yield for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund was 15. 6, 15. 9, 25. 4, 28. 5, 43. 1 and 47. 1 % higher than seed yield for Mulch plus Soil bund, Soil bund, Mulch, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> and conventional practice respectively. In 2012, seed yield for Mulch plus Soil bund was 7. 4, 21. 8, 32. 0, 32. 3, 43. 7 and 49. 5 % higher than the seed yields for Soil bund, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge,</b> Mulch, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Mulch, <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bunds and Direct sowing respectively. Average seasonal seed yield of the crop was significantly related to the Total Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation but not to the Radiation Use Efficiency. Harvest indices ranged from 47. 4 ± 4. 5 % for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> to 57. 6 ± 1. 1 % for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund in 2011 and 53. 1 ± 3. 0 % for Soil bund to 58. 1 ± 2. 3 % for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> 2012. The highest harvest indices were obtained in <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund and <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Harvest index was not significantly related to both Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation and Radiation Use Efficiency of the crop. Average seasonal transpiration efficiencies - the ratio of the dry above ground biomass at harvest to the seasonal transpiration - for all the treatments were 7. 0 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 in 2011 and 14. 9 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 in 2012. Transpiration efficiency of the crop was strongly related to Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation but not to Radiation Use Efficiency under field conditions in the rainy seasons. The peak water productivity for seed was 7. 99 kg- 1 ha- 1 mm- 1 in 2011 and 5. 76 kg- 1 ha- 1 mm- 1 for Mulch plus Soil bund in 2012. Water productivity for seed was strongly and significantly related to Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation. However, it was not significantly related to Radiation Use Efficiency. These findings will provide information to the crop yield modellers during the simulation of yields of Soybeans under water conservation practices. The construction of ridges and Soil bund especially for <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge,</b> Mulch plus Soil bund and <b>Tied</b> <b>ridge</b> plus Soil bund increased the average seasonal cost of production by 28. 9 % compared with Mulch and conventional practice and by 10. 1 % compared with Soil bund. In addition, economic water productivity was 3. 90 US$ ha- 1 mm- 1 for Mulch plus Soil bund while for Soil bund and conventional practice, it was 3. 30 and 2. 27 US$ ha- 1 mm- 1 respectively. Due to increase in demand for food, there is the need to produce more crop per drop of water under rainfed conditions and to manage water for agriculture at basin scale. The key priority in the study area was to increase the seed yields, water and economic productivity and the financial benefits at the end of a cropping season. The results show that the use of Mulch plus Soil bund had the average maximum transpiration efficiency, seed yield, water and economic productivity, and revenue of 1, 630 US$ per ha. By comparing the average seasonal transpiration efficiency, crop water use, yield, water productivity and costs of production for the six conservation practices with those of the conventional practice in the two rainy seasons, Mulch plus Soil bund had the maximum average seed yield, water and economic productivity. Mulch plus Soil bund is hereby recommended for the cultivation of the crop in the study area. Other conservation practices, such as Soil bund, also performed satisfactorily in terms of seed yield and water productivity, although with a slight reduction in revenue. The use of these water conservation practices will not only increase the yields of the crop, but reduce depletion of water in the soil, which could initiate or increase land degradation in the study area to the barest minimum. Hence, sustainability of land and water in Ogun-Osun River Basin can be ensured. These findings demonstrate that land and water productivity of Soybean under rainfed conditions can be significantly improved with water conservation practices under the current fluctuations of rainfall and competition for land resources between agriculture and urban land use in Ogun-Osun River Basin. Field trials were also conducted for two irrigation seasons from February to May, 2013 and November, 2013 to February, 2014. The crop was planted in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates and in-line drip irrigation was applied to supply water to the crops. Five treatments were selected and these are: (i) full irrigation, skipping of irrigation every other week during (ii) flowering; (iii) pod initiation; (iv) seed filling and (v) commencement of maturity. Biometric data, which are number of leaves, plant height, leaf area indices and dry above ground biomass, were taken and recorded every week from sowing until maturity in the two irrigation seasons. Soil moisture contents were taken at the root zone of the plants prior to irrigation in order to determine the net irrigation water requirements at each stage of growth. Harvest indices were determined for each treatment. Number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and yields under each treatment were determined after physiological maturity in each season. Regression equations were generated for: (i) yield; (ii) number of pods per plant; (iii) number of seeds per pod; (iv) number of leaves; (v) seasonal transpiration and leaf area indices. Similarly, regression equations were generated for: (i) plant heights; (ii) seasonal transpiration; (iii) number of pods per plant; (iv) number of seeds per pod; (v) dry above ground biomass. Linear regressions were also fitted to the yield, dry above ground biomass and seasonal crop water use. The crop response factor was determined. Water productivity and Irrigation water productivity were computed and compared for each treatment. Linear models were fitted to the water productivity, irrigation water productivity and harvest index. Rainfall contribution to the crop water use was 262 and 50 mm for 2013 and 2013 / 2014 irrigation seasons respectively. Maximum Leaf Area Index in the 2013 irrigation season was 7. 10 m 2 m- 2 for full irrigation during seed filling, while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season, it was 3. 44 m 2 m- 2 for full irrigation during flowering. The dry above ground biomass after maturity ranged from 359 g m- 2 where irrigation was skipped every other week at the commencement of maturity to 578 g m- 2 for full irrigation. The seed yields ranged from 1. 81 t ha- 1 when irrigation was skipped every other week during seed filling to 3. 11 t ha- 1 for full irrigation. Average seasonal seed yield for full irrigation was 18. 8, 21. 8, 24. 4 and 47. 9 % higher than yields for treatments where irrigation was skipped every other week during flowering, pod initiation, commencement of maturity and seed filling respectively. Seasonal transpiration ranged from 217 mm when irrigation was skipped every other week during seed filling to 409 mm for full irrigation in the 2013 irrigation season, while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season it ranged from 28 mm for the treatment where irrigation was skipped every other week during seed filling to 223 mm for full irrigation. Seasonal crop water use ranged from 463 mm when irrigation was skipped every other week during flowering to 523 mm for full irrigation in the 2013 irrigation season, while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season it ranged from 364 mm when irrigation was skipped every other week during seed filling to 507 mm for full irrigation. Harvest indices ranged from 56. 0 % when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 65. 9 % when irrigation was skipped during flowering in the 2013 irrigation season, while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season, it ranged from 43. 2 % when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 63. 9 % for full irrigation. Water productivity for seed production ranged from 3. 89 kg ha mm- 1 when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 5. 95 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 for full irrigation in the 2013 irrigation season while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season, it ranged from 1. 93 kg ha mm- 1 when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 3. 00 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 for full irrigation. Irrigation water productivity ranged from 8. 90 kg ha mm- 1 when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 14. 0 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 when irrigation was skipped during flowering in 2013, while in the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season, it ranged from 2. 24 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 when irrigation was skipped during seed filling to 3. 32 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 for full irrigation. Leaf area indices and yield, number of leaves, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and seasonal transpiration were significantly correlated. Similarly, dry above ground biomass and seasonal transpiration, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod were significantly correlated. The crop response factor (Ky), a measure of the relative decrease in seed yield due to relative decrease in evapotranspiration, was 2. 24. It indicates that the deficit irrigation imposed on the crop was high and that relative decrease in yields due to deficit irrigation was higher than relative decrease in evapotranspiration. Results show that skipping of irrigation at any growth stage of the crop led to reduction in the leaf area indices, dry above ground biomass and seasonal crop water use. Deficit irrigation had significant effects on both the dry matter and yields. The effect of deficit irrigation was more pronounced on seed yields than on dry matter. Severity of the effects of deficit irrigation depended on the stage of growth and its duration. Deficit irrigation reduced significantly dry matter at flowering and pod initiation. However, deficit irrigation did not affect the plant height. Number of seeds per plant at flowering and commencement of maturity were reduced significantly by deficit irrigation. The number of seeds per pod was significantly reduced when irrigation was skipped at pod initiation only. Seed yields were significantly reduced when irrigation was skipped during seed filling. In the 2013 irrigation season water productivity when irrigation was skipped during flowering was 2. 3, 16. 1, 23. 5, and 36. 1 % higher than water productivity for full irrigation, when irrigation was skipped during pod initiation, commencement of maturity and seed filling respectively. In the same season, irrigation water productivity when irrigation was skipped during flowering was 15, 20, 29. 3 and 36. 4 % higher than for full irrigation, when irrigation was skipped during pod initiation, commencement of maturity and seed filling respectively. In the 2013 / 2014 irrigation season, however, water productivity for full irrigation was 8. 7, 16. 3, 24. 7 and 35. 7 % higher than when irrigation was skipped during pod initiation, commencement of maturity, flowering and seed filling respectively. Similarly, irrigation water productivity was 7. 2, 15. 4, 24. 1 and 32. 5 % higher than when irrigation was skipped during pod initiation, commencement of maturity, flowering and seed filling respectively. In addition, irrigation water productivity for full irrigation was 24. 1 and 32. 5 % higher than when irrigation was skipped during flowering and seed filling respectively. Stage of growth, its duration, water requirements and seasonal environmental conditions influenced the seasonal water use, water productivity and irrigation water productivity of Soybean. Maximum water productivity and irrigation water productivity were obtained when irrigation was skipped every other week during flowering only in the first season, whereas in the second season full irrigation gave the peak water and irrigation water productivity. This suggests that irrigation water productivity of Soybean can be improved upon by skipping irrigation during flowering and pod initiation. In this study, the costs of production for all the irrigation scenarios were high. This is due to the high cost of water, which constituted between 54 to 59 % of the production cost if water is purchased and cost of drip irrigation equipment, which constituted between 75. 6 to 76. 7 % of the total cost of production if water would be given without financial implication. Under the prevailing price and economic conditions after harvest, the use of in-line drip irrigation does not offer economic benefit to peasant farmers, who are the predominant growers of the crop in the study area. Economic benefit may be achieved after long periods of usage with proper maintenance of the irrigation facilities and elimination of the fixed cost from the total cost of production. The water driven crop model AquaCrop was calibrated and validated to predict canopy cover, dry above ground biomass, seed yield, evapotranspiration, soil moisture content and water productivity of the crop. The simulated and measured data compare adequately except for water productivity that was over predicted in the validation data set. The AquaCrop model predicted canopy cover with error statistics of 0. 93 ≤ E ≤ 0. 98 for both full and deficit irrigation and the degree of agreement d = 0. 99 with 4. 3 ≤ RMSE ≤ 5. 9 (root mean square error) for full irrigation while for deficit irrigation, 0. 96 ≤ d ≤ 0. 99 with 5. 3 ≤ RMSE ≤ 5. 8. Dry above ground biomass was predicted with error statistics of 0. 08 ≤ RMSE ≤ 0. 14 t ha- 1 with 0. 98 ≤ d ≤ 0. 99 for full irrigation, while for deficit irrigation it was 0. 06 ≤ RMSE ≤ 1. 09 t ha- 1 with 0. 85 ≤ d ≤ 0. 99. One in every five predictions of the above ground biomass was outside 20 % deviation from the measured values. The seed yields were predicted with error statistics of RMSE = 0. 10 t ha- 1 and d = 0. 99 and one in five predictions was outside 15 % deviation from the measured data. The prediction error statistics for seasonal crop water use for both full and deficit irrigation treatments was 15. 4 ≤ RMSE ≤ 58. 3 in the two seasons. The AquaCrop model over predicted percolation also in the validation data set. These observations suggest that the percolation components of the model need to be adjusted to ensure better performance. The performance of the AquaCrop model in predicting canopy cover, seed yield and other quantities in this study are commendable and satisfactory. Specific and distinct features, such as the use of canopy cover rather than leaf area index, make the model suitable for developing countries like Nigeria, where researchers may not have access to state-of-the-art equipment for measuring the leaf area index. Similarly, water productivity that is normalized for atmospheric demand and carbon dioxide concentration and its focus on water makes it suitable for diverse locations. Over the years, it has been observed that no model is universal in its ability to take into consideration all differences in cultivar, environment, weather and management conditions. Other cultivars of Soybeans in Nigeria and other agro-climatic environments need to be tested and fine-tuned in the model, in order to ascertain the accuracy of the model. generally, the model predicted the stated parameters with reasonable degree of accuracy and is hereby recommended for use in Ile-Ife and other parts...|$|E

30|$|Several {{recommendations}} {{on the different}} water harvesting technologies have been made from the regions and Zimbabwe can certainly learn from those experiences. For example, in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions of Tanzania, an evaluation of <b>tied</b> <b>ridges,</b> open ridges, potholes (small holes) and flat planting as techniques for water harvesting showed significant maize yield increases under <b>tie</b> <b>ridging</b> as this method retained more moisture than the other methods. The recommendations were that <b>tied</b> <b>ridges</b> were not suitable where the average annual rainfall is more than 800  mm, as they may cause water logging. In areas with sandy soils, <b>tie</b> <b>ridging</b> is not recommended due to high water percolation and water logging respectively, while in drier areas with about 500  mm rainfall, <b>tie</b> <b>ridging</b> is recommended to farmers who {{have easy access to}} capital resources, while potholing is recommended to farmers with scarce resources. Other recommendations included the crest and side seed placement in ridges to eliminate water logging. However, the main problems associated with these water harvesting structures are that they are difficult to construct, have high labour requirements and they do not allow the use of mechanization (Critchley and Siegert 1991). Some of the water harvesting technologies needed to be constructed on an annual basis and this was a reason for poor uptake. From these experiences from the region, it was observed that water harvesting technologies should not be given as a blanket recommendation.|$|R

The <b>tied</b> <b>ridge</b> technique significantly increased cotton yield by 54 % when compared with the conventional open ridge technique. In addition, cowdung amendment produced 42 % more seed cotton than the recommended practice of using mineral fertilizer.

40|$|Rainfall in {{semi-arid}} {{areas is}} generally insufficient to meet crop water requirements, {{and above all}} erratic in distribution. This leads to crop yield fluctuation, which drastically affects food security. Rainwater harvesting technologies have been implemented in these areas in order {{to mitigate the effect}} of perennial droughts. The successful adoption of these technologies can contribute to poverty alleviation, and therefore improve the livelihood of resource-poor subsistence farmers. Field trials for testing different rainwater harvesting scenarios are expensive, time consuming and laborious. As a result, crop models must be used to help study these systems, and thereby make prudent water harvesting design choices for specific situations. For this purpose, a simple, one-dimensional soil water balance model (Soil Water Balance-SWB) was modified by incorporating linear runoff estimation models in order to predict the soil water balance and crop yield under different rainwater harvesting design scenarios and to select the design most likely to succeed in a particular locality. Field data collected during the 2007 / 2008 maize growing season, on sandy clay loam soils, at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, was used to parameterize the different runoff models and to calibrate the SWB crop model. Various rainwater harvesting design scenarios were run for two different semi-arid areas, on different soil types to illustrate the application of the SWB model as a tool to help design the most appropriate rainwater harvesting strategy, taking into account whether arable land is limiting or not limiting for crop production. The SWB model was successfully calibrated. Simulation results reveal that in drier years bigger design ratios (cropping area: runoff area) of the in-field rainwater harvesting technique (IRWH) {{are most likely to be}} successful, while in wetter years smaller design ratios of the IRWH technique or even simpler rainwater harvesting strategies such as the <b>tied</b> <b>ridge</b> and the conventional tillage techniques can harvest sufficient rainfall for maximum crop production.

Its initial aim was to reduce soil erosion through improved farmer husbandry techniques and it evaluated three reduced tillage systems (mulch ripping, clean ripping, and <b>tied</b> <b>ridging)</b> against two traditional systems (conventional tillage and hand hoe) (Marongwe et al. 2012).

Quantitative information on water and sediment fluxes is crucial as a basis for such financial schemes. A pilot design project in the large and strategically important Upper-Tana Basin in Kenya has the objective to develop a methodological framework for this purpose.

In Zimbabwe, 74 % of smallholder farming areas are located in semi-arid areas mostly in areas with soils of low fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant crop in these areas, maize (Zea mays L.), is susceptible to drought. Under smallholder farming in Zimbabwe, conventional tillage entails cutting and turning the soil with a mouldboard plough thereby burying weeds and crop residues. Seed is planted by hand into a furrow made by the plough, ensuring that crops germinate in relatively weed free seedbeds. Inter-row weed control is performed using the plough or ox-drawn cultivators and hand hoes. Conventional tillage has been criticised for failure to alleviate negative effects of long dry spells on crops and to combat soil loss caused by water erosion estimated at 50 to 80 t ha- 1 yr- 1. Therefore, conservation tillage has been explored for improving {{soil and water conservation}} and crop yields. Our objective was to determine the maize yield advantage of the introduced technology (conservation tillage) over conventional tillage (farmers’ practice) based on a review of experiments in semi-arid Zimbabwe. We use a broad definition of conservation tillage instead of the common definition of = 30 % cover after planting. Eight tillage experiments conducted between 1984 and 2008 were evaluated.
