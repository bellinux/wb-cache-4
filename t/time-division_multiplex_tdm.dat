50|$|In telecommunications, {{specifically}} in <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> and time-division multiple access (TDMA) variants, a frame is a cyclically repeated data block {{that consists of}} a fixed number of time slots, one for each logical TDM channel or TDMA transmitter. In this context, a frame is typically an entity at the physical layer. TDM application examples are SONET/SDH and the ISDN circuit switched B-channel, while TDMA examples are the 2G and 3G circuit-switched cellular voice services. The frame is also an entity for time-division duplex, where the mobile terminal may transmit during some timeslots and receive during others.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Scottish Region used {{a system with}} a Class 27 {{locomotive}} {{at each end of}} a rake of coaches that had been retrofitted with the necessary 'Blue Star' multiple working cables to control the remote unit; but some problems of delay in actuation were experienced. They were replaced in 1979 by a system in which a Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO), converted from a Mark 2, could control the Class 47/7 locomotive via computerised <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> signalling through the train lighting circuits. This had the added benefit that intermediate carriages needed no special equipment, and was found more satisfactory. Such trains became widely used on the intensive passenger service between Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street. When the push-pull sets were replaced by multiple units, the DBSOs were transferred to the Liverpool Street to Norwich service, where they were modified to work with Class 86 electric locomotives.|$|E

The MCSPS architecture is based on a multifrequency, time-division-multiple-access (MF-TDMA) uplink and a <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> downlink. There are eight uplink MF-TDMA beams, and eight downlink TDM beams, with eight downlink dwells per beam.

40|$|Two {{efficient}} {{time slot}} assignment algorithms, called the two-phase algorithm for the nonhierarchical and the three-phase algorithm for the hierarchical <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> switching systems, are proposed. The simple idea behind these two algorithms is to schedule the {{traffic on the}} critical lines/trunks of a traffic matrix first. The time complexities of these two algorithms {{are found to be}} O(LN 2) and O(LM 2), where L is the frame length, N is the switch size, and M is the number of input/output users connected to a hierarchical TDM switch. Unlike conventional algorithms, they are fast, iterative and simple for hardware implementation. Since no backtracking is used, pipelined packet transmission and packet scheduling can be performed for reducing the scheduling complexity of a transmission matrix to O(N 2) and O(M 2), respectively. Extensive simulations reveal that the two proposed algorithms give close-to-optimal performance under various traffic conditions. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Communications {{traffic in}} the world’s fiber-optic {{backbone}} network is growing more than 10 % per year and the growth rate is accelerating. The ever-increasing bandwidth demands are being met by an array of technological innovations including higher <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> transmission rates combined with wavelength-division multiplex (WDM) overlays. We {{are living in a}} revolutionary age. Communications traffic is growing explosively. In this article we attempt to characterize and quantify this growth, and then comment on technologies to upgrade the usable bandwidth of the fiber-optic backbones of the world’s communication networks. Voice, data, fax, video—these are the forms of electronic communication that are growing at unprecedented rates. A large and increasing proportion of the messages are digital. This is because digital signals can be made practically error-free, and the computers that process them are cheap and getting cheaper and more powerful. How can we quantify all this? Since all these signals are digital, the universal measure is the bit rate: how many bits per second leave the signal source. The aggregate bit rate of all the sources is the total communications traffic...|$|E
40|$|After that, the {{cooperative}} transmission scheme is extended for the scenario {{of more than}} two source-destination pairs. One objective is to investigate the relationship between the diversity order and the number of source-destination pairs. This is done by considering the sum power minimization problem. A pricing game is derived to provide a distributed implementation. At Nash Equilibrium of the game, the total transmission power is minimized. Simulation results show the rapid convergence of the game and its adaptation to channel fluctuations. It also shows that {{the cooperative}} transmission scheme achieves full diversity order. Apart from replacing a superposition code based cooperative transmission scheme by a TDM based scheme, the implementation can be simplified by introducing a partner selection scheme to the nodes. In that network, the cooperative transmission code still uses superposition code as the building block. Instead of relaying the messages from all other nodes, in this new scheme, the source nodes only relay the messages for their assigned partners. A natural question is: How can we assign the partners to the source nodes such that the total transmission power is minimized. The problem is solved in two phases. Firstly, we solve the sum power minimization problem for each pair of nodes. In some cases, this problem has closed-form solutions while for the other cases, a simple iterative algorithm can solve this problem. Firstly, cooperative orthogonal-division channel is defined and two cooperative transmission schemes based on dirty-paper coding and superposition code are proposed and compared through simulations. Simulation Results show the significant improvement over the pure direct transmission schemes. Although one cooperative transmission scheme achieves a slightly larger rate region, the other scheme has a much simpler implementation so the remaining parts of the thesis focus on this scheme. The outage performance of this scheme is also compared with a simplified Han-Kobayashi scheme through simulations. Simulation results illustrate the significant improvement in the diversity gain of this scheme over the Han-Kobayashi scheme. However, it is noted that the complexity of implementing superposition code, which is a building block of the cooperative transmission code, is very high when there are many users in the network. Hence, another <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (<b>TDM)</b> based cooperative transmission scheme is proposed. Similar to the superposition code based scheme, there is a pricing game which can provide a distributed sum power minimization. Simulation results also show that the game has high convergence rate and it can adapt to changes of channel conditions efficiently. In addition, this cooperative transmission scheme also achieves full diversity order. In this thesis, different codes and resource allocation algorithms for cooperative transmissions are proposed. Briefly speaking, in cooperative transmission, a number of wireless nodes form a coalition in which they exchange and cooperatively transmit messages. As a result, the order of diversity can be increased without installing additional antennas. Next, a weighted sum rate maximization algorithm is proposed. There are two purposes of this algorithm. Firstly, this algorithm is adopted to find the Pareto-optimal points of the boundary of the achievable rate region through simulations. Secondly, this algorithm can be extended to solve the max-min fairness problem and the joint utility maximization algorithm by the proposed framework. This thesis is ended with some future research directions. With this information, we can assign the partners by Gabow's algorithm, which solves the maximum weighted matching problem that is mapped from the original partner selection problem. Nonetheless, it is noted that when the number of users is very large, it involves a large amount of the communication and computational cost to solve the sum power minimization problem for each pair of nodes as well as the partner selection problem. Therefore, the Grouping Algorithm is proposed to reduce the aforementioned implementation cost. Simulation results show that the optimal algorithm and the Grouping Algorithm can achieve full diversity order. Moreover, although the Grouping Algorithm is sub-optimal in general, it costs only 1 dB of the sum power more than the optimal algorithm. Ng, Cho Yiu. Adviser: Tal M. Lok.

The impact of delaying the deployments or adopt-ing different rollout strategies is also investigated and presented. The SoS emergent behavior is further revealed using exploratory modeling.
