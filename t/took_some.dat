5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, <b>took</b> <b>some</b> amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.|$|E

5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also <b>took</b> <b>some</b> artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919.|$|E

After the battle, the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units, escorting troop convoys to northern Korea and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid-1905.|$|E

5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it <b>took</b> <b>some</b> drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
