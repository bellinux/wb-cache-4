5|$|M-212 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Second Street and the Tromble Trail {{north of the}} entrance to Aloha State Park {{in the community of}} Aloha. The community was originally a stop on the Detroit and Mackinac Railway that was named after a trip to Hawaii by the local sawmill owner. Progressing eastward, M-212 intersects with Third Street and Fourth Street, both of which are just separated by woodlands and residences. To the north of the highway, there is all woodlands and residences. To the south, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few residences. After a while, there is a large clearing, which gives way to a farm to the north and more residences to the south. After the farm there is a large field and M-212 terminates at an intersection with M-33 in Aloha Township.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Women's Wear Daily in December 2009, Stephen Mormoris announced that Beyoncé planned to release several other fragrances after Heat meant to explore the different sides of her personality. However, he added that Heat {{was meant to be}} [...] "the enduring classic... this scent will re-energize the celebrity category". Consequently, five additional fragrances were released from the Heat line: Heat Ultimate Elixir, Heat Rush, Midnight Heat, Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Heat Wild Orchid. In 2013, it was revealed that with $400 million earned at retail globally, the line of perfumes was placed at number three on the list of best-selling fragrances. The Heat releases further became the best-selling line of celebrity endorsed fragrances. Mormois discussed his collaboration with Beyoncé on the Heat line, saying: [...] "Beyoncé has always chosen simple and strong concepts for her fragrances. She's very collaborative in that she know what she wants and she has a very clear view of her fan base. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few of that qualities that make her an excellent partner. She is excellent at making decisions and making them happen." [...] In September 2011, Beyoncé followed Heat with a new line of fragrances titled Beyoncé Pulse.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes when a game {{nears the}} end, it will {{decompose}} into several smaller games {{that do not}} interact, except in that each player's turn allows moving in only one of them. [...] For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few small islands of empty space where a player can move. [...] Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board. [...] It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give {{an analysis of the}} entire game. [...] This doesn't appear to be easy to do. [...] For example, you might have two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it's no longer the first player who wins. [...] Fortunately, {{there is a way to}} do this analysis. [...] Just use the following remarkable theorem: ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{is it not}} {{a direct}} {{survival}} from this primitive state of mind that entails upon us all the desire to find a scapegoat? Our ancestors really believed there was always somebody to blame--man, witch, or spirit--if only you could find him; and though we ourselves have mostly got beyond that stage, yet the habit it engendered in our race remains ingrained in the nervous system, so that none {{but a few of the}} naturally highest and most civilised dispositions have really outgrown it. Most people still think there is somebody to blame for every human misfortune. [...] "Who fills the butcher's shops with large blue flies?" [...] asked the poet of the Regency. He set it down to [...] "the Corsican ogre." [...] For the Tory Englishmen of the present day it is Mr. Gladstone who is most often and most popularly envisaged as the author of all evil. For the Pope, it is the Freemasons. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few men here and there in the world who can see that when misfortunes come, circumstances, or nature, or (hardest of all) we ourselves have brought them. The common human instinct is still to get into a rage, and look round to discover whether there's any other fellow standing about unobserved, whose head we can safely undertake to punch for it.|$|E

Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying {{to be as much}} like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else.
