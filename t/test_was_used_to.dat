25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis {{can only be}} made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of {{the risks associated with}} brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) studies. If the {{diagnosis of}} sarcoidosis is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make sarcoidosis more likely. In the past, the Kveim <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> diagnose sarcoidosis. This now obsolete test had a high (85%) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known sarcoidosis patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case.|$|E
500|$|David Wechsler, {{developer}} of the Wechsler–Bellevue Scale of 1939 (which was later developed into the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) popularized {{the use of}} [...] "deviation IQs" [...] as standard scores of IQ tests rather than the [...] "quotient IQs" [...] ("mental age" [...] divided by [...] "chronological age") then used for the Stanford–Binet test. He devoted a whole chapter in his book The Measurement of Adult Intelligence {{to the topic of}} IQ classification and proposed different category names from those used by Lewis Terman.

50|$|On September 26-27, 2006, the IRL IndyCar Series held a {{compatibility}} test on the Daytona International Speedway combined road course. It was {{the first}} time Indy cars had driven at the track since 1959. The <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the track as a possible warm-weather testing venue (and perhaps a future racing venue), and also to test new engines for 2007. The test utilized a 10-turn, 2.73 mi road course layout, which was {{a modified version of the}} motorcycle short course. The series avoided the full 3.56-mile 24 Hours course due to concerns about speeds, and the abrupt transition out of turn two onto the backstretch.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether a patent claim was directed entirely to mathematical principles or algorithms, which are not patentable subject matter. The {{aim of the test}} was to allow claims that do not attempt to monopolize traditionally patent ineligible subject matter, such as mathematics, thinking, and laws of nature. Though primarily concerned with mathematical algorithms the test has some applicability in all subject matter discussions. Its use peaked in 1994 with In re Schrader. Its use then faded, to be replaced by the now also superseded [...] "useful, concrete, and tangible result" [...] test of In re Alappat. The current legal test for patent eligibility is stated in the Supreme Court's decisions in Bilski v. Kappos, Mayo v. Prometheus, and Alice v. CLS Bank.|$|E
50|$|The Tecumseh {{step test}} is a {{modified}} version of the Harvard Step Test developed by Professor Henry J. Montoye. The main differences from the original protocol were the lower step height (8 inches instead of 20), the more moderate stepping rate (24 steps/min instead of 30) and the shorter duration (3 minutes instead of 5 minutes). These alterations made this test easier to perform and suitable for epidemiological studies. In fact, this modified step test was employed in the Tecumseh Community Health Study run between the 1950s and 60s. During this epidemiological study around 5,488 people performed the Tecumseh Step test. The number of heart beats from 30 seconds after the end of the 3-minute step test to 1 minute after the step <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> assess cardiovascular fitness level.|$|E
5000|$|Early in the Second World War, Harrower {{received}} {{a grant from}} the Canadian National Research Council to develop a large-scale Rorschach test. The group <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> screen military recruits based on their responses when shown a standard series of inkblot designs. The subjects were given a list of possible interpretations from which to choose and a high number of [...] "neurotic" [...] choices was seen as necessitating a [...] "psychiatric check-up". This allowed the Rorschach to be given to large groups in as little as 15 minutes, in comparison to the normally administered Rorschach that could take an hour per individual. The Multiple Choice Rorschach attracted a flurry of attention in the few years after. The test was ultimately found to be of little value, though.|$|E

5000|$|Mutagens {{identified}} via Ames test {{are also}} possible carcinogens, and early studies by Ames showed that 90% of known carcinogens may be identified via this test. [...] Later studies however showed identification of 50-70% of known carcinogens. The <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> identify {{a number of}} compounds previously used in commercial products as potential carcinogens. [...] Examples include tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate, which {{was used as a}} flame retardant in plastic and textiles such as children's sleepwear, and furylfuramide which was used as an antibacterial additive in food in Japan in 1960s and 1970s. Furylfuramide in fact had previously passed animal test, but more vigorous tests after its identification in the Ames test showed it to be carcinogenic. [...] Their positive tests resulted in those chemicals being withdrawn from use in consumer products.|$|E
50|$|On July 22, 1843, Sarah Dazley {{was tried}} {{for the murder}} of William Dazley at Bedfordshire Summer Assizes. She was not tried {{for the murder of}} her son Jonah, but the case was kept if the first case against her were to fail. Dazley was found guilty. The chemists she bought arsenic from were able to testify against her, as well as Ann Mead and {{neighbor}} Mrs. Carver. They told what they had seen, including the pill making. William Waldock testified against Sarah about her statement that she would kill any man that hit her, after making claims that William Dazley had hit her. The Marsh <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> detect the arsenic in William Dazley's body and the result was used as forensic evidence against Sarah. It only took 30 minutes for the jury to convict Sarah for the murder of her second husband.|$|E

50|$|The match-to-sample task {{has been}} shown to be an {{effective}} tool to understand the impact of sleep deprivation on short-term memory. One research study compared performance on a traditional sequential test battery with that on a synthetic work task requiring subjects to work concurrently on several tasks, testing subjects every three hours during 64 hrs of sleep deprivation. Similarly, another study used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging of the neural networks underlying the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phase in the task. This <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> discover the reduction in pattern expressions with sleep deprivation for each subject and how it related to the change in performance on the delayed-match-to-sample task. It also expanded the prefrontal areas regarding working memory and revealed substantial individual differences in performance. The test also reproduced findings of other working memory studies which demonstrated interactions between PFC and other parts of the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Usage of the [...] "alpha/beta" [...] test {{terminology}} originated at IBM. As {{long ago}} as the 1950s (and probably earlier), IBM used similar terminology for their hardware development. [...] "A" [...] test was the verification of a new product before public announcement. [...] "B" [...] test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured. [...] "C" [...] test was the final test before general availability of the product. As software became {{a significant part of}} IBM's offerings, the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre-announcement test and beta <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> show product readiness for general availability. Martin Belsky, a manager on some of IBM's earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology. IBM dropped the alpha/beta terminology during the 1960s, but by then it had received fairly wide notice. The usage of [...] "beta test" [...] to refer to testing done by customers was not done in IBM. Rather, IBM used the term [...] "field test".|$|E
50|$|From 1969 to 1973, a {{classification}} system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing {{to determine which}} class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor.|$|E
