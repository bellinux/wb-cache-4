5|$|Females {{can produce}} up to 185,000 eggs, and larvae develop {{offshore}} {{in several stages}} before their final moult to juvenile crabs in the intertidal zone. Young crabs live among seaweeds and seagrasses, such as Posidonia oceanica, until <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females die before <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
50|$|At the Australian Open, Llodra and Zimonjic lost in {{the quarterfinals}} to Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in {{straight}} sets. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the final in Rotterdam, but lost to Jürgen Melzer and Petzschner in a super-tiebreak. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the semifinals in Dubai, but lost to Jérémy Chardy and Feliciano López, again in a super-tiebreak. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the quarterfinals in Miami, again losing to Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes.

The following season <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the second round again, losing 2-0 at Aldershot.|$|R
60|$|Jack had {{now taken}} his place {{ahead of them}} again, and kept there with ease, although, they broke into a canter as soon as <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the level ground. In half an hour <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their camp.|$|R
5|$|Once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> {{adulthood}} most adult cicada species {{live for}} around another {{two to four}} weeks. During this time they feed on flowing sap from tree branches, and mating and egg laying occurs.|$|E
5|$|As <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> a river, Snow {{once again}} tricks Charming and escapes again, {{only to be}} {{captured}} moments later by the Queen's henchmen. Their orders are to cut out Snow's heart {{and bring it to}} the Queen. Charming attacks the henchmen with his sword, killing two. One henchman gets away with Snow, and Charming quickly dispatches him with an arrow. Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees to lead him to the place where she sold the items.|$|E
5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the transmitter, while the woman has visions of past events. When <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the transmitter, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
50|$|East Fife {{finished}} {{fifth in}} the Second Division. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the Quarter-Final of the Challenge Cup, losing 5-0 to Queen of the South. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> {{the first round of}} the League Cup and the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, {{the club}} reached {{the final of}} the CAF Cup, having {{finished}} as the runner-up. In 2001, <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League. In 2004 and 2006, <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the group stage of the CAF Confederation cup.|$|R
60|$|Late {{that evening}} <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Riss River, a small stream {{flowing into the}} mighty Yukon. They passed along the river bank until <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a {{settlement}} known as Boyer's. Here they found Sam and the others of the expedition.|$|R
5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage grading up process to any EU herd book purebred class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book purebred classes as initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins when <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{reproduce}} {{all throughout}} the year, with peak {{seasons in the}} summer months. Males are highly aggressive and exhibit sexual competition over the smaller females. The eggs, which average at 40 per female, are incubated for about 5 days at 22C in the female's brood pouch. Upon hatching, <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity in about 21 to 46 days. Their average lifespan in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
50|$|At {{the senior}} level, {{success has been}} far and few. However, lately {{they seemed to have}} {{announced}} their arrival at the senior events. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the Asian Cup, China 2004 final rounds and did well against Asian champions Japan. Later in 2007 <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Asian Cup once again, but just went to the group stages. In the Gulf Cup, <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the final twice, only to lose to Qatar and later, UAE; before winning it as hosts in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Male {{members of}} the Royal family were {{members of the}} Senate by default and sat {{immediately}} behind the President of the Senate. They began to attend the Senate once <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> twenty-one years of age and were allowed to vote once <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> twenty-five.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the Group I semifinals in 1988.|$|R
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak by the time <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> Washington, {{partly due to the}} city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> {{the limit of}} their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top. They agree they must stop the war but, once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the {{polluted}} air, they argue again in their urgency to get to war.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>reached</b> the Group II semifinals in 1992.|$|R
60|$|In {{due time}} <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the {{settlement}} on the railroad; and, after delivering the remaining bags of ore to the station-agent {{and leaving the}} freighter with his horses, Weston went back along the trail with Devine. Descending the gully in clear daylight, <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Grenfell camp without misadventure.|$|R
25|$|Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, {{who started}} the season with {{different}} partners, František Čermák and Paul Hanley respectively, debuted their partnership at the French Open, where <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the third round (lost to Cuevas/Horna), and found success in Wimbledon, where <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the semifinals (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić), and the US Open, where <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their first Grand Slam final together (lost to Bryan/Bryan). Aside from the majors, Dlouhý and Paes reached three other finals together: in Bangkok (def. Lipsky/Martin), Halle (lost to Youhzny/Zverev), and Tokyo (lost to Youzhny/Zverev).|$|R
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E
5|$|Organizations {{may also}} be {{directed}} specifically at influencing persons at some stage of life. Thus, we have midwives and doctors who are legally obliged to deliver the baby; as the child grows, the school, parents, and mass media come to the fore; as <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> working age, various economic organisations pull for the agent's attention; {{the church and the}} institution of marriage impact the actor in obvious ways; and finally, the State may provide a pension to the elderly (Russell 1938:166–168).|$|E
5|$|SVT begins {{looking for}} songs nine {{months before the}} start of the {{televised}} Melodifestival (within days of the previous year's Eurovision final). The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.|$|E

5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and {{depends on the}} individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by {{three to five years}} of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened by the time <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> Stephens City, {{partly due to the}} city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
50|$|The most {{successful}} {{year in the}} club's history was in 1931-32; <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the FA Cup 1st Round going out to Carlisle United 3-1, <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup before going out to Marine 2-1 and were crowned champions of the Yorkshire Football League Division One.|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} a lane, at least forty feet wide, was {{examined}} thoroughly, and as nothing {{was found by}} the time <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the fence, the line was formed again ten feet further on, the march continuing until <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> a point abreast of the one they had started from.|$|R
