25|$|The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, {{marked the}} first summer Olympics {{featuring}} the independent Croatia, and Petrović {{was the leader of}} the Croatian national basketball team at the Olympic basketball tournament. Losing only to the American Dream Team in group stage, a strong and inspired Croatian team emerged victorious from the Semifinals against the revamped Soviet team, thanks <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> free throws executed by Petrović, and faced off against the Americans for the gold. Urged on by Petrović's competitiveness and confidence, the Croatians fared well in the first ten minutes of the game, taking a 25–23 lead on a Franjo Arapović dunk and the subsequent free throw. As the game progressed, however, the now-legendary team composed of NBA stars proved too tough for Croatia: the Americans won 117–85, sending Petrović, the game's leading scorer with 24 points, and his teammates, home with silver medals.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{tied the}} appearance of the obverse to neoclassicism, noting the resemblance of Gobrecht's Liberty to the marble statues of ancient Rome. [...] The neoclassical school was popular {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and not only among official artists; Vermeule noted, [...] "it becomes almost painfully evident that similar sources were consulted both by the engravers of United States coins in Philadelphia and by the cutters of tombstones from Maine to Illinois". [...] The reverse retained the shield upon the eagle's breast. [...] Art historian Vermeule described it as [...] "the same old unnatural, unartistic eagle with shield on his stomach, like a baseball umpire's protector... <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> branch and olives in one foot, arrows of war in the other oversized set of claws". [...] According to numismatic historian David Lange, the Reich-Gobrecht reverse design is known among some coin collectors as the [...] "sandwich-board eagle". [...] Breen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, complains of [...] "the 'improvements' inflicted by [...] on a hapless Ms. Liberty. [...] Compared with the original Sully-Gobrecht conception of 1836–39, this is a sorry mess indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Bystanders rushed {{onto the}} track and {{attempted}} to aid Davison and Jones until both {{were taken to the}} nearby Epsom Cottage Hospital. She was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail. She died on 8 June, from a fracture at the base of her skull. Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and Queen Mary were present at the race and made enquiries about the health of both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was [...] "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a [...] "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of the fourth in London, before returning home the following day. He could recall little of the event: [...] "She seemed <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> at my horse, and I felt it strike her." [...] He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later.|$|E

2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|E

2500|$|The head is {{as large}} as an {{ordinary}} flour barrel, and has {{the shape of a}} sea lion head. The neck, if the creature may be said to have a neck, is of the same diameter as the body. The mouth is on the under side of the head and is protected by two tentacle tubes about eight inches in diameter and about 30 feet long. These tubes resemble an elephant's trunk and obviously were used <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> in a sucker like fashion any object within their reach. Another tube or tentacle of the same dimensions stands out {{on the top of the}} head. [...] Two others, one on each side, protrude from beyond the monster's neck, and extend fully 15 feet along the body and beyond the tail. The tail, which is separated and jagged with cutting points for several feet, is flanked with two more tentacles of the same dimensions as the others and 30 feet long. The eyes are under the back of the mouth instead of over it. This specimen is so badly cut up by sharks and sawfish that only the stumps of the tentacles remain, but pieces of them were found strewn for some distance on the beach, showing that the animal had a fierce battle with its foes before it was disabled and beached by the surf.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} the member states, the {{relation}} of EU law and international law is debated, particularly relating to the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations. All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The Treaty on European Union article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the ECHR, but would [...] "not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties". This was thought necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 {{to ensure that the}} EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. However, in Opinion 2/13, after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the Court of Justice (in Luxembourg) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the accession agreement as it stood was incompatible with the treaties. The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the Court of Justice <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> onto its own power, but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new accession agreement. Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the United Nations Charter. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists, linked to Osama Bin Laden. This included a Saudi national, Mr Kadi. Sweden froze his assets pursuant to an EU Regulation, which gave effect to the UN Security Council resolution. In Kadi v Commission, Mr Kadi claimed {{there was no evidence that}} he was connected to terrorism, and he had not had a fair trial: a fundamental human right. The opinion of AG Maduro recalled Aharon Barak, of the Supreme Court of Israel, that it [...] "is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws". The Court of Justice held that even UN member cannot contravene 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order'. In effect the EU has developed a rule that within the boundaries of certain jus cogens principles, other courts may take primacy. The content of those core principles remains open to ongoing judicial dialogue among the senior courts in Europe.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} <b>to</b> a mechanical <b>clutch</b> which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate <b>to</b> a second <b>clutch</b> plate. More specifically, the mechanical clutch includes {{at least one}} stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate <b>to</b> a second <b>clutch</b> plate providing a desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the clutch plates so that the torque <b>to</b> the second <b>clutch</b> plate does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the clutch plates and when the applied torque <b>to</b> the first <b>clutch</b> plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the clutch plates rather than transmit that torque <b>to</b> the second <b>clutch</b> plate...|$|R
