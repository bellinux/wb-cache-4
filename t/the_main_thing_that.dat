25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of}} a big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
50|$|Artistic {{differences}} between Swanö and Axelsson {{were one of}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> pushed <b>the</b> band apart, making Swanö leave after this album (although he did return but by then the band already had split which meant Swanö went by the band name's {{for the release of}} Crimson II).|$|R

2500|$|Doing {{research}} into conspiracy theories {{for his work}} on Brought to Light, Moore came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy, stating that [...] "Yes, there is a conspiracy, indeed there are a great number of conspiracies, all tripping each other up... <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in the conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, {{that it is not the}} Jewish banking conspiracy, or the grey aliens, or the twelve-foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless." ...|$|E

60|$|But, as I have said, {{this was}} not <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> kept me from going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I {{resolved}} at last to go to England with them, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go for England with all my wealth.|$|E
50|$|The game {{featured}} {{a number of}} glitches/bugs upon release. Eventually, patches were released months after the game's release. One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was criticised for {{was the lack of}} a stand-alone dedicated server for the PC version, which the community tried to develop on their own, in hopes that Ubisoft improve on what the community tried to accomplish. However, Ubisoft took the unmodified stand alone dedicated server and included it into a patch.|$|R
5000|$|Overgrazing {{occurs when}} plants {{are exposed to}} {{intensive}} grazing for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods. It {{can be caused by}} either livestock in poorly managed agricultural applications, game reserves, or nature reserves. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of native or non-native wild animals. Cows are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> causes overgrazing and [...] "overgrazing". However, [...] "overgrazing" [...] is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory, while one can observe few [...] "equilibriums" [...] in nature.|$|R
5000|$|Of course, {{it might}} be {{suggested}} that this is precisely not the case, {{that human beings are}} of the second kind, and thus that the justice and benevolence we esteem are artificial and false. Foot would hold that considerations of machismo and lady-likeness are artificial and false; they are matters of [...] "mere convention," [...] which tend to put one off of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>things.</b> <b>That</b> being how it is with justice, was the position of the Platonic [...] "immoralists" [...] Callicles and Thrasymachus, and that being how it is with benevolence, was the view of Nietzsche.|$|R

He paints one of them blue, and then you can't make no mistake. It's just the same with the maps.

6000|$|That, however, is a {{question}} by the way. It is not <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I have to say here. What I have to say here is that in Great Britain--I will not discuss the affairs of any of our Allies--there are groups and classes of people, not numerous, not representative, but placed in high and influential positions and capable of free and public utterance, who are secretly and bitterly hostile to this great War Aim, which inspires all the Allied peoples. These people are permitted to deny--our peculiar censorship does not hamper them--loudly and publicly that we are fighting for democracy and world freedom; [...] "Tosh," [...] they say to our dead in the trenches, [...] "you died for a mistake"; they jeer at this idea of a League of Nations making an end to war, an idea that has inspired countless brave lads to face death and such pains and hardships as outdo even death itself; they perplex and irritate our Allies by propounding schemes for some precious economic league of the British Empire--that is to treat all [...] "foreigners" [...] with a common base selfishness and stupid hatred--and they intrigue with the most reactionary forces in Russia.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{extremely}} probable that this manuscript, of which Arias Perez gives so vague an account from recollection, but which {{he appears to}} think <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> prompted Columbus to his undertaking, was no other than the work of Marco Polo, which, at that time, existed in manuscript {{in most of the}} Italian libraries. Martin Alonzo was evidently acquainted with the work of the Venetian, and it would appear, from various circumstances, that Columbus had a copy of it with him in his voyages, which may have been the manuscript above mentioned. Columbus had long before, however, had a knowledge of the work, if not by actual inspection, at least through his correspondence with Toscanelli in 1474, and had derived from it all the light it was capable of furnishing, before he ever came to Palos. It is questionable, also, whether the visit of Martin Alonzo to Rome, was not after his mind had been heated by conversations with Columbus in the convent of La Rabida. The testimony of Arias Perez is so worded as to leave it in doubt whether the visit was not in the very year prior to the discovery: [...] "fue el dicho su padre á Roma aquel dicho año antes que fuese a descubrir." [...] Arias Perez always mentions the manuscript as having been imparted to Columbus, after he had come to Palos with an intention of proceeding on the discovery.|$|E
60|$|Let us dismiss {{from our}} minds such criticisms of {{parliamentary}} government as are {{bound up with}} the present system of private property, and consider only those which would remain true in a collectivist community. Certain defects seem inherent in the very nature of representative institutions. There is a sense of self-importance, inseparable from success in a contest for popular favor. There is an all-but unavoidable habit of hypocrisy, since experience shows that the democracy does not detect insincerity in an orator, and will, on the other hand, be shocked by things which even the most sincere men may think necessary. Hence arises a tone of cynicism among elected representatives, and a feeling that no man can retain his position in politics without deceit. This is as much the fault of the democracy as of the representatives, but it seems unavoidable so long as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> all bodies of men demand of their champions is flattery. However the blame may be apportioned, the evil must be recognized as one which is bound to occur in the existing forms of democracy. Another evil, which is especially noticeable in large States, is the remoteness of the seat of government from many of the constituencies--a remoteness which is psychological even more than geographical. The legislators live in comfort, protected by thick walls and innumerable policemen from the voice of the mob; as time goes on they remember only dimly the passions and promises of their electoral campaign; they come to feel it an essential part of statesmanship to consider what are called the interests of {{the community as a whole}}, rather than those of some discontented group; but the interests of the community as a whole are sufficiently vague to be easily seen to coincide with self-interest. All these causes lead Parliaments to betray the people, consciously or unconsciously; and it is no wonder if they have produced a certain aloofness from democratic theory in the more vigorous champions of labor.|$|E
60|$|I {{send you}} to-day by book-post, registered, a little volume of tales which I lately put forth--most of which however {{you may have}} seen in magazines. Please accept at any rate the modest offering. Accept, too, my thanks for your sweet and dateless letter which I {{received}} a month ago--the one in which you speak with such charming appreciation and felicity of Paul Bourget. I echo your admiration--I think the Italian book one of the most exquisite things of our time. I am in only very occasional correspondence with him--and have not written since I heard from you; but I shall have an early chance, now probably, to repeat your words to him, and they will touch him in a tender place. He is living much, now, in Italy, and I may go there for May or June--though indeed I fear it is little probable. Colvin tells me of the volume of some of your inédites beauties that is on the point of appearing, and the news is a bright spot in a vulgar world. The vulgarity of literature in these islands at the present time is not to be said, and I shall clutch at you as one turns one's ear to music in the clatter of the market-place. Yet, paradoxical as it may appear, oh Louis, I have still had the refinement not to read the Wrecker in the periodical page. This is an enlightened and judicious heroism, and I do as I would be done by. Trust me, however, to taste you in long draughts as soon as I can hold the book. Then will I write to you again. You tell me nothing of yourself--so I have nothing to take up or take hold of, save indeed the cherished superstition that you enjoy some measure of health and cheer. You are, however, too far away for my imagination, and were it not for dear Colvin's friendly magic, which puts in a pin here and there, I shouldn't be able to catch and arrest at all the opaline iridescence of your legend. Yet even when he speaks of intending wars and the clash of arms, it all passes over me like an old-time song. You see how much I need you close at hand to stand successfully on the tiptoe of emulation. You fatigue, in short, my credulity, though not my affection. We lately clubbed together, all, to despatch to you an eye-witness in the person of the genius or the genus, in himself, Rudyard, for the concussion of whose extraordinary personality with your own we are beginning soon to strain the listening ear. We devoutly hope that this time he will really be washed upon your shore. With him goes a new little wife--whose brother--Wolcott Balestier, lately dead, in much youthful promise and performance (I don't allude, in saying that, especially to the literary part of it,) was a very valued young friend of mine.... <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has lately happened to myself is the death of my dear sister a fortnight ago--after years of suffering, which, however, had not made her any less rare and remarkable a person or diminished the effect of the event (when it should occur) in making an extreme difference in my life. Of my occupation what shall I tell you? I have of late years left London less and less--but I am thinking sooner or later (in a near present) of making a long foreign, though not distant, absence. I am busy with the short--I have forsworn the long. I hammer at the horrid little theatrical problem, with delays and intermissions, but, horrible to relate, no failure of purpose. I shall soon publish another small story-book which I will incontinently send you. I have done many brief fictions within the last year.... The good little Thomas Hardy has scored a great success with Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which is chock-full of faults and falsity and yet has a singular beauty and charm....|$|E
