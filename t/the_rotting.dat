40|$|The {{polarized}} {{processes of}} cell elongation {{play a crucial}} role in morphogenesis of higher plants. We reported previously that <b>the</b> rotundifolia 3 (<b>rot</b> 3) mutant of Arabidopsis has a defect in the polar elongation of leaf cells. In the present study, we isolated two additional alleles with mutations in <b>the</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 gene. <b>The</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 gene was cloned by a T-DNA-tagging method and isolation of the gene was confirmed by a molecular analysis of three rot 3 mutant alleles obtained from different mutagenesis. <b>The</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 gene encodes a cytochrome P- 450 (CYP 90 C 1) with domains homologous to regions of steroid hydroxylases of animals and plants. Expression of <b>the</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 gene was detected in all major plant organs. Especially, higher expression was detected in the tissues that had high activity of cell division. We confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 gene controls polar elongation specifically in leaf cells by an analysis of three rot 3 mutants obtained from different mutagenesis experiments. Our results imply that <b>the</b> <b>ROT</b> 3 protein is a member of a new class of cytochrome P- 450 encoding putative steroid hydroxylases, which is required for the regulated polar elongation of cells in leaves of Arabidopsis...|$|R
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> branches and stumps of deciduous trees.

In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|After {{several days}} of {{trekking}} through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where they save a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team back to their village in gratitude, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of Ya̧nomamö women emerge from the riverbank {{to take him to}} a shrine, where he discovers <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> remains of the filmmakers. Angered, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, during which time he plays a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers's surviving reels of film during a cannibalistic ceremony, in which Monroe must take part.|$|E

5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E

Abigail as the new avatar of <b>the</b> <b>Rot</b> comes to him demanding information about her mother. Arcane revels that when she was a baby she already had power over <b>the</b> <b>Rot</b> and she accidentally killed her by 'filling' her with <b>the</b> <b>Rot.</b> To make him talk Abigail lets him feel rot but she now says he will never escape his Hell and will never touch rot again. Arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him he became stronger than he been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and Alec Holland. As she teleports away Arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal. On earth a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten.

A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis viticola). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.|$|E

25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like <b>the</b> <b>rotting</b> flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, it was {{discovered}} that two Halberstadt residents (aged 24 and 26) had gained entry to the tunnel system through an unsecured opening and made off with numerous banknotes. The two residents were convicted of the crime and sentenced to four months in prison and three years of probation. Furthermore, they had to pay €120 to a non-profit organisation. The appearance among collectors of uncirculated 200 and 500 Mark notes, and of the never-issued military currency, is attributed to this theft. Because of the theft and the slowness of <b>the</b> <b>rotting,</b> the KfW then decided to burn the old currency.
