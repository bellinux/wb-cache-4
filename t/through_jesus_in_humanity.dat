40|$|The {{main task}} of the Church is {{to reach out to}} man with a message of God who saves an {{individual}} <b>through</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Spirit. If preaching the eternal Word – Jesus is the primary obligation of the Church to man and man is able to open himself to it, the question is: how to get this truth through to every man? To find the answer, one should refer to theology, and, above all, widely understood pastoral theology. Time and space and all the sociocultural context is a subject to constant change. It also determines the way of talking of Christ, which varies depending on the quality, depth and scope of these changes. It is particularly important in the era of the new evangelization, when changeability {{has become one of the}} features of the modern world.

The book of Acts documents the apostles of Christ Jesus being empowered and guided by the Holy Spirit to bear witnesses for Him from Jews to Gentiles first in Jerusalem, then in Judea and Samaria, and finally throughout the Roman Empire. It records the establishment and growth of the early church {{and the spread of}} the good news of salvation <b>through</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> spite of strong oppositions. Acts serves as a critical link that connects the gospel of Christ as seen in the four Gospels with its applications as presented in the let-ters of the New Testament, thereby providing a historical framework for the epistles. In this study a se-quence of social networks was constructed from the interactions between the characters including Peter, James, John, Paul, Stephen, Philip, and Barnabas and their locations in Acts. A computational approach was applied to discover the community structures in these networks, which sequentially revealed the roles of chief apostles and their locations in each important period of Acts...|$|R
