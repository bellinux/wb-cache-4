5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood <b>turtle</b> {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood <b>turtle</b> shares with only the bog <b>turtle.</b> It and the bog <b>turtle</b> have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood <b>turtle</b> has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood <b>turtle,</b> including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|The eastern box <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's <b>turtle</b> {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood <b>turtle</b> and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood <b>turtle,</b> both Blanding's <b>turtle</b> and the eastern box <b>turtle</b> have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog <b>turtle</b> and spotted <b>turtle</b> are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood <b>turtle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>turtle</b> {{and painted}} <b>turtle</b> {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog <b>turtle.</b> The bog <b>turtle</b> is distinguishable from any other species of <b>turtle</b> by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted <b>turtle</b> is that the bog <b>turtle</b> has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
50|$|The spotted <b>turtle's</b> range {{overlaps}} that of {{many other}} <b>turtles.</b> It can often {{be found in the}} same wetlands as wood <b>turtles,</b> bog <b>turtles,</b> snapping <b>turtles,</b> painted <b>turtles,</b> Blanding's <b>turtles,</b> eastern box <b>turtles,</b> common musk <b>turtles,</b> and eastern mud <b>turtles.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{were many}} types of snakes and <b>turtles</b> that lived in the area before the office complex was built. Garter snakes, brown snakes, ringneck snakes, water snakes, and milk snakes {{inhabited}} the area. <b>Turtles</b> included snapping <b>turtles,</b> box <b>turtles,</b> wood <b>turtles,</b> spotted <b>turtles,</b> musk and mud <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea <b>turtle,</b> olive ridley sea <b>turtle,</b> and the hawksbill <b>turtle</b> than they are to the flatback <b>turtle</b> and the green <b>turtle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted <b>turtle</b> is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted <b>turtle</b> painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the <b>turtle,</b> {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the <b>turtle</b> in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} <b>turtle</b> {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent <b>turtle</b> hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them <b>turtle</b> meat and fish. Thus, <b>turtle</b> hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, <b>turtle</b> hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in <b>turtle</b> hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E

50|$|The river has a {{surprising}} diversity of <b>turtles,</b> including painted <b>turtles,</b> snapping <b>turtles,</b> Blanding's <b>turtles,</b> musk <b>turtles</b> and map <b>turtles.</b> The last four are considered species at risk, probably because nesting beaches have been degraded by human settlement.|$|R

5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's <b>turtle</b> were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box <b>turtle</b> bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box <b>turtle</b> have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the <b>turtle</b> {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The <b>turtle</b> also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} <b>turtle</b> Emys muhlenbergii. The species was {{subsequently}} renamed to Calemys muhlenbergii by Louis Agassiz in 1857, and to Clemmys muhlenbergii by Henry Watson Fowler in 1906. Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas Say {{on the basis}} of a <b>turtle</b> from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina. Today, there are various names for the bog <b>turtle,</b> including mud <b>turtle,</b> marsh <b>turtle,</b> yellowhead, and snapper.|$|E
50|$|Cryptodira is a {{suborder}} of Testudines {{that includes}} most living tortoises and <b>turtles.</b> Cryptodira differ from Pleurodira (side-neck <b>turtles)</b> {{in that they}} lower their necks and pull the heads straight back into the shells, instead of folding their necks sideways along the body under the shells' margins. They include among their species freshwater <b>turtles,</b> snapping <b>turtles,</b> tortoises, soft-shell <b>turtles,</b> and sea <b>turtles.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the spring, {{when the}} water reaches , the <b>turtle</b> begins {{actively}} foraging. However, if the water temperature exceeds , the <b>turtle</b> will not feed. In fall, the <b>turtle</b> stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's <b>turtle</b> fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill <b>turtle</b> and the leatherback sea <b>turtle,</b> are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted <b>turtle</b> to extend its range further north than any other American <b>turtle.</b> The painted <b>turtle</b> is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E

In the Midwest, <b>turtle</b> racing is popular at summer fairs.|$|E
5|$|The species most {{frequently}} adopted {{as a state}} reptile is the painted <b>turtle,</b> with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont. Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box <b>turtle,</b> Terrapene carolina or common box <b>turtle,</b> has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the Terrapene carolina carolina (eastern box <b>turtle)</b> subspecies, and with Missouri using the Terrapene carolina triungus (three-toed box <b>turtle)</b> subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert tortoise. The loggerhead sea <b>turtle</b> was named by South Carolina as state reptile, while Florida chose it as state saltwater reptile. Florida also named an official tortoise, the gopher tortoise, the same animal as Georgia's state reptile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>turtle</b> starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage.
