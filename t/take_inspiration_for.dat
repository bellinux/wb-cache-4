Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, with her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>for</b> her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E

Second, the [...] "environmental exemplar approach," [...] which looks {{to people who are}} generally considered to be environmentally virtuous as models. And, finally, the [...] "extensionist approach," [...] which takes traditional virtues and extends them to operate in an environmentally meaningful way.

In particular, we could have ironic, verbose, or logic (“Vulcanian”-style) avatars, which communicate, interact and behave as the user perceives that appliance to be: for instance, a user could see his house inhabited by a verbose washing machine, as annoying as some never-stop-talking mother-in-law, and by an English gentleman-style refrigerator, while his best friend’s house could be very different, reflecting his personal view and style.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Scenario-based design {{originates}} {{from the}} human-computer interaction and software engineering disciplines, {{and continues to}} be adapted for product development. Product development differs from software development in the former’s more varied context of use, broader characteristics of users and more tangible solutions. The possible use of scenarios in product design is therefore broader and more challenging. Existing design methods that involve scenarios can be employed in many different stages of the product design process. However, there is no proficient overview that discusses a scenario-based product design process in its full extent. The purposes of creating scenarios and the evolution of scenarios from their original design data are often not obvious, although the results from using scenarios are clearly visible. Therefore, this paper proposes to classify possible scenario uses with their purpose, characteristics and supporting design methods. The classification makes explicit different types of scenarios and their relation to one another. Furthermore, novel scenario uses can be referred or added to the classification to develop it in parallel with the scenario-based design practice. Eventually, a scenario-based product design process could <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>for</b> creating scenarios from the classification because it provides detailed characteristics of the scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Workshop on Reclaiming Beauty   25 May 2011 University of Cambridge Agnes Horvath, James Cuffe (O’Duibh) University College Cork School of Sociology Safari Building,O'Donovan's Road tel. : 00353 21490 3318 Email: james@jamescuffe. com Visit {{the website}} at [URL] {{workshop}} will {{be concerned with}} the contemporary significance and relevance of Beauty. The Renaissance attempted {{to return to the}} ancient concern with beauty, central to classical Greek and Roman culture and philosophy, taking over and imitating its norms in architecture, in philosophy, and the arts; but excessive formal imitation undermines forms and fails to rekindle the spirit. This is why the Renaissance was followed by the Reformation, with its attempt to resuscitate Christian ascetic purity, with similarly problematic results; while its centrality as a historical period for the gestation of the modern world was replaced by the Protestant Ethic and the Enlightenment by sociologists and by political scientists, just as by comparative historians or public philosophers, up to our days. Concerning the first, it is enough to refer to Max Weber’s famous thesis about the Protestant work Ethic and the rise of modern capitalism; while concerning the latter, the central reference point is Habermas’s call for a return to the ‘Enlightenment project’. However, we would argue that, beyond the schismatic religious divisions that marred the early modern period, and beyond the legacies of the Enlightenment we should rather <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>for</b> reclaiming beauty from the Renaissance, if not directly from Antiquity. This is because they came close to identifying Beauty with the social, {{in the sense of the}} eidos, as an absolute, moral and eternal, that exists separately and independently from us, yet within reach. This is what we mean by ‘reclaiming beauty’ – the recognition of the ‘invis¬ible and unchanging beauty which pervades all things’ (in the words of Plotinus, as quoted by Gregory Bateson). Given these aims, the Workshop will have to be interdisciplinary, even pluri-disciplinary. As both Antiquity and the Renaissance are historical periods, the Workshop will rely centrally upon the contribution of comparative historical sociologists and philosophers of history. However, given that it will connect the Classical Greek and Roman period and Italian Renaissance of the 13 th to 16 th centuries to the present, it will also strongly involve social scientists, focusing especially on anthropological perspectives, including both the discipline of social and cultural anthropology, the history and philosophy of science and the broader horizon of classical philosophical anthropology, in particular the work of pre-Socratics and Plato, among contemporary thinkers Gabriel Tarde, Gregory Bateson and Colin Turnbull, and also Bruno Latour, one of the first contemporaries who re-claimed the value of the ‘charming social’. This workshop will be a forum for researchers across disciplines and historical periods, for all those interested in the history of harmonious existence, searching for giving a standard and constitution for being, in taking back the dignity of nature and joy of order.
