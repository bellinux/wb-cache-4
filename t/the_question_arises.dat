As {{in the case of}} the singers, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
25|$|A central {{question}} {{with regard to}} marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> due to a statement of Jesus’ {{that there is no}} marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven as a detailed analysis of what he meant.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to what}} {{motivated}} the socii to rebel after over a century of integration and seeming contentment. Scholars have pointed to a growing desire, in the late 2nd century BC, for full citizenship {{and the right to}} vote {{on the part of the}} socii. But this is difficult to understand in isolation. As explained above, the political power conferred by the vote was mostly illusory and, in any event, the Latin colonists, who also did not have voting rights, did not rebel.|$|E

Evidently {{the lesson of}} the Packard One-Twenty had been weighing on the minds of the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to why}} the 4th-century army needed forts with {{enhanced}} defensive features {{whereas the}} 2nd-century army apparently did not. Luttwak argues that defensible forts were an integral feature of a 4th-century defence-in-depth [...] "grand strategy", while in the 2nd century [...] "preclusive defence" [...] rendered such forts unnecessary [...] But the existence of such a [...] "strategy" [...] is strongly disputed by several scholars, as many elements of the late Roman army's posture were consistent with continued forward defence. An alternative explanation is that preclusive defence was still in effect but was not working as well as previously and barbarian raids were penetrating the empire more frequently.(see Strategy, below) ...|$|E

500|$|Non-reductionist {{philosophers}} hold {{firmly to}} two essential convictions {{with regard to}} mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. Donald Davidson's anomalous monism {{is an attempt to}} formulate such a physicalism. He [...] "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere." ...|$|E

[...] The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend.

2500|$|Consider some {{subtleties}} {{that people}} are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience.

2500|$|The 19 Latin colonies {{founded in}} the period 338–263 outnumbered the Roman ones by four to one. This is because they {{involved}} a mixed Roman/original Latin/Italian allied population, and so could more easily attract the necessary number of settlers. But because of the mix, the settlers did not hold citizenship (the Romans among them lost their full citizenship). Instead, they were granted the iura Latina ("Latin rights") held by original Latins before their incorporation into the citizen body. In essence, these rights were similar to the civitates sine suffragio, except that the Latin colonists were technically not citizens, but peregrini ("foreigners"), although they could recover their citizenship by returning to Roman territory. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to why the}} Latin colonists were not simply accorded citizenship sine suffragio. The answer is probably for reasons of military security. Classified as non-citizens, the Latins served in the allied alae, not the legions. There they could act as loyal [...] "watchdogs" [...] on potentially treacherous Italian socii, while the Romans/original Latins performed the same function in the legions on their sine suffragio colleagues.|$|E
