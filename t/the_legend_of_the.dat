5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and <b>the</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'aul' Kirk stane'. <b>The</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone {{in the direction of}} Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E

5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses <b>the</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but}} to slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed Darwinian evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued {{that there was a}} blueprint for existence and that genetic memory was a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, <b>The</b> <b>Legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to historical sources, Poe {{was influenced by}} other writers. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such as the Court Gazette and the Torch. The ship of corpses recalls <b>the</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flying Dutchman, a ship which is cursed and unable to return home.|$|E
5|$|It {{was partly}} down to <b>the</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witch that {{prompted}} TV's Most Haunted team to visit Wookey Hole Caves and Mill {{to explore the}} location in depth, searching for evidence of paranormal activity. The show, which aired on 10 March 2009, was the last episode transmitted in series 11 of the show's run on the satellite and cable TV channel Living. In 2009 a new actor to play the 'witch' was chosen by Wookey Hole Ltd amid much media interest. Carole Bohanan {{in the role of}} Carla Calamity was selected ahead of over 3,000 other applicants.|$|E
5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, based on <b>the</b> <b>legend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released {{a series of}} films based on Chinese legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories were selected because the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese imports from China, but wanted to see films based on Chinese mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E
