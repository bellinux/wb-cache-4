5|$|Downes {{joined the}} First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 2 October 1914, {{assuming}} {{command of the}} 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance with the rank of lieutenant colonel—making him the youngest officer of that rank in the AIF at the <b>time.</b> <b>Soon</b> after his taking command, the unit was renamed the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance. After training at the Broadmeadows Army Camp near Melbourne, the unit embarked for Egypt on the transport Chilka on 2 February 1915.|$|E
5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity {{is likely}} due to SEGA's desire to maintain Sonic's free and youthful nature, believing that committing to a relationship {{at this point in}} his life would simply be uncharacteristic of him. In addition, given that chasing Sonic and the ensuing antics are fundamental parts of Amy's character, their relation seems unlikely to change any <b>time</b> <b>soon.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still in}} his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any <b>time</b> <b>soon.</b> Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

50|$|Changes in the {{patterns}} of ship operations (smaller crews and faster turn round <b>times)</b> <b>soon</b> prompted At this time rapid changes were occurring in international shipping and these affected {{the operations of the}} Mission. Macquarie Place was sold in 1985 and a property at 320-324 Sussex Street obtained and the new facilities opened in 1993.|$|R
5|$|Downes, in {{his role}} as DGMS, pressed for the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for the care of sick and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. <b>Time</b> <b>soon</b> vindicated his judgement; and today the major military hospitals in the state capital cities, the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} <b>time.</b> <b>Soon</b> after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E
5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would be}} no election any <b>time</b> <b>soon</b> – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E

5000|$|Soon thereafter, however, Hoodoo hired {{two local}} {{attorneys}} {{and was released}} when the attorneys managed {{to prove that the}} officers had no legal authority for holding Brown.

50|$|Like so {{many other}} Catholic painters, he fell on hard <b>times</b> <b>soon</b> after this as the Rampjaar approached. Records show him selling {{possessions}} {{again and again in}} 1670, and the next year he died in The Hague, leaving all of his drawings and engravings to his student Simon du Parcq. Though he had been a highly respected and successful man, his entire estate only brought 1,000 guilders.|$|R
5000|$|Jas Heriot Duke (1939-1992) was a cult {{figure in}} the Australian {{performance}} poetry scene. He worked {{much of his life}} in Melbourne Board of Works and began writing poetry in 1966.

He writes [...] "I started performing poems as a timid person with a stutter but the spirit of the <b>times</b> <b>soon</b> converted me into a bellowing bull." ...|$|R
25|$|The UDP regained {{power in}} the 1993 {{national}} election, and Esquivel became prime minister for a second <b>time.</b> <b>Soon</b> afterwards Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas.|$|E

He left for the Sunday <b>Times</b> <b>soon</b> after an incident in 2002, when the newspaper misrepresented an article he had written about Roy Keane {{in the wake of}} the Saipan saga involving Keane.

25|$|About this <b>time,</b> <b>soon</b> after daybreak, North Korean {{infantry}} {{had closed}} in {{so as to}} virtually surround the artillery, still in the village. The North Korean 13th Regiment of the NK 6th Division now struck furiously from three sides at the 555th and 90th Field Artillery Battalions' positions. The attack came suddenly and with devastating power. Troops in the column spotted two tanks and several self-propelled guns on the dirt trail in the valley north of Pongam-ni, firing into the village and the artillery positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{petrol tank}} filler came adrift {{as they neared}} the Adriatic coast and drenched them both.

Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed <b>time.</b> <b>Soon</b> after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{purchased}} {{land from}} the Tasmanian Government {{in the southern part}} of the airport for future development of operational facilities. This additional area would allow for a short runway for general aviation aircraft, either parallel to the main runway along the southern end of the eastern boundary of the airport, or a cross runway towards the southern end of the main runway. The alternative second runway would provide an opportunity to improve the operational management of the lighter categories of aircraft. However, the second runway is not likely to be developed any <b>time</b> <b>soon,</b> because the existing runway is under-utilised.|$|E
