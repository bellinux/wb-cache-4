5|$|The {{conditions}} {{surrounding the}} emplacement of <b>the</b> <b>sulfur</b> have caused <b>the</b> <b>sulfur</b> to assume various colours, including black, brown-orange, orange, red, yellow, and yellow-orange.

5|$|The R-groups on <b>the</b> <b>sulfur,</b> though {{typically}} methyls, {{have been}} used to synthesize reagents that can perform enantioselective variants of the reaction (See Variations below). The size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in alicyclic substrates.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{molecule}} with inequivalent atoms of the same element is the thiosulfate ion (...) , for which the algebraic sum rule yields the average value +2 for <b>sulfur,</b> where <b>the</b> two ionizing electrons are assigned to <b>the</b> terminal <b>sulfur</b> atom.

40|$|A {{sequential}} extraction {{method has}} been developed for the determination of carbon-bonded <b>sulfur</b> in soils. <b>The</b> soil sample has been sequentially reduced with HI and oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, and finally the residue has been digested {{with a mixture of}} nitric acid and perchloric acid.

Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sulfur</b> cycle, archaea {{that grow}} by {{oxidizing}} sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms.

5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces <b>the</b> <b>sulfur.</b> Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with <b>the</b> <b>sulfur</b> transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters.

5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send <b>the</b> <b>sulfur</b> over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E
