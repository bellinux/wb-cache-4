2500|$|Gould {{pointed out}} that if the genetic {{heritability}} of IQ were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group, it would not explain the causes of IQ differences among the people of a group, or if said IQ differences {{can be attributed to}} the environment. For example, the height of a person is genetically determined, but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors (e.g. the quality of nutrition) and to genetic inheritance. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, a colleague of Gould’s, is a proponent of this argument in relation to IQ tests. An example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not, is the statement: [...] "If all environments were to become equal for everyone, heritability would rise to 100 percent because all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin", which Gould said is misleading, at best, and false, at worst. First, it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man, woman, and child grew up in the same environment, because their spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersion</b> upon the planet Earth makes it impossible. Second, were people to grow up in the same environment, not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development. Therefore, heritability is not a measure of phenotypic (physiognomy and physique) differences among racial and ethnic groups, but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population.|$|E

30|$|Varian (1980) {{was among}} the first to {{distinguish}} between spatial and <b>temporal</b> price <b>dispersion.</b> Spatial price dispersion implies that the firm’s place in the price distribution does not necessarily change over time. In our context, any permanent price differences could be explained by store differentiation as price dispersion should diminish over time if consumers can learn (from experience) that some firms consistently offer lower prices than others. <b>Temporal</b> price <b>dispersion</b> arises when the store’s position in a price-based ranking changes over time.

INTRODUCTION The introduction of {{wireless communication}} receivers with multiple antenna elements makes it possible to perform space-time equalization. Such receivers efficiently combat intersymbol and co-channel interference caused by the spatio-temporal structure of the multipath channels. However, often the spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersions</b> in the channel is restricted to a low-dimensional subspace. We call such a channel a reduced rank channel.

40|$|Perceptual {{decisions}} {{are thought to}} be mediated by a mechanism of sequential sampling and integration of noisy evidence whose temporal weighting profile affects the decision quality. To examine temporal weighting, participants were presented with two brightness-fluctuating disks for 1, 2 or 3 seconds and were requested to choose the overall brighter disk {{at the end of each}} trial. By employing a signal-perturbation method, which deploys across trials a set of systematically controlled <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersions</b> of the same overall signal, we were able to quantify the participants' temporal weighting profile. Results indicate that, for intervals of 1 or 2 sec, participants exhibit a primacy-bias. However, for longer stimuli (3 -sec) the temporal weighting profile is non-monotonic, with concurrent primacy and recency, which is inconsistent with the predictions of previously suggested computational models of perceptual decision-making (drift-diffusion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes). We propose a novel, dynamic variant of the leaky-competing accumulator model as a potential account for this finding, and we discuss potential neural mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|There is the {{technical}} difficultly of achieving a large illumination area without destroying the imaging optics. One {{approach is the}} so-called spatiotemporal focusing in which the pulsed beam is spatially dispersed by a diffraction grating forming a 'rainbow' beam that is subsequently focused by an objective lens. The effect of focusing the 'rainbow' beam while imaging the diffraction grating forces the different wavelengths to overlap at the focal plane of the objective lens. The different wavelengths then only interfere at the overlapping volume, if no further spatial or <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersion</b> is introduced, so that the intense pulsed illumination is retrieved and capable of yielding cross-sectioned images. The axial resolution is typically 2-3 µm even with structured illumination techniques. The spatial dispersion generated by the diffraction grating ensures that the energy in the laser is spread over a wider area in the objective lens, hence reducing the possibility of damaging the lens itself. The main disadvantage of this technique is the further spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersion</b> that can be introduced {{by the presence of}} irregular objects or interfaces, particularly for deep tissue imaging (which {{is one of the main}} advantages of multiphoton microscopy over one-photon fluorescence).|$|E
50|$|Another technique, {{temporal}} imaging using a time lens, {{can also}} be used to slow down (mostly optical) signals in time. The time-lens concept relies on the mathematical equivalence between spatial diffraction and <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> the so-called space-time duality. A lens held at fixed distance from an object produces a magnified visible image. The lens imparts a quadratic phase shift to the spatial frequency components of the optical waves; in conjunction with the free space propagation (object to lens, lens to eye), this generates a magnified image. Owing to the mathematical equivalence between paraxial diffraction and <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> an optical waveform can be temporally imaged by a three-step process of dispersing it in time, subjecting it to a phase shift that is quadratic in time (the time lens itself), and dispersing it again. Theoretically, a focused aberration-free image is obtained under a specific condition when the two dispersive elements and the phase shift satisfy the temporal equivalent of the classic lens equation. Alternatively, the time lens can be used without the second dispersive element to transfer the waveform’s temporal profile to the spectral domain, analogous to the property that an ordinary lens produces the spatial Fourier transform of an object at its focal points.|$|E

30|$|We observe <b>temporal</b> price <b>dispersion</b> {{when the}} {{identity}} of the store offering the lowest (and highest) price varies over time. If stores’ relative positions in the price distribution remain constant, then dispersed prices could simply reflect store heterogeneity.

In this latter case, firms change their prices so that buyers cannot identify the “cheapest” store overall.|$|R
40|$|The chirp-evoked ABR {{has been}} termed a more {{synchronous}} response, {{referring to the}} fact that rising-frequency chirp stimuli theoretically compensate for <b>temporal</b> <b>dispersions</b> down the basilar membrane. This compensation is made possible by delaying the higher frequency content of the stimulus until the lower frequency traveling waves are closer to the cochlea apex. However, it is not yet clear how sensitive this temporal compensation is to variation in the delay interval. This study analyzed chirp- and click-evoked ABRs at low intensity, using a variety of tools in the time, frequency, and phase domains, to measure synchrony in the response. Additionally, this study also examined the relationship between chirp sweep rate and response synchrony by varying the delay between high- and low-frequency portions of chirp stimuli. The results suggest that the chirp- evoked ABRs in this study exhibited more synchrony than the click-evoked ABRs and that slight gender-based differences exist in the synchrony of chirp-evoked ABRs. The study concludes that a tailoring of chirp parameters to gender may be beneficial in pathologies that severely affect neural synchrony, but that such a customization may not be necessary in routine clinical applications...|$|R

Further, we use the Bogoliubov theory of weakly-interacting gases and show that the time-dependent magnetic field power absorption exhibits double resonance structure corresponding to two particle spin states (contrast to paramagnetic resonance in regular spin-polarized electron gas). We analyze the widths of these resonances caused by scattering on the disorder and show that, in contrast with the ballistic regime, in the presence of impurities, the polariton scattering on them is twofold: scattering on the impurity potential directly and scattering on the spatially fluctuating condensate density caused by the disorder. As a result, the width of the resonance associated with the Bose-condensed spin state can be surprizingly narrow in comparison with the width of the resonance associated with the non-condensed state.

Mean ventricular activation times (T*MEAN), spatial dispersions (D*S) between recording channels/cardiac cycle, and maximum activation times (T*MAX) representing the slowest possible conduction in any given heart were all higher in old male Scn 5 a+/− compared with young male and old female Scn 5 a+/− and old male WT. <b>Temporal</b> <b>dispersions</b> (D*T) of recording channels were similarly higher in old male Scn 5 a+/− compared with old male WT.
