30|$|To monitor {{melanosis}} in <b>the</b> samples, 14 <b>shrimps</b> {{were placed}} on a polystyrene tray (8 × 8 in. 2) and covered with shrink film. Thereafter, the samples were stored at 4 °C for 7 days. The samples were taken every day for melanosis assessment. Melanosis or blackening of pre-cooked shrimp was evaluated through visual inspection by ten trained panelists using a 10 -point scoring test following the method of Montero et al. (2001) with some modifications. To prepare <b>the</b> references, <b>shrimp</b> stored at 4 °C for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days were cooked to obtain the core temperature of 60 °C for 1 min. Those samples were used as the references with melanosis scores of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Training was conducted for two sessions. Panelists were asked to give the melanosis score (0 to 10), where 0 = complete absence of black spots, 2 = slight (up to 20 % of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp’s</b> surface is affected), 4 = moderate (20 % to 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp’s</b> surface is affected), 6 = notable (40 % to 60 % of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp’s</b> surface is affected), 8 = severe (60 % to 80 % of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp’s</b> surface is affected), and 10 = extremely heavy (80 % to 100 % of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp’s</b> surface is affected).|$|R

It {{has been reported that}} the EMS is likely due to Vibrio parahaemolitycus that are infected by certain virus (phage), and then the bacteria releasing very toxic substances (toxin). Efforts has been being done by the Indonesian government, especially in the Fish Quarantine Office, Kls II, Tarakan in the form of prohibition of entry of live and/or frozen <b>shrimps</b> importing from <b>the</b> EMS-outbreak country.

5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly not highly active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, {{are known to be}} consumed. Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), squid (Loligo) and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of <b>the</b> <b>shrimp</b> Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. <b>The</b> <b>shrimp</b> Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms are the most important prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and <b>the</b> <b>shrimp</b> Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes <b>the</b> <b>shrimp.</b>|$|E

5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls meant for <b>the</b> <b>shrimp</b> Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen {{regard it as}} a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on <b>the</b> <b>shrimp</b> Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E

Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>shrimp</b> population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has {{had to deal with the}} closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
