5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E

5|$|Wright met {{his last}} girlfriend, Pamela Wright (the shared surname is a coincidence), in 2001 in Felixstowe, {{and they moved}} {{to the house in}} Ipswich {{together}} in 2004. Wright had always admitted that he had used prostitutes, firstly whilst in the Merchant Navy, and continuously throughout his life. Investigations into other crimes Wright might have committed continue, including the possibility of an involvement in the Suzy Lamplugh disappearance. However Metropolitan Police have stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a strong line of enquiry.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{to be taken}} literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means {{that he had the}} ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest. The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simply for dramatic effect, but {{reflects the fact that}} after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by {{the image of her}} step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E

5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{was raised}} on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, {{shortly after the}} start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was {{established}} at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and most of those were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average age on formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessarily accurate as men were found to have altered their ages both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon.|$|E
