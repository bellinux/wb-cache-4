40|$|Children {{as young}} as 3 years can {{remember}} an object’s location within an arrangement and can retrieve it from a novel viewpoint (Nardini, Burgess, Breckenridge, & Atkinson, 2006). However, this ability is impaired if <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> is rotated {{to compensate for the}} novel viewpoint, or, if <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> is rotated and children stand still. There are two dominant explanations for this phenomenon: Self-motion induces an automatic spatial updating process which is beneficial if children move around <b>the</b> <b>arrangement,</b> but misleading if the children’s movement is matched by <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> and not activated if children stand still and only <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> is moved (see spatial updating; Simons & Wang, 1998). Another explanation concerns reference frames: Spatial representations might depend on peripheral spatial relations concerning the surrounding room instead on proximal relations within <b>the</b> <b>arrangement,</b> even if these proximal relations are sufficient or more informative. To evaluate these possibilities, we rotated children (N = 120) aged between 3 and 6 years with an occluded <b>arrangement.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> was in misalignment to the surrounding room, 3 - and 4 -year-olds’ spatial memory was impaired and 5 -year-olds’ was lightly impaired suggesting that they relied on peripheral references of the surrounding room for retrieval.
