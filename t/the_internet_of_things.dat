40|$|Abstract — Information {{security}} {{is becoming a}} major concern for most worldwide telecommunication companies and more so as we move towards <b>the</b> future <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> In this era, a plethora of digital devices, people and other physical objects {{have the potential to}} seamlessly connect and interact on <b>the</b> future <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> This paper takes a leap forward to proactively discuss the type of threats that we are likely to face in <b>the</b> future <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things.</b> We discuss scenarios of how a botnet of stoves can bring down a power grid, future life threatening health systems and how a distributed denial of service can be used to beat competition and increase revenues of Telcos...|$|R

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{the past}} few years, the study on <b>the</b> {{technology}} <b>of</b> <b>internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> (IOT) has become a hot topic {{of the field of}} science at home and abroad. In the filed of farm products logistics, <b>the</b> technology <b>of</b> <b>internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> can effectively track, trace and manage the farm products in the supply chain of logistics; suppliers can acquire the real-time sales status of farm products so as to adjust production and supply of farm products in time; consumers can query the production process and detailed information in order to ensure the quality of farm products. Via <b>the</b> technology <b>of</b> <b>internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> we can not only trace each link of supply chain of farm products and share information, but also analyze the current situation of farm products; we can predict the probability of accident, take measures in a timely and effective manner, and enhance the ability of response mechanism to the market regulation.

25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> is being {{developed}} rapidly without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved and the regulatory changes that might be necessary.|$|E
25|$|In its {{original}} interpretation, {{one of the}} first consequences of implementing <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> by equipping all objects in the world with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers would be to transform daily life.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to increasing concerns over security, <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> Security Foundation (IoTSF) was launched on 23 September 2015. IoTSF has a mission to secure <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> by promoting knowledge and best practice. Its founding board is made from technology providers and telecommunications companies including BT, Vodafone, Imagination Technologies and Pen Test Partners. In addition, large IT companies are continuously developing innovative solutions to ensure the security for IoT devices. As per the estimates from KBV Research, the overall IoT security market would grow at 27.9% rate during 2016–2022 {{as a result of}} growing infrastructural concerns and diversified usage of Internet of things.|$|E
50|$|Systech is {{a member}} of the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) whose {{objective}} is connecting <b>the</b> 25+ billion <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> (IoT) devices across multiple platforms and Operating Systems using a common, interoperable approach that includes security. A recent World Economic Forum report notes the Lack of Interoperability or Standards is the greatest barrier inhibiting business from adopting <b>the</b> Industrial <b>Internet</b> (<b>of</b> <b>Things)</b> along with Security.|$|R
30|$|The {{intelligentization}} {{of shape}} control technology {{needs to be}} closely combined with <b>the</b> industrial <b>internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies.|$|R
30|$|For example, <b>the</b> Industrial <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> (IIoT) R&D {{requires}} new multidisciplinary approaches combining industrial automation, computer science, data communications, instrumentation, {{mechanical engineering}} and process technologies.|$|R
25|$|Security experts view Internet {{of things}} {{as a threat to}} the {{traditional}} Internet. Some argue that market incentive to secure IoT devices is insufficient and increased governmental regulation is necessary to make <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> secure.|$|E
25|$|Philip N. Howard, a {{professor}} and author, writes that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> offers immense potential for empowering citizens, making government transparent, and broadening information access. Howard cautions, however, that privacy threats are enormous, as {{is the potential for}} social control and political manipulation.|$|E

25|$|As a {{practical}} approach, not all elements in <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> {{run in a}} global, public space. Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy, control and reliability. For example, Domestic Robotics (Domotics) running inside a smart home might only share data within and be available via a local network.|$|E
25|$|Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> {{creates an}} {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. Cross-correlation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services. For example, as noted by Danny Meadows-Klue, the combination of analytics for conversion tracking with behavioural targeting has unlocked {{a new level of}} precision that enables display advertising to be focused on the devices of people with relevant interests. Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device interconnectivity, whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> therefore, transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. The wealth of data generated by this industry will allow practitioners in advertising and media to gain an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms used by the industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{applications}} for internet connected devices are extensive. Multiple categorizations have been suggested, {{most of which}} agree on a separation between consumer, enterprise (business), and infrastructure applications. George Osborne, the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, posited that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> is {{the next stage of}} the information revolution and referenced the inter-connectivity of everything from urban transport to medical devices to household appliances.|$|E
