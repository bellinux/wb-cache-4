5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

25|$|On 13 April 2012 it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> attending the sentencing of Gilroy {{would be allowed to}} use live-text based communication services such as Twitter to document events as they happened. This marked only the second time that permission to use Twitter in a Scottish court had been granted. The first occasion was the sentencing diet in HMA v Sheridan and Sheridan. Unlike in England in Wales where the use of Twitter and related services is unrestricted in court, in Scotland, permission needs to be sought from both the trial judge and the Lord Justice General on a case by case basis. The granting of such permission is rare.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is <b>that</b> <b>journalists,</b> commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, {{it should come as no}} surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E

The list's founder acknowledged suggesting <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> write an open letter of support to Quinn {{in response to the}} harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest. Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.|$|E
25|$|Robert Entman, {{professor}} of communication at the George Washington University and critic of mainstream media for decades, indicated {{it was a}} very wise tactic from the Pentagon. He mentioned there were more chances for the journalists to make favorable reports whilst in Iraq with British and American soldiers than if they had been asking questions in Washington. Entman indicated there is a natural cultural bias of American journalists in favor of military troops of their own country and <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> do like to satisfy the government upon which they rely for information, as well as the public on whom they depend commercially. Entman also mentioned the high number of retired generals making comments on TV, pointing out these could not be considered independent experts as they were still paid by the government. He claims the British Broadcasting Corporation was much more neutral and informative on cultural and historical background than most American television reports.|$|E

500|$|When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it {{was shown}} in a private {{screening}} room at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater.

Protesters also appeared at the December 18 Los Angeles screening, where Cruise entered through a tunnel. While the US [...] "red carpet" [...] was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti-Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester's Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters.

500|$|Thatcher's {{successor}} as Prime Minister, John Major, {{announced a}} review of the regulations in November 1993, telling the House of Commons that the general belief within the Conservative Party was that interviews with those subject to the restrictions were being stretched [...] "to the limit and perhaps beyond". His decision followed a television interview with Gerry Adams, which a Conservative MP, Jill Knight, described as having caused [...] "offence to a great number of people". Conservative backbenchers and unionist MPs wanted more rigid restrictions, and The Irish Times reported a [...] "widespread feeling" [...] that Major favoured a complete ban, but <b>that</b> <b>journalists</b> were opposed to this. It quoted the BBC's John Simpson, who said that reporting events from Northern Ireland would become [...] "virtually impossible". At that time coverage of Northern Ireland-related topics was becoming more frequent with the increasing pace of the peace process.

500|$|The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticised FITs {{for their}} {{surveillance}} and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists.

Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of press pass) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued.|$|E
