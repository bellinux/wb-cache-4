40|$|Background: Provisional {{plans of}} the European Union aim for {{increasing}} the right <b>for</b> patients to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> <b>for</b> healthcare. Desired and expected impact of this future ruling is to achieve enhanced patient mobility and to realize effective cooperation and better sharing capacities between different European countries. However, {{the number of patients}} that goes abroad to consume healthcare is relatively small. In this study, it is examined whether people are actually willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> <b>for</b> healthcare and under what conditions. These conditions will provide insights in whether and how patient mobility can be influenced. Methods: Data were obtained from an insurants’ panel that consists of over 10 500 insurants from one particular Dutch health insurer. Several questions were posed to 1500 panel members to examine if people were willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> <b>for</b> health services in three different circumstances: (i) in case, they can be treated by a highly reputable specialist abroad; (ii) to avoid national waiting lists; and (iii) in case, healthcare is provided cheaper abroad. Results: Preliminary results from the insurants’ panel show that a majority is willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> <b>for</b> treatment provided by a highly reputable specialist (65 %) and when it can reduce waiting times in the home country (60 %). If treatment is provided for a lower price across the border, 36 % reported {{that they are willing to}} <b>travel</b> <b>abroad.</b> Conclusions: People do not reject the idea of <b>travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> <b>for</b> healthcare. Most of the respondents reported that they are willing to go abroad in case they can be treated sooner and by specialized healthcare providers. It seems that a majority of people cannot be encouraged to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> when healthcare is lower priced. An important conclusion with policy implications is that people attach strong value to effective and high-graded healthcare and less to the financial aspects. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
