5|$|In 1967 the Ministry of Transport invited {{construction}} company Freeman Fox, Wilbur Smith Associates (FFWSA) {{to investigate and}} report {{on the impact of}} the New Town proposals on <b>traffic</b> <b>demand</b> between the proposed New Town site and Wolverhampton, and the best highway solution to meet this demand. The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 Corridor to the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway grade separated standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E

40|$|In static lightpath allocation, {{the logical}} {{topology}} of a WDM mesh network is determined, {{based on the}} long-term <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> These <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> change with time. When a logical topology is incapable of supporting the current <b>traffic</b> <b>demands,</b> the logical topology has to be changed. The change is made by adding a minimum number of edges to the logical topology. The objective {{of this research is}} to find an optimal new Logical Topology which can support the current <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> with as little change to the existing topology as possible. We have proposed a Hill-Climbing algorithm to solve the reconfiguration problem of logical topologies in WDM networks. Our problem can be divided into two sub-problems. The first is to find an optimal logical topology and the second is to route the traffic optimally on the logical topology.

40|$|Abstract — Campus and {{enterprise}} wireless {{networks are}} increasingly characterized by ubiquitous coverage and rising <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> Efficiently assigning channels to access points (APs) in these networks can significantly affect {{the performance and}} capacity of the wireless LAN. Several research studies have tackled this issue. However, even the state-of-the-art approaches assign channels without considering prevailing <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> The channel assignment problem has a parallel in the wireline world, where recent work has established the tremendous effectiveness of using <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> in network engineering decisions. Motivated by this, our paper explores whether {{the quality of a}} channel assignment can be improved by incorporating observed <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> at APs and clients into the assignment process. Using extensive simulations over publicly-available wireless traffic traces, as well as synthetic settings, we show that being traffic-aware could substantially improve the overall quality of a channel assignment. We develop and evaluate practical trafficaware assignment algorithms that predict future demands based on historical information and use the predicted demands for assigning channels. Finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of traffic-aware assignment using testbed experiments. I...|$|R

25|$|Bangkok's {{rapid growth}} in the 1980s {{resulted}} in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and <b>traffic</b> <b>demand,</b> which have since continued—in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles. These increases, {{in the face of}} limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s. The extent of the problem is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time. While Bangkok's limited road surface area (8 percent, compared to 20–30 percent in most Western cities) is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams, other factors, including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level, inadequate public transport systems, and lack of transportation demand management, also play a role. Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways, as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems. The city's overall traffic conditions, however, remain bad.|$|E

As {{the quality of}} rail transport continued to deteriorate, {{in part because of}} the Russian Civil War, some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if congestions continued to increase. Those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis. The majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used. There were even some who believed in the recapitalisation of the railways. Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated for the rationalisation of the railways, coupled with tariffs based on actual cost, which would reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>demand</b> and provide funds for investment. The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate. In 1931, in a Central Committee (CC) resolution, it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis. This resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate.|$|E

40|$|In IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} LANs, the DCF {{access method}} and the PCF access method operate alternatively within a superframe {{to service the}} time-varying <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> Due to different medium access mechanisms deployed by DCF and PCF, they work well for some particular types of traffic scenarios respectively, while their performance may degrade under some other types of <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> None of them can keep high performance under all types of <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> In this paper, we propose an adaptive control al-gorithm to keep the aggregate throughput of access points close to the best capacity of both DCF mode and PCF mode upon various traffic requests, by dynamically adjusting the duration of DCF mode and PCF mode within a superframe based on recent traffic scenarios in wireless LANs. We mod-ified the MAC module of IEEE 802. 11 wireless LANs in OPNET to support our algorithm. Extensive simulations have been done using OPNET.

40|$|The future Internet {{will require}} the {{transport}} {{of a wide range}} of services including high bandwidth one-to-many applications, with a dynamic interconnection of devices. WDM layer support realizes such services in a transparent, reliable and efficient way. Most of the recent studies have been focused on efficiently building and configuring light-paths for unicast or light-trees for multicast in isolation, and do not take existing <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> and configuration into consideration. In this paper we consider a dynamic design problem of integrated traffic in a realistic WDM mesh network. In such a network, new <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> of either multicast and/or unicast are supported dynamically in the presence of an existing mixture of traffic. The amount of bandwidth per wavelength is abundant, while the wavelengths and light splitting capabilities on WDM switches are limited. Using subwavelength sharing among <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> of unicast and multicast, we build a hybrid virtual topology that exploits both existing light-trees and light-paths. By optimizing WDM resources in addition to resource sharing with existing unicast and multicast demands, we truly maximize the WDM layer capability and efficiently support more <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> We validate the efficiency of our approach with extensive simulations on various network topologies...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{transmit}} {{or receive}} (MTR) capability is a promising approach that significantly improves {{the capacity of}} Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). A fundamental problem is deriving a minimal link schedule or superframe that satisfies <b>traffic</b> <b>demands.</b> Existing MTR link schedulers or works that jointly consider routing and scheduling in wireless networks assume <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> are known in advance and are fixed. However, in practice, <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> {{are likely to be}} uncertain. Consequently, any computed solution will lead to either idle slots or congestion. Moreover, uncertain demands may cause a network operator to compute and install a new routing and superframe frequently; this is likely to incur high signaling overheads, especially in large scale multi-hop WMNs. Henceforth, in this paper, we consider random <b>traffic</b> <b>demands</b> characterized by a polyhedral set. We model the problem as a semi-infinite Linear Program (LP). We then propose a novel heuristic algorithm, called Algo-PolyH, that jointly considers both routing and superframe generation to produce a robust solution that is valid for all random demands that belong to a given polyhedral set. This fact is confirmed in our evaluation of Algo-PolyH in networks with varying number of degrees, number of flows, number of nodes and number of paths...|$|R
