2500|$|The {{amount of}} {{potential}} performance areas on-stage, {{as well as}} the size of the video cage, dictated the lighting system. Three trusses were suspended over the main stage housing just 16 lighting fixtures, with additional trusses lengthwise following the edge of the arena floor. The most heavily used lighting fixtures were PRG Best Boys and Bad Boys, providing both wash and spot lighting; wishing to minimize the amount of fixtures used, Williams chose them because of their output and <b>throw</b> <b>distance.</b> Due to the lack of a traditional [...] "front of house" [...] for the stage design, Williams was concerned how to handle spotlights, but he settled on using a ring of truss Bad Boy spotlights with the brightest bulbs that could be used without melting. The lighting of the main stage was meant to evoke a punk rock club from the late 1970s and early 1980s, a time and place that provided the thematic setting for the beginning of the Innocence + Experience shows. Additional lighting was built into the underside of the video cage.|$|E
2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and lens assembly. [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In ellipsoidal reflector spotlights (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the <b>throw</b> <b>distance</b> (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|E

To clarify {{the influence of}} the physique on the throwing ability, the relationships between physique and <b>throwing</b> <b>distance,</b> as well as ball speed were investigated. The subjects were fourty-nine high school baseball players, and thirty-eight high school volleyball players, football players and canoeists served as a control group. The <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> was significantly related to lean body mass (r=. 290), chest girth (r=. 416), upper arm girth (r=. 307), abdominal girth (r=. 288), thigh girth (r=. 327) and lower leg girth (r=. 285) in baseball players group (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01). A significant relationship between the <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> and foot length in control group (r=. 329, p< 0. 05) was demonstrated. Significant relationships between ball speed and standing height in the baseball players group (r=. 354, p< 0. 01) and that between ball speed and Impedance in the control group (r=-. 288, p< 0. 05) were ovserved. These findings indicate that the <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> is influenced by quantity of body muscle in baseball players.

There are mainly three major factors affecting throwing distance: the initial velocity (v, m/s), release angle (A, °) and release height (h, m) in shot push. So far, it is common to use the physical kinematics knowledge in the research of shot putting, but the release height’s impact on the <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> is rarely considered.

40|$|This {{study was}} to examine {{overhand}} throwing motions of adult women. Eleven physical fitness test items and measurement of <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> (using softball) were administerd to 96 adult female students. The multiple regression equation to estimate <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> was calculated by the stepwise method. The differences between estimated distance and measured distance were calculated. Ten subjects with higher residual were selected as Excellent group, and ten with lower residual were selected as Poor group. Overhand throwing motions of selected subjects were filmed simultaneously from side and overhead view by two cameras. Dynamic variables such as displacement, time, velocity, angle and angular velocity were obtained from film analysis. Excellent group showed longer <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> (p< 0. 01), while {{there was no significant difference}} in fitness test items between two groups. Excellent group showed higher initial velocity of ball at release (p< 0. 01). Judging from these results, it seems that longer <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> was caused by higher initial velocity of ball, and higher initial velocity of ball was produced by rational throwing motions. Characteristics of rational overhand throwing motions of adult women which were verified in this study were as follows: 1) greater backward rotation of shoulder of throwing-hand side in the horizontal plane during preparatory phase (step motion), 2) greater back-swing of throwing-hand during preparatory phase, 3) faster forward rotation of shoulder of throwing-hand side in the horizontal plane during throwing phase (from front foot contact to ball release), 4) skillful whip-like action, 5) well-timed wrist (snap) action. The results of this study suggest that five these points should be emphasized in motor learning of throwing for adult women...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to clarify the possibility of progress of throwing ability on adult females, and to examine effective instructional methods of throwing. Twenty-four female students who had no special experiences of motor learning of throwing were divided into three groups; two training groups (WI group: throwing exercise with verbal instruction and demonstration, and NI group: throwing exercise without instruction) and one control group. Training was carried out three days per week for four weeks. Measuring physical fitness and analyzing throwing motions were performed before and after the training period. In the WI group, <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> increased significantly from 24. 38 m to 30. 38 m. Actions of arm and legs during preparatory phase of throwing were changed, consequently factors of action at starting of main phase of throwing were also changed. It seemed that these changes leaded to faster forward rotation of shoulder during main phase of throwing, skillful whip-like action and wrist action. In the NI group, <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> increased from 24. 67 m to 27. 17 m insignificantly. Remarkable changes of throwing motions were not recognized except for the increase of range of shoulder rotation.

Data were retrieved after recording seven right-handed throwers (age: 28. 8 ± 4. 1 years, body height: 1. 94 ± 0. 09 m, body mass: 119. 4 ± 11. 6 kg) with a Casio EX-FX 1 (Casio Computer Co.

The relationships among the duration of the technique phases of the throw and the official <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> were examined with Pearson Correlation Analysis using the SPSS 10. 0. 1 software (SPSS Inc.).

The temporal and correlation analyses were in agreement with previous studies. The dominant style of release was the release with no support on the ground. The majority of the throwers spent a larger percentage of the delivery turn (transition, delivery and release phases) being in single than in double support. It was noted that a short duration of the transition phase, combined with lower values of the ratio of the time spent for the starting turn compared to the time spent for the delivery turn might be favorable regarding the achievement of a larger <b>throwing</b> <b>distance...</b>|$|R

Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of the forage harvester could allow a farm to reduce costs by using a smaller tractor that is less expensive and more efficient. The objective {{of this research was}} to increase the <b>throwing</b> <b>distance</b> of a forage harvester by modeling the flow of forage in the spout and the air flow in the blower and spout.

The simulation results of air velocities and flow patterns were compared to experimental values and it was found that both were of the same order of magnitude with the model predicting slightly higher air velocities than those measured. The flow of forage in the spout was modeled analytically by taking into account the friction between the forage and the spout surface and the aerodynamic resistance after the forage leaves the spout. From this model, two improved prototype spouts that should theoretically result in longer <b>throwing</b> <b>distances</b> were designed.
