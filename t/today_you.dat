500|$|Economics is {{no longer}} a fit {{conversation}} piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts some people who are more interested in the technique than the subject. That is too bad, but it may be inevitable.

That is why, if you consult [...] looking for enlightenment about the world <b>today,</b> <b>you</b> will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Arsenal's defeat, Wenger {{felt that}} [...] " [...] {{is not too}} important. We have won four Community Shields and no-one regards it as a trophy so I do not mind anymore." [...] He felt Chelsea's game plan was [...] "very direct" [...] and {{admitted}} Drogba gave his team [...] "a hard time on the long balls". Wenger absolved Senderos of any blame for the two goals – [...] "it would be unfair" [...] – and believed Fàbregas showed why he was a capable replacement for Patrick Vieira, who left in the summer: [...] "He controlled the game and for me was outstanding." [...] When {{asked if he was}} worried about Chelsea, Wenger retorted: [...] "Did you see the game <b>today?</b> <b>You</b> can be worried if you are a Chelsea supporter," [...] an indirect reference to their style of football.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Hollis {{hoped that}} the {{difference}} between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007, but it {{was not included in the}} final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, commenting in 2006 that [...] "Even <b>today,</b> <b>you</b> can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. I suspect it will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." [...] Although not all these intended features were realised, the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles.|$|E

Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best."

[...] With a worldwide revenue of , Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha {{as one of the}} best films of the decade with women protagonists.

The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers <b>today,</b> <b>you</b> know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store.

500|$|Lage Raho Munna Bhai was an {{acclaimed}} film. Subhash K. Jha {{said that}} [...] "Munna and Circuit, arguably cinema's most adorable and roguish reformists since Laurel and Hardy go {{about the business}} of generating humour out of the pathos of the human condition. The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the love-lorn Munnabhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out five stars, calling it [...] "a sparkling example of qualitative cinema" [...] arguing that it [...] "not only entertains, it also enlightens." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that [...] "Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel..." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated <b>today,</b> <b>you</b> cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both {{to the quality of the}} writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own." [...] Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it [...] "cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the déjà vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year." [...] He commended the it for showing [...] "the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage [...] raho, guys." ...|$|E
