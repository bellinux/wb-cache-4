5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> rounds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the operation, Bismarcks crew had {{increased}} to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, Bismarck departed Gotenhafen and made for the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by Prinz Eugen, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.|$|E

5|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, when Earl Páll herd of Earl Rögnvaldr's {{arrival in}} Shetland, he held council {{and decided to}} {{immediately}} gather forces and attack Earl Rögnvaldr before he could be reinforced by the incoming men he knew were coming from the Suðreyjar. That night Earl Páll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships—this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to Rousay, where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further strengthened by arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl Rögnvaldr, about <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> ships were spotted coming from the Pentland Firth. Earl Páll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frakökk and Ölvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Ölvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl Páll was further strengthened by a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Banff Wing quickly forced German ships {{travelling}} {{along the}} Norwegian coast to sail {{at night and}} take shelter in deep fjords during the day where they were very difficult to attack. In order to locate German ships the two wings sent out aircraft on almost daily patrols along the Norwegian coastline from the Skagerrak to Trondheim. During this period the Allied squadrons developed a tactic of sending two 'outriders' ahead of {{the main body of}} the patrol; these aircraft were manned by experienced aircrew and penetrated into fjords in search of shipping which might not be spotted by the other aircraft. By December 1944 patrols were also routinely escorted by RAF Mustang Mk III fighters and accompanied by Vickers Warwick air-sea rescue aircraft. Only a single squadron of Mustangs was available, however, as these long-ranged fighters were needed to escort daylight raids by heavy bombers against Germany. German fighters began to be encountered off the Norwegian coast in December, and from the end of the month onwards it was common for Allied wing-sized operations near Norway to be attacked by groups of up to 30 fighters. In March 1945 the Luftwaffe had 85 single-engined and about 45 twin-engined aircraft operating from <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> airfields south of Trondheim.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{references}} to goals come from England {{in the late}} 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to [...] "goals" [...] in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: [...] "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> foote asunder; and directly against them, <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> twelue <b>twelve</b> score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".

25|$|During Hiroshige’s time, {{the print}} {{industry}} was booming, {{and the consumer}} audience for prints was growing rapidly.

A medium-sized band may have, besides the aforementioned guitar, a cavaquinho (that plays the chords rhythmically), a <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> string guitar (popularly called “viola” in Cape Verde, that provides an harmonic support), a solo instrument besides the singer’s voice and some percussion instrument. A bigger band may have another guitar, an acoustic bass guitar, {{more than one}} solo instrument (violin, clarinet, trumpet, etc.) and several percussion instruments (shaker, güiro, bongos, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In Turkish cuisine, wheat-based mixed dessert congee {{is called}} an ashure. It {{is a little}} similar with eight {{ingredient}} Chinese congee.

Alevi communities cook it at the tenth day of Muharrem, which is the first month of the İslamic calendar. It is a common dessert in Turkey, Greece and Albania.|$|E
50|$|All National Curriculum {{subjects}} are studied, and {{the curriculum is}} enhanced to provide creative opportunities in drama and dance and support for all aspects of personal development in PSHE. From early on, the sciences are taught separately to support {{the large number of}} pupils who choose biology, chemistry and physics as A level options. Teaching groups are of the same age and, generally, of mixed ability. As in all secondary schools, pupils sit most of their GCSE Examinations in Year 11, although more flexible pathways enable early entry in some disciplines, for example Mathematics. Pupils currently take <b>ten,</b> eleven <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> GCSEs, and up to five A levels in Year 13.|$|R

50|$|Mixed {{dentition}} stage starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at five or six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at <b>ten,</b> eleven, <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> years. There are 32 permanent teeth {{and those of the}} maxillae erupt in a different order from permanent mandibular teeth. Maxillary teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. While this is the most common eruption order, variation is not uncommon.|$|R

25|$|On 17 August 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane {{detached}} Devastation, Euryalus, Ætna, Meteor, Manly and Erebus, {{all under}} Captain Alexander Gordon in Seahorse, {{to go up}} the Potomac and bombard Fort Washington, which was on the left bank of the river, some <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> miles below Washington itself. The British suffered from several disadvantages. First, they lacked pilots that knew the Kettle-Bottoms, a difficult stretch of the river. Second, the winds blew in the wrong direction, slowing their advance. Consequently, it took them ten days to reach the fort, and during the journey all the ships grounded at least 20 times. For five successive days they had to warp over a distance of 50 miles.|$|E
25|$|Some princely states, such as {{the major}} Salute state of Travancore, were {{perceived}} not to ever have sanctioned sati within their domains. For example, the regent Gowri Parvati Bayi {{was asked by the}} British Resident if he should permit a sati to take place in 1818, but the regent urged him not to do so, since the custom of sati had never been acceptable in her domains. In another state, Sawunt Waree (Sawantvadi), the king Khemsawant III (r. 1755–1803) is credited for having issued a positive prohibition of sati over a period of <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> years. That prohibition from the 18th century may have lapsed, since in 1843, the government in Sawunt Waree issued a new prohibition of sati.|$|E
2500|$|A knightly duel in {{this period}} usually {{consisted}} in three courses of jousting, and three blows and strokes exchanged with battle-axes, swords, and daggers. [...] This number tended to be extended {{towards the end of}} the century, until the most common number was five, as in the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden and Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387 (cinq lances a cheval, cinq coups d'épée, cinq coups de dague et cinq coups de hache). Later could be as high as <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> even <b>twelve.</b> [...] In the 1387 encounter, the first four courses of the joust were run without decisive outcome, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lost consciousness. He was revived, however, and all the strokes and blows could be duly exchanged, without any further injury.|$|R
25|$|The poems used in most Kurdish {{music are}} filled with stories of romance and unrequited love. These poems have often two verses, which are divided in <b>ten,</b> eleven, <b>or</b> <b>twelve</b> syllables, and {{are based on the}} Gathas of the Zoroastrians. Kurdish melodies are very simple; their range is usually {{confined}} to a few notes. The form of the music is often strophic, and every gourani has a particular melody that is sung with various stanzas. At the end of every stanza the strophe is repeated unchanged throughout the song. Every gourani is characterized by a specific strophe. Similar to a lied or a chanson, gouranis may be accompanied by instrumental sections, which have three parts: prelude, middle section, and the ending. The prelude and the ending are performed by the group, and the middle section is performed in the form of call and response.|$|R
