40|$|This {{project was}} an attempt to {{identify}} the roles and responsibilities of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> in Australia. It has been presumed that they are a homogeneous group with identical goals, objectives and methods. This study investigated if this was the case and challenges the assumptions of this perception. Such an exercise had not been attempted in this country nor overseas. Using a questionnaire, the research aim was to investigate whether their perceptions and experience vary and if it is possible to create a profile of the <b>typical</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Manager.</b> The research study assessed the education, career progression, job content and reward perceptions of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> in 1, 000 Australian organisations which are registered with the Quality Assurance Services. This was a similar approach as in the study by D'Netto, Sohal and Trevillyan (1996) regarding Production Managers and the results may also be used to compare and contrast the experience of <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> with those of production/operations managers as identified in their report. The data has been collated and analysed and a managerial role responsibilities framework has been suggested which may represent the complex activities of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> and which may be used as a valuable database by Human Resources Managers in their strategic planning for continuous improvement. Such a study is conspicuous by its absence. It is an area that has been overlooked in the push for a competitive advantage but a thorough understanding of the roles and responsibilities of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> is crucial for successful implementation of quality management...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>quality</b> <b>manager</b> {{has evolved}} from being a quality {{controller}} {{to work with a}} more global business. Within many organizations in Sweden, however, the traditional role of the <b>quality</b> <b>manager's</b> remains and the tasks categorized as quality control still takes up most of the <b>quality</b> <b>manager's</b> time. The survey conducted as part of this master thesis shows that the <b>quality</b> <b>manager</b> in most businesses has multiple roles in addition to the role of <b>quality</b> <b>manager,</b> which can create a role conflict. One consequence of this is that each improvement is not given priority due to time constraints. Although the importance of a clear and committed leadership is the key for succeeding as the <b>quality</b> <b>manager.</b> The <b>quality</b> <b>manager’s</b> educational background can vary between different activities. Most <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> have a basic training in business development and quality, but many do not have deep expertise in the area. The <b>quality</b> <b>manager</b> wants more education and is looking for deeper skills for living in a constantly learning. The master thesis identifies the <b>quality</b> <b>manager's</b> role, tasks and education. It is hoped {{that in the long run}} from this study could support the <b>quality</b> <b>manager's</b> role and future development in the debate...|$|R

This naturally includes {{the role of the}} <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> and it appears as if the profession of <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> is at a crossroads. Alternatives are that the role of a <b>quality</b> <b>manager</b> broadens to include quality at a strategic level in the firm and that Six Sigma specialists and Lean Production managers drive the development of quality management in the future. In this paper, we present the results from a survey of 212 <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> in Swedish organisations. The purpose is to contribute to an understanding of how the management of quality is designed and practised in contemporary organisations. This study shows that a <b>quality</b> <b>manager's</b> operational responsibility is quite narrowly defined. The agenda of the <b>quality</b> <b>manager</b> is mainly related to quality standards, such as ISO 9000 and environmental management systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study aimed at investigating how managers in small supplying firms translate their vision of quality as a strategic tool into a set of principles, practices, and techniques that shape the firm quality-based strategy in the customer-supplier relationship. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from a sample of 139 small suppliers. Three groups of firms were uncovered, associated to three conceptualisations of quality denominated ‘process-oriented’, ‘market-oriented’, and ‘product-oriented’. Results show that: 1) there is a positive association between industry type and the vision of quality as a strategic leverage; 2) there is a positive association between the <b>managers</b> <b>quality</b> vision and the commitment of supplier firms to pursue a quality-based strategy through the implementation of quality-related practices; 3) there is a positive association between the supplier <b>managers</b> <b>quality</b> vision and the customer-supplier relationship pattern.
