25|$|MC firms sell {{products}} that have real or perceived non-price differences. However, {{the differences are}} not so great as to eliminate other goods as substitutes. Technically, the cross price elasticity of demand between goods in such a market is positive. In fact, the XED would be high. MC goods are best described as close but imperfect substitutes. The goods perform the same basic functions but have differences in qualities such as <b>type,</b> <b>style,</b> quality, reputation, appearance, and location that tend to distinguish them from each other. For example, the basic function of motor vehicles is the same—to move people and objects from point to point in reasonable comfort and safety. Yet {{there are many different}} types of motor vehicles such as motor scooters, motor cycles, trucks and cars, and many variations even within these categories.|$|E
500|$|According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek {{historian}} and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented {{the final stage}} {{in the development of}} Attic prose. Both Dionysius and Cicero assert that Demosthenes brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal <b>type</b> <b>style</b> ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters.* C. Wooten, [...] "Cicero's Reactions to Demosthenes", 39. He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work.|$|E

40|$|Thai typed {{character}} recognition {{has been a}} very most popular research topic in Thailand. There are three commercial Thai OCR softwares available to the public at the present. But none of them can preserve the <b>type</b> <b>styles</b> of the original document image such as bold, italics, normal, and bold & italics styles into the output text file. This paper presents the technique for preserving the specified Thai <b>type</b> <b>styles</b> by applying a specific preprocessing with a supervised neural networks (NNs) learning algorithm. Experiments have been conducted and the results confirm that the proposed technique effectively preserve the <b>type</b> <b>styles</b> of Thai <b>typed</b> fonts from the original document image into the output text file. 1...|$|R
40|$|We take {{a closer}} look at {{keyboard}} acoustic emanations specifically for the purpose of eavesdropping over random passwords. In this scenario, dictionary and HMM language models are not applicable; the attacker can only utilize the raw acoustic information which has been recorded. We investigate several existing signal processing techniques for our purpose, and introduce a novel technique – time-frequency decoding – that improves the detection accuracy compared to previous techniques. We also carefully examine the effect of <b>typing</b> <b>style</b> – a crucial variable largely ignored by prior research – on the detection accuracy. Our results show that using the same <b>typing</b> <b>style</b> (hunt and peck) for both training and decoding the data, the best case success rate for detecting correctly the typed key is 64 % per character. The results also show that changing the <b>typing</b> <b>style,</b> to touch <b>typing,</b> during the decoding stage reduces the success rate, but using the time-frequency technique, we can still achieve a success rate of around 40 % per character. Our work takes the keyboard acoustic attack one step further, bringing it closer to a full-fledged vulnerability under realistic scenarios (different <b>typing</b> <b>styles</b> and random passwords). Our results suggest that while the performance of these attacks degrades under such conditions, it is still possible, utilizing the time-frequency technique, to considerably reduce the exhaustive search complexity of retrieving a random password...|$|R

Along with the new {{corporate logo}}, a new <b>type</b> <b>style</b> - MALAYSIA, was created. It is italicised to slant parallel with the logo to accentuate speed as well as direction. Within this corporate typestyle, the letters M, A and S bear red clippings to denote the initials of the statutory name of the airline, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). They were added after the original design was rejected by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad. [...] The introduction of blue to the original red logo has national significance.

40|$|<b>Typing</b> <b>styles</b> vary among {{keyboard}} users; however {{few studies}} have investigated the association between <b>typing</b> <b>style</b> and <b>typing</b> speed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the differences in typing speed be-tween typists who rarely assume extreme postures of the wrist, hands, and fingers with typists who often assume extreme postures. The paper also examines the association between other typing behaviors, such as using a wrist support, and typing speed. Forty computer users were videotaped while typing a standardized text. Their typing postures were rated using the Keyboard Personal Computer Style instrument (K-PeCS). One-way ANOVAs were used to compare typing speed between the rating levels of several items on the K-PeCS. Results suggest that those who frequently isolate their 5 th digit are significantly faster than those who always isolate their 5 th digit. Subjects who float their wrists, translate their wrist/hands, do not change pro-nation angles, use moderate to high force, and use more digits appear to type faster than those who do not. Keyboard users have developed a variety of <b>typing</b> <b>styles</b> to more efficiently access their keyboards. Touch <b>typing</b> is one <b>style</b> that has long been taught as a method to in-crease typing speed. The touch typing method advocates specific postures and actions; typists are taught to floa...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships between thinking styles and achievement motivation among Chinese university students. The Thinking Styles Inventory - Revised (TSI-R; Sternberg, Wagner, & Zhang, 2003) and the Achievement Motives Scale (AMS; Gjesme & Nygard, 1970; Ye & Hagtvet, 1988) were administered to 238 Chinese university students from Shanghai, the People's Republic of China. Results largely supported {{the hypothesis that the}} more creativity-generating and complex thinking <b>styles</b> (<b>Type</b> I <b>styles)</b> were positively correlated with achievement motivation to approach success (MS), and negatively correlated with achievement motivation to avoid failure (MF). Results partially supported the hypothesis that the more norm-favoring and simplistic thinking <b>styles</b> (<b>Type</b> II <b>styles)</b> had negative correlation with MS, and positive correlation with MF. The study also found that the situation-/task-dependent thinking <b>styles</b> (<b>Type</b> III <b>styles)</b> were positively correlated with MS, and negatively correlated with MF.
