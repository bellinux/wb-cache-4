40|$|The <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>voltage</b> {{developed}} {{across an}} atomic metal junction (i. e., a nanostructure {{in which one}} or a few atoms connect two metal electrodes) in response to a temperature difference between the electrodes, results from the quantum interference of electrons that pass through the junction multiple times after being scattered by the surrounding defects. Here we report successfully tuning this quantum interference and thus controlling the magnitude and sign of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>voltage</b> by applying a mechanical force that deforms the junction. The observed switching of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>voltage</b> is reversible and can be cycled many times. Our ab initio and semi-empirical calculations elucidate the detailed mechanism by which the quantum interference is tuned.

Because thermoelectricity, or Seebeck effect, is associated with heat-induced electron diffusion, how the thermoelectric signal {{is related to the}} atomic-scale wavefunctions and what the role of the temperature is at such a length scale remain very unclear. Here we show that coherent electron and heat transport through a point-like contact produces an atomic Seebeck effect, which is described by mesoscopic Seebeck coefficient multiplied with an effective temperature drop at the interface. The mesoscopic Seebeck coefficient is approximately proportional to the logarithmic energy derivative of local density of states at the Fermi energy. We deduced that the effective temperature drop at the tip-sample junction could vary at a sub-angstrom scale depending on atom-to-atom interaction at the interface.

The electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient are measured in the high temperature range [300, 400] K using a Van der Pauw four-point probe technique. We find that the electrical resistivity decreases exponentially with increasing temperature following an activated behavior corresponding to a band-gap of E_g≈ 2 eV, indicating that epitaxial YIG ultra-thin films behave as large gap semiconductor, and not as electrical insulator. The resistivity drops to about 5 × 10 ^ 3 Ω·cm at T= 400 K. We also infer the Hall mobility, which is found to be positive (p-type) at 5 cm^ 2 /(V·sec) and about independent of temperature. We discuss the consequence for non-local transport experiments performed on YIG at room temperature. These electrical properties are responsible for an offset voltage (independent of the in-plane field direction) whose amplitude, odd in current, grows exponentially with current due to Joule heating.
