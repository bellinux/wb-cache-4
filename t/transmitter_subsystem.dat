40|$|Abstract-Recently, {{arraying}} {{of large}} or small and distributed reflector antennas for uplink applications has attracted attention for a capability upgrade to the Deep Space Network (DSN). This interest {{is driven by the}} desire to maximize the usefulness of existing DSN large apertures in case of spacecraft emergency and to develop the necessary knowledge of how the array of small and distributed reflector antennas can meet other future uplink throughput needs. The primary challenge for uplink arraying of distributed reflector antennas for deep space applications is the lack of feedback from deep space within a reasonably short period. Furthermore, the individual reflectors (and their <b>transmitter</b> <b>subsystems)</b> are thousands of wavelengths apart, which make the phase coherence of individual transmitted signals an extremely challenging task. Because of the return light tim...|$|R

40|$|A {{point-to-point}} link analysis {{model has been}} developed for the Super High Frequency (SHF) Band. It was developed to evaluate ship-to-ship and ship-to-air links. The SHF Link Analysis Model (SLAM) evalutes a communication link and determines system margin.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reliability}} and robustness of electronic subsystems dedicated {{to control and}} communications in the aerospace sector is more than ever {{one of the key}} points for safety and security, essentially during landing operations. As aircraft manufacturers have to diversify their mean of communication system's control (Full-Duplex and System), the reliability can be improved both by setting redundant remote networks, and also by using matched technologies for increased performances and robustness: the wide band-gap Gallium Nitride technology (GaN) newly developed fits perfectly to the requirements of systems such as Microwave Landing System (MLS) or Distance Measuring Equipments (DME) used during the final landing approach. Actually, GaN technology takes advantage of a natural immunity to electromagnetic perturbations, and is suitable for circuit design in the RF frequency band (up to 5 GHz for aircraft applications). The GaN based circuits are able to improve transceiver's efficiency (and so the radio-link budget) thanks to their low noise figure (receiver) and high output power (transmitter), reducing digital bit error rate during the code demodulation. This point is crucial while electronic runs in an urban environment. Moreover, the next electronic systems developed for " composite aircraft " will be more exposed to high electric field and CEM problems in circuits. Furthermore, this GaN integrated technology allows a reduction of volume for <b>transmitter's</b> <b>subsystems,</b> and is easy to setup (aircraft maintenance) : the risk of immobilisation during the aircraft exploitation will be reduced and his maintainability will be easier. Finally, this technology is also perfectly suited for ground navigation control systems such as radar. This work presents the challenge for civil and military future avionic systems by making use of GaN based technologies...|$|R

50|$|MISTRAM was a multistatic long {{baseline}} radar interferometer developed for precision measurements of missile trajectories at the US Air Force Eastern Test Range. Multistatic radar systems {{have a higher}} complexity with multiple <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>subsystems</b> employed in a coordinated manner at more than two sites. All of the geographically dispersed units contribute to the collective target acquisition, detection, position finding and resolution, with simultaneous reception at the receiver sites. In a simpler sense, multistatic radars are systems which have two or more receiving sites with a common spatial coverage area, and data from these coverage areas are combined and processed at a central location. These systems {{are considered to be}} multiple bistatic pairs. Multistatic radar systems have various uses, including prevention of jamming and anti-radar munitions.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} based on ergodic properties for classifying chaotic sequences is given. It is particularly robust {{due to the}} open-loop structure of the detector. Unlike previous works in this direction, such as those concerning the inverse system approach, the detector is not uniquely determined by the <b>transmitter</b> (identical or <b>subsystem</b> thereof), but instead depends on the measurement noise model. The classification is optimized under such imperfect observation conditions. The method is introduced in general for the case of chaotic sequences generated by ergodic maps, and a special case is analyzed in detail to illustrate the method. This special example resorts to Tchebychev maps and some additional symmetries {{to make up a}} simple signaling scheme which is low in complexity on both transmitter and receiver sides, {{while at the same time}} relatively robust, due to the open-loop structure of the detector...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a pair of}} compact CW/FM airborne SAR systems for small UAV-based operation (wingspan of 3. 5 m) for low-cost testing of innovative SAR concepts. Two different SAR instruments, using the C and X bands, have been developed {{in the context of}} the ARBRES project, each of them achieving a payload weight below 5 Kg and a volume of 13. 5 dm 3 (sensor and controller). Every system has a dual receiving channel which allows operation in interferometric or polarimetric modes. Planar printed array antennas are used in both sensors for easy system integration and better isolation between <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>subsystems.</b> First experimental tests on board a 3. 2 m wingspan commercial radio-controlled aircraft are presented.

40|$|In this {{protocol}} and packet format, data traffic is monitored by all network interfaces {{to determine the}} health of <b>transmitter</b> and <b>subsystems.</b> When failures are detected, the network inter face applies its recover y policies to provide continued service {{despite the presence of}} faults. The protocol, packet format, and inter face are independent of the data link technology used. The current demonstration system supports both commercial off-the-shelf wireless connections and wired Ethernet connections. Other technologies such as 1553 or serial data links can be used for the network backbone. The Wireless Avionics packet is divided into three parts: a header, a data payload, and a checksum. The header has the following components: magic number, version, quality of service, time to live, sending transceiver, function code, payload length, source Application Data Interface (ADI) address, destination ADI address, sending node address, target node address, and a sequence number. The magic number is used to identify WAV packets, and allows the packet format to be updated in the future. The quality of service field allows routing decisions to be made based on this value and can be used to route critical management data over a dedicated channel. The time to live value is used to discard misrouted packets while the source transceiver is updated at each hop. This information is used to monitor the health of each transceiver in the network. To identify the packet type, the function code is used. Besides having a regular data packet, the system supports diagnostic packets for fault detection and isolation. The payload length specifies the number of data bytes in the payload, and this supports variable-length packets in the network. The source ADI is the address of the originating interface. This can be used by the destination application to identify the originating source of the packet where the address consists of a subnet, subsystem class within the subnet, a subsystem unit, and the local ADI number. The destination ADI is used to route the packet to its ultimate destination. At each hop, the sending interface uses the destination address to determine the next node for the data. The sending node is the node address of the interface that is broadcasting the packet. This field is used to determine the health of the subsystem that is sending the packet. In the case of a packet that traverses several intermediate nodes, it may be the node address of the intermediate node. The target node is the node address of the next hop for the packet. It may be an intermediate node, or the final destination for the packet. The sequence number is used to identify duplicate packets. Because each interface has multiple transceivers, the same packet will appear at both receivers. The sequence number allows the interface to correlate the reception and forward a single, unique packet for additional processing. The subnet field allows data traffic to be partitioned into segregated local networks to support large networks while keeping each subnet at a manageable size. This also keeps the routing table small enough so routing can be done by a simple table lookup in an FPGA device. The subsystem class identifies members of a set of redundant subsystems, and, in a hot standby configuration, all members of the subsystem class will receive the data packets. Only the active subsystem will generate data traffic. Specific units in a class of redundant units can be identified and, if the hot standby configuration is not used, packets will be directed to a specific subsystem unit...|$|R
