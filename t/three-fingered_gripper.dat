40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a <b>three-fingered</b> <b>gripper</b> with two degrees of freedom (DOF) per finger for a total of six (DOF). We show a brief mathematical description of the kinematics involved in the gripper with which to determine the workspace. With the workspace, all possible attachment points are obtained, that will be the points at which the end-effector contacts with the object geometry. To select which of these points is best for hold the object, we proceed to evaluate the force that is exerted on it by mathematical theory called Screw. This force should be the minimum to ensure that do not present sliding as well as avoid damages of the object by excess strength. Due {{to the fact that the}} contact points are numerous and evaluate them takes quite time by an algorithm combining, for this reason the optimization algorithm Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) is implemented. The results of the optimization with attachment points that exert minimal force were presented...|$|E
40|$|A <b>three-fingered</b> <b>gripper</b> with flexure hinges {{actuated}} by {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA) wires was designed and prototyped. The aim of the work was the manipulation of small, almost cylindrical objects, e. g. test tubes, by a device having small overall dimensions. A parametric study of four different, but similar, fingers was conducted {{with the aim of}} obtaining a solution with a good amplification ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of flexure hinges simplifies the design, but limits the finger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to find a configuration with sufficient work space. Once the finger geometry was defined, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (d 65 x h 65 mm), and the first prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one. Some drawbacks have been highlighted, such as a reduced range of motion and incomplete backstroke; future studies will deal with them...|$|E
40|$|Given {{a desired}} {{function}} for an effector, {{what is its}} appropriate shape? This thesis addresses the problem of designing {{the shape of a}} rigid end effector to perform a given manipulation task. It presents three main contributions: First, it describes the contact kinematics of an effector as the product of both its shape and its motion, and assumes a fixed motion model to explore the role of shape in satisfying a certain manipulation task. Second, it formulates that manipulation task as a set of constraints on the geometry of contact between the effector and the world. Third, it develops tools to transform those contact constraints into an effector shape for general 1 -DOF planar mechanisms and general 1 -DOF spatial mechanisms, and discusses the generalization to mechanisms with more than one degree of freedom. We describe the case studies of designing grippers with invariant grasp geometry, grippers with improved grasp stability, and grippers with extended grasp versatility. We further showcase the techniques with the design of the fingers of the MLab hand, a <b>three-fingered</b> <b>gripper</b> actuated with a single motor, capable of exerting any combination of geometricall...|$|E
40|$|The {{days when}} robots were only used {{to move their}} {{endpoint}} from point Ato B, passing through point C, safely hidden behind a fence, are over. Nowadays robots have to grasp objects, move them around, manipulate them using two arms, while keeping controlled distances from humans and fragile objects or even during physical interaction with humans. Furthermore, all these tasks have to be executed as optimally as possible. Six degrees-of-freedom industrial arms are being replaced by mobile platforms with two redundant arms, both equipped with force sensors, <b>three-fingered</b> <b>grippers</b> with touch sensors, a head with cameras, laser scanners, inertial sensors, etc. In the coming years the habitat of robotic systems will evolve from the industrial work cells to domestic, cluttered and populated environments. To cope with the increasing complexity, not only a highly modular methodology for motion specificationis needed. Also the online motion coordination becomes very important since it has {{to cope with the}} dynamically changing environment in which the robotic system works. This thesis presents a highly modular control hierarchy for the coordination of constraint-based motion specification that can be used with a high variety of sensors, robotic systems and tasks. To create a highly modular coordination system, a modular motion specification methodology needs to be used as the underlying framework. iTaSC, or instantaneous Task Specification using Constraints, is such a modular framework that allows us to specify motion by imposing those constraints on the interaction between the robot and the environment that are important for the task at hand. This thesisextends the iTaSC methodology to not only allow the specificationof constraints in feature spaces, which are built up from exactly six independent geometric coordinates, but to allow the specification of constraints in any feature space for which an interaction model can befound. Calculating the robot motion from the specified constraints can be very computationally expensive in systems that include a lot of actuated joints, such as humanoid robots. Therefore the quest for efficient algorithms is still ongoing. This thesis discusses one of the most ground-breaking algorithms for acceleration-based constrained hybrid (combination of forward and inverse) dynamics, and explains how it can be extended for tree-like kinematic robot structures and how {{it can be used to}} solve an iTaSC motion specification. Building software support for the new generation of robot applications from scratch for each new robotic system, or each new application is a very elaborate task. Therefore reusable software components and formal representations of both the robotic system and the task to be executed are mandatory. This thesis presents a component-based modular architecture for the next generation of robot controllers based on the extended iTaSC motion specification and coordination. A formal representation for robotic systems and their motion specificationis presented to facilitate the creation of interchangeable file formatsfor the specification of robot skills. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{gripping}} may {{be achieved}} through gripper design, automated part recognition, intelligent algorithm {{for control of the}} gripper, and on-line decision-making based on sensory data. A generic framework which integrates sensory data, part recognition, decision-making and gripper control to achieve intelligent gripping based on ABB industrial robot is constructed. The <b>three-fingered</b> <b>gripper</b> actuated by a linear servo actuator designed and developed in this project for precise speed and position control is capable of handling a large variety of objects. Generic algorithms for intelligent part recognition are developed. Edge vector representation is discussed. Object geometric features are extracted. Fuzzy logic is successfully utilized to enhance the intelligence of the system. The generic fuzzy logic algorithm, which may also find application in other fields, is presented. Model-based gripping planning algorithm which is capable of extracting object grasp features from its geometric features and reasoning out grasp model for objects with different geometry is proposed. Manipulator trajectory planning solves the problem of generating robot programs automatically. Object-oriented programming technique based on Visual C++ MFC is used to constitute the system software so as to ensure the compatibility, expandability and modular programming design. Hierarchical architecture for intelligent gripping is discussed, which partitions the robotâ€™s functionalities into high-level (modeling, recognizing, planning and perception) layers, and low-level (sensing, interfacing and execute) layers. Individual system modules are integrated seamlessly to constitute the intelligent gripping system...|$|E
