For this purpose actively cooled <b>target</b> <b>elements</b> with an internal coolant flow return, made of 2 -D CFC armor tiles brazed onto a two tube cooling structure were developed and manufactured at the Forschungszentrum Julich.

FEM-simulations of the thermal and mechanical behavior show that a detachment of about 25 % of the bonded area between the copper tubes and the PFA can be tolerated, without exceeding the critical heat flux at 15 MW/m(2) or a surface temperature of 1400 degreesC at 10 MW/m(2) by using twisted tape inserts with a twist ratio of 2 at a cooling water velocity of 10 m/s. Thermal cycling tests in an electron beam facility up to a power density level 10. 5 MW/m(2) show a very good behavior of parts of the <b>target</b> <b>elements,</b> which confirms the performance under fusion relevant conditions.

The concentrations of As, Cd and Pb in vegetables were 86. 7, 100 and 80. 0 %, respectively, over the permissible limits and possible contamination by Tl may also be of concern. Changes in soil microbial counts and average well colour development were also significantly different at different sampling distances from the smelter.
