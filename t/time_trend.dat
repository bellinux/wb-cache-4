25|$|Although the {{importance}} of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for {{a greater emphasis on}} working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy. Large surveys of working conditions, including conditions recognized as risk factors for job stress, were conducted in member states of the European Union in 1990, 1995, and 2000. Results showed a <b>time</b> <b>trend</b> suggesting an increase in work intensity. In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-quarter of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60% in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in 1990) in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.|$|E

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>trends</b> in incidence, {{causes of}} death, and {{prognosis}} of cancer of unknown primary (CUP) could provide important clues for occult primary sites and thus result in effective organ-specific treatment, although such studies are seldom reported. We aimed at examining <b>time</b> <b>trends</b> in percentage and incidence rates, causes of death, and survival of CUP. A total of 50 545 patients with CUP {{were identified in}} the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1960 to 2008. We used direct standardization to standardize age-adjusted incidence rate to the Segi world population. Consistent increase before the late 1990 s and dramatic decrease afterward was observed for both percentage and incidence of CUP in Swedes regardless of sex. Comparable <b>time</b> <b>trends</b> were noted in Norwegian and Finnish populations, but with several years earlier peaking times. For most anatomic sites, CUP and lung cancer were the two most common causes of death for patients with CUP irrespective of nodal involvement.

Adenocarcinoma accounted {{for most of this}} incidence variation and experienced the worst prognosis. High incidence rates and comparable <b>time</b> <b>trends</b> for CUP were observed in Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

Data on <b>time</b> <b>trends</b> in childhood cancer incidence from the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Italy were analysed using two different approaches: standard Poisson regression and a Bayesian regression approach including an autoregressive component. Our focus was on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), since this is hypothesised to have an infectious aetiology, but for purposes of comparison we also conducted similar analyses for selected other childhood cancer sites (acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AnLL), central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neuroblastoma (NB)). The two models fitted the data equally well, but led to different interpretations of the <b>time</b> <b>trends.</b> The first produced ever-increasing rates, while the latter produced non-monotonic patterns, particularly for ALL, which showed evidence of a cyclical pattern. The Bayesian analysis produced findings that are consistent with the hypothesis of an infectious aetiology for ALL, but not for AnLL or for solid tumours (CNS and NB). Although sudden changes in <b>time</b> <b>trends</b> should be interpreted with caution, the results of the Bayesian approach are consistent with current knowledge of the natural history of childhood ALL, including a short latency time and the postulated infectious aetiology of the disease...|$|R
