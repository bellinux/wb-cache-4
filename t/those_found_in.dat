5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 13thcentury, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders {{including}} the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders {{were responsible for}} the foundation of sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for <b>those</b> <b>founded</b> <b>in</b> this period to have concentric defences.|$|R

It is a feature found on many male hummingbirds, particularly <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect the throat.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially {{on the nature of}} reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about jiva and ajiva (self, matter) utilizes anekantavada.|$|E

Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E

Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the vaults of English cathedrals are low compared {{with many of}} <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> other countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E

5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, {{and as they}} have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly's kernel is a hybrid, {{containing}} {{features of}} both monolithic and microkernels, {{such as the}} message passing capability of microkernels enabling larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for certain critical tasks. The messaging subsystem being developed is similar to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly's messaging subsystem {{has the ability to}} act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly comparable to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> neutron stars – quark matter {{is expected to}} degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge {{would be able to}} pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> muscle.|$|E
