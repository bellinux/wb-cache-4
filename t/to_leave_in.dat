The Youth Cohort Study (YCS) is a major programme of longitudinal research designed to monitor the behaviour and decisions of representative samples of young people aged sixteen upwards as they {{make the transition from}} compulsory education to further or higher education, or to the labour market. It tries to identify and explain the factors which influence post- 16 transitions, for example, educational attainment, training opportunities, experiences at school. To date the YCS covers thirteen cohorts and over forty surveys. The first cohort was first surveyed in 1985 and the thirteenth in 2007. The questionnaires have been designed, over the years, to be broadly comparable, but external changes and shifts in policy interest have brought about changes - some minor, some fundamental. Cohorts One to Twelve cover England and Wales but a change to the methodology means that from Cohort Thirteen, data cover England only. For further details of the methodology and coverage, see the documentation. The UK Data Archive currently holds data for the cohorts listed below: Cohort One (SN 3093) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1983 - 84 Cohort Two (SN 3094) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1984 - 85 *Cohort Three (SN 3012) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1985 - 86 Cohort Four (SN 3107) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1987 - 88 Cohort Five (SN 3531) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1989 - 90 Cohort Six (SN 3532) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1990 - 91 Cohort Seven (SN 3533) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1992 - 93 Cohort Eight (SN 3805) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1995 - 96 Cohort Nine (SN 4009) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1996 - 97 Cohort Ten (SN 4571) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 1998 - 99 Cohort Eleven (SN 5452) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 2000 - 01 Cohort Twelve (SN 5830) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 2002 - 03 Cohort Thirteen (SN 6024) surveyed those eligible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> school <b>in</b> 2005 - 06 *Some teaching materials using the data from Cohort Three have been developed.

5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the monastery}} during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted the buildings and used them as barracks. The monks were forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E

Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's naval {{campaign}} formed two phases. The first involved the Royalist fleet sailing from Kinsale in Ireland to Lisbon in Portugal. He took three large ships, , the Convertine and the Swallow, accompanied by four smaller vessels. Rupert sailed to Lisbon taking several prizes on route, {{where he received}} a warm welcome from King John IV, the ruler of recently independent Portugal, who was a supporter of Charles II. Blake arrived shortly afterwards with a Parliamentary fleet, and an armed stand-off ensued. Tensions rose, skirmishes began to break out and King John became increasingly keen for his Royalist guests <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>In</b> October 1650, Rupert's fleet, now comprising six vessels, broke out and headed into the Mediterranean. Still pursued by Blake, the Royalist fleet manoeuvred up the Spanish coast, steadily losing vessels to their pursuers.|$|E

After staying past his initial ten-day reservation, {{he was asked}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> December so that the resort could accommodate the high rollers who were expected for New Year's Eve. Instead of leaving, Hughes started negotiations to buy the Desert Inn. On March 27, 1967, Hughes purchased the resort from Dalitz for $6.2 {{million in cash and}} $7 million in loans. This was the first of many Las Vegas resort purchases by Hughes, including the Sands Hotel and Casino ($14.6 million) and the Frontier Hotel and Casino ($23 million). However, Hughes refused to include the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions in the deal, so Dalitz moved the tournament to his Stardust Resort and Casino in 1967 and 1968.|$|E

5|$|But {{during this}} period Japan's Navy Air Service was {{launching}} frequent air raids on the city, eventually totaling 50 raids according to the Navy's own records. The Navy Air Service had struck Nanking {{for the first time}} on August 15, and after winning air supremacy over the city on September 19 it began bombing the city night and day with impunity, hitting both military and civilian targets. In the face of Japanese bombs and the ongoing advance of the Japanese Army, the large majority of Nanking's citizens fled the city. By early December Nanking's population had dropped from its former total of more than one million to less than 500,000, a figure which included Chinese refugees from rural villages burned down by their own government's scorched earth policies. Most of those still in the city were very poor and had nowhere else to go. Foreign residents of Nanking were also repeatedly asked to leave the city which was becoming more and more chaotic under the strain of bombings, fires, looting by criminals, and electrical outages, but those few foreigners brave enough to stay behind strived to find a way to help the Chinese civilians who had been unable <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>In</b> late-November a group of them led by German citizen John Rabe established the Nanking Safety Zone in the center of the city, a self-proclaimed demilitarized zone where civilian refugees could congregate in order to hopefully escape the fighting. The safety zone was recognized by the Chinese government, and on December 8 Tang Shengzhi demanded that all civilians evacuate there.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, the {{battalion}} returned to Australia for rest and re-organisation, sailing on the transport Clip Fontain. Although the Australian Army had been heavily committed to combat {{operations in the}} Pacific {{in the early years}} of the war against Japan, by 1944 the United States military had assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the Pacific and this had resulted in uncertainty about the role of the Australian Army in future operations. As a result, a long period of training followed, and there was a significant turn over of personnel within the 9th Division as many men were discharged due to medical reasons or transferred to other units and young replacements were brought in. After concentrating at Ravenshoe in May 1944, {{the battalion}} was rebuilt, focusing on individual training and then collective training up to battalion level. After this, in September 1944, the battalion moved to Trinity Beach, close to Cairns, where amphibious training was conducted. Further training continued throughout October and November 1944. At the end of the year, the tempo dropped off and the battalion's personnel were occupied with sporting activities prior <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> February and March 1945. Finally, in early May 1945, the battalion moved to Townsville where it boarded the transport David C. Shanks, bound for Morotai Island.|$|E
