5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed around <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not get a {{line from}} the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties {{of one sort or another}} and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts {{that had to do with}} really big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008. Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News, [...] "I {{thought it would}} be funny <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get [...] to read very, very dense historical documents centering around the second World War, [...] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self-analysis, which I thought was funny." [...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fimber Bravo and Charles Hayward {{were asked}} to {{collaborate}} on the album and Taylor said they immediately created unexpected material. Taylor described Hayward as [...] "very capable of coming up with his own stuff" [...] and stated that {{he was responsible for}} the drumming in the background of the final chorus of [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love", which Taylor labelled as [...] "explosive". He stated that it was not something the band would have thought to do and that it worked [...] "tremendously well". The recordings Hayward did only lasted for a few hours and Taylor stated, [...] "we were kind of just left to our own devices <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make use of it". Bravo wanted to use the steel pans, featured in the title track [...] "One Life Stand", [...] "in a way that [...] not really known for".|$|E
2500|$|Frey {{came up with}} a {{cinematic}} {{scenario of}} a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered [...] "a weird world peopled by freaky characters", and became [...] "quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape." [...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie." [...] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage [...] "just one shot to the next ... a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people." [...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E
6000|$|... “On our train. We {{walked through}} the cars at Melton, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> knew anybody aboard, {{and there were the}} pair in the smoker, smoking cigarettes, as big as life.” ...|$|R
60|$|Which does it. Off they go down-stream, still huddling and {{shrinking}} like {{boats that}} are taking sails in, and peeping <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are coming. Yes, my dears, we are coming.|$|R
30|$|For that, {{we should}} care to better define and delimit {{the concept of}} “smartness”. For that, let us again return to the {{question}} of definitions, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can make some progress there.|$|R
6000|$|AMY, {{feeling that}} Ginevra is very young, 'Need you ask? Oh, Ginevra, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find a happy ending. It was mother's idea.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That blamed Allinson {{corner post}} shoves us back, and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> squeeze in a block beside them {{and keep on}} the ore, though I guess there's not much use in it. If I was a jumper, I'd shift that stake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{perfectly}} willing {{to keep out of}} it if you say so, Waltham," [...] broke in Tom. [...] "We came down here merely <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> help you in any way. But I see your front axle is broken, and you will have to get the garage people to help you out with that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, halloa-halloa!" [...] he said, affably, [...] "We {{were just}} glancing through your spare scenery <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> couldn't find {{something}} for my pal here. This is Mr. Brewster, my father-in-law, old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! Heffy lurchin' {{into the}} form-rooms like a frowzy old retriever, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> aren't up <b>to</b> something. You know he never leaves his house alone, these days," [...] said McTurk. [...] "Oh, {{it will be}} giddy!" ...|$|R
60|$|Let us {{review the}} matter calmly and judicially, not condemning James off-hand, but rather probing {{the whole affair}} to its core, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can confirm my view that it is {{possible}} to find excuses for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was eleven-ten, sir," [...] the chauffeur declared. [...] "Mr. Quest and I both {{took out}} our watches <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make New York by mid-day. Then {{one of those}} fellows hit me over the head and I've been laid up ever since. A man who keeps a store a little way along the road picked me up and looked after me." ...|$|E
60|$|Here we took up our station, {{cruising}} off and on, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{meet any}} ships going to or {{coming from the}} Buenos Ayres or the Rio de la Plata; but we met with nothing worth notice. However, we employed ourselves in things necessary for our going off to sea; for we filled all our water-casks, and got some fish for our present use, to spare {{as much as possible}} our ship's stores.|$|E
60|$|We thought our voyaging {{was at a}} {{full stop}} now; but three of us, {{with a couple of}} our negroes, {{mounting}} the hills another way, to view the course of the river, we found a fair channel again after about half a mile's march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on shore, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> carry them.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{know how}} to handle one. Phil has been {{painting}} a big door to represent a black bear, and <b>we</b> are going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do as well with a revolver as we did with the rifle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; but {{she never}} knows. And oh, Beranger, Narcisse told me--ah, was it to tease me?--that Diane has told them all they wanted to know, for that they sent her here on purpose <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were not all Huguenots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly he did," [...] said Mrs Storekeeper. [...] "He rode {{through here}} yesterday, {{and he stopped}} at the store <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had any of that Lynchburg tobacco he used to smoke when he lived here. He's gone on to his aunt's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you. This evening after the assault I chanced {{to walk with}} some of my fellows, round yonder small fort upon the knoll <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> spy a weak spot in it. Some of them came to the wall to curse us, and among them whom should I see but a big man with a white face, red hair {{and a touch of}} Anthony's fire upon his cheek? What make you of that, Squire Nigel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so sorry! Does it {{feel very}} painful? You can't think how {{constantly}} I've {{been thinking of}} you since the accident; for it was all my fault. If I hadn't jumped up in such a passion, the pony wouldn't have run away, and you wouldn't have been hurt. I'm so very, very sorry, and I got dear papa to bring me {{here to tell you}} so, and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do anything to make you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Rollo, [...] "a wallet, {{or a small}} pocket-book. I suppose now, that {{it would}} have been better to have put it in some other pocket; because that was pretty full. So in that, I suppose, I did wrong. Then James and I came home, only we did not walk along directly; we played about a little from one side of the road to the other, and then we went under the great hemlock-tree, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not find another hemlock-seed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm jest a runnin' {{over our}} business, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{can take up}} this yer handily. Loker," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "we must set Adams and Springer on the track of these yer; they've been booked some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind those hotels now!" [...] cried Dave, as {{he slipped}} off one shoe after another. [...] "It's get to bed now {{and an early}} start in the morning <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't catch Blower, Haskers, and--Morr!" [...] and he grinned.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that the}} case appears to be merely one of {{malicious}} damage. But none the less, I should be very glad to go carefully round the premises, and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can find any trace to show us who your visitor may have been." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, as we {{neared the}} shore, Jack and I {{said we would}} go {{a little out of}} our way <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> procure one of those ducks; so, {{directing}} Peterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated, promising to rejoin him speedily. But we did not find the ducks, although we made a diligent search for half-an-hour. We were about to retrace our steps when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights that we had yet beheld.|$|E
6000|$|There were a {{good many}} vessels, {{but most of them}} were big ones. We could hardly have the impudence to ask a great three-masted ship, under full sail, to stop and give us a lift to New York. At any rate, we {{had nothing to do with}} the asking. The captain would attend to that. But every time we came near a vessel going the other way, we looked about <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see {{anything}} of an officer with a trumpet, standing all ready to sing out, [...] "Sail ho!" ...|$|E
60|$|This morning Miss ------, {{the celebrated}} astronomical lady, called. She {{had brought a}} letter of {{introduction}} to me, while consul; and her purpose now was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take her {{as one of our}} party to Rome, whither she likewise is bound. We readily consented, for she seems to be a simple, strong, healthy-humored woman, who will not fling herself as a burden on our shoulders; and my only wonder is that a person evidently so {{able to take care of}} herself should wish to have an escort.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{probable}} that after the lesson they got the other night they did not come so near, and that they merely shot their arrows <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were still on guard. However, we may as well stay here for a bit <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anything comes of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Anchor {{practice}} {{improvement in}} discipline inquiry: Plan-do-study-act cycles {{are used to}} study improvement efforts while engaging in remediation of problems.

6000|$|... "Come to my room, Joyce. I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> cannot {{find a more}} {{becoming}} way of arranging your hair. It {{has grown}} so thick and long.
