5|$|NY240 {{was first}} {{designated}} in the renumbering of state highways in New York in 1930 from NY39 in Springville to NY18 near downtown Buffalo. The portion between Springville and Ashford was {{a section of}} NY62 and Harlem Road was unnumbered. The section south of CR16 in West Valley was a portion of NY242. NY240 instead used Abbott Road and South Park Avenue to get <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> which got extended to NY5 in the 1930s. NY240 was realigned south to Ellicottville in the mid-1960s, after numerous bypasses and realignments had been done by the State of New York Department of Public Works. NY240 was realigned onto Harlem Road c. 1962. The former alignment <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo</b> is now designated as NY950M, a reference route.|$|E

Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste.

5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo</b> into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo</b> and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city was on a slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities.|$|E
50|$|Petrosino {{warned the}} Secret Service, but McKinley ignored the warning, even after Roosevelt, who had {{by this time}} become Vice-President of the United States, vouched for Petrosino's abilities.

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route14, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route14 south of Pittsford was routed {{on what is}} now NY64; however, {{in the vicinity of}} Bloomfield, Route14 broke from modern NY64 and used what later became NY20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY64 that overlaps with US20 and NY5 was included in Route6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo.</b> On March1, 1921, Route14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south on what is now NY64.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{following}} {{what other}} states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo</b> {{portion of the}} Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2017, Latos {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Toronto Blue Jays.

Latos started three games for the Blue Jays, pitching to a 6.60 ERA and 1.80 WHIP. The Blue Jays designated Latos for assignment on May 5, and outrighted him back <b>to</b> <b>Buffalo</b> on May 8. He was released by the team on May 30.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed <b>to,</b> <b>Buffalo</b> marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, {{head of the}} La Pointe delegation. Although Buffalo and the other Lake Superior chiefs signed, they {{were said to be}} relatively silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance of the terms of the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La Pointe, later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E
