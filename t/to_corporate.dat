40|$|Purpose – The paper {{examines}} {{case law}} and statutory provisions related <b>to</b> lifting the <b>corporate</b> veil. The {{aim of the}} paper is to explore recent case law {{in order to determine}} whether courts have moved away from an overly restrictive approach when dealing with cases relating <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> personality. <b>To</b> offer a full account of the exceptions <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> personality doctrine, this paper also examines cases where the veil of incorporation is lifted due to a breach of a statutory provision. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews recent case law and statutory provisions relating <b>to</b> lifting the <b>corporate</b> veil. The paper critically reviews the exceptions <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> personality doctrine which amount <b>to</b> lifting the <b>corporate</b> veil. Findings – The paper finds that courts are more willing <b>to</b> lift the <b>corporate</b> veil compared <b>to</b> before. They have moved away from the restrictive approach and this is demonstrated by the tendency to find new exceptions <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> personality doctrine such as the interests of justice argument or lifting the veil in tort cases. Originality/value – The paper offers an up-to-date assessment of the exceptions <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> personality doctrine and highlights the growing tendency to finding new ways of lifting the corporate veil...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the suitability for Business Excellence Models (BEMs) <b>to</b> include <b>Corporate</b> Sustainability on business model criteria. The conceptual paper brings {{discussion of what}} sort of measures are required to fit organizations' needs in measuring performance in terms of economic, social, and environment bottom-lines. A literature review has been conducted for BEMs that includes the EFQM Excellence Model, Baldrige Model, ISO standards, GRI, and explores its integration with Corporate Sustainability. Then, an analysis is deployed {{in order to identify}} common frameworks and metrics used for assessing sustainability in the three dimensions of bottom-lines. Despite there are better frameworks <b>to</b> assess <b>corporate</b> sustainability, Business Excellence Models (BEMs) were found to be suitable performance measurement frameworks <b>to</b> integrate <b>Corporate</b> Sustainability; however, business criteria remain unclear and ambiguous, not addressing clearly how <b>to</b> measure <b>Corporate</b> Sustainability Performance. The research provides a general approach to explore suitability of BEMs <b>to</b> include <b>corporate</b> sustainability and it is limited in scope as some organizations' have specific maturity levels in both: deploying BEMs and corporate sustainability. Further research include the suitability of current economic systems <b>to</b> reach <b>corporate</b> sustainability, and the use of lean-six sigma methods <b>to</b> support <b>corporate</b> sustainability at strategic and operational levels...|$|R

Mitsubishi decided to target sales <b>to</b> <b>corporate</b> customers in Japan at first to allow local governments and businesses to set up recharging stations around the country. The company said initial sales were constrained by production capacity but expects production to ramp up quickly from 2,000 units in 2009/10 to 30,000 vehicles within three years as it expands {{production of}} lithium-ion battery through Lithium Energy Japan, {{a joint venture with}} GS Yuasa Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation.

5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing <b>to</b> <b>corporate</b> customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
