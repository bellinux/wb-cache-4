Judge Adams {{indicated}} that he would accept a supersedeas bond of $5,000, and Burton was not sentenced. Burton became the first defendant ever convicted under § 1782, more than 40 years after its enactment.|$|E
5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had had {{ample opportunity to}} form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} avoid {{introducing}} the conviction {{for the murder of}} Anthony Smith worked against Silcott too. It meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> could not be told that he had signed on for his bail at Tottenham police station at around 7 pm on the evening of Blakelock's death. This was when witnesses had placed Silcott at a Broadwater Youth Association meeting, making inflammatory speeches against the police.|$|E

On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing.

5|$|The case of Gruban v Booth {{opened on}} 7 May 1917 in the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice {{in front of}} Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington {{represented}} Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth's cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E

5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
25|$|Respondent {{was convicted}} of storing {{hazardous}} liquid mercury without a permit, “on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004,” {{in violation of the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.). The jury was not asked to determine the exact duration of the violation. In sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, calculated by assessing the $50,000 maximum daily fine for each of the 762 days between September 19, 2002 and October 19, 2004. Respondent appealed on the basis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that Apprendi did not apply to criminal fines.|$|E
25|$|Attorneys Samuel Leibowitz, Walter H. Pollak and Osmond Frankel {{argued the}} case from February 15 to 18, 1935.

50|$|Wood's appeal hearing {{commenced}} on 22 August 2011 in the Criminal Court of Appeal before Chief Judge at Common Law Peter McClellan, Justice Megan Latham, and Justice Stephen Rothman. Wood's barrister Tim Game SC submitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> {{verdict was}} unreasonable and {{not supported by}} the evidence. His submission spoke of nine grounds for appeal. One was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trial miscarried by reason of the prejudice occasioned by the Tedeschi's closing address. Others related to criticisms of Barr's directions to <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2000, the Court heard Carter v. United States, {{on appeal}} from an {{unpublished}} {{decision of the}} Third Circuit.

5000|$|The Court had {{previously}} {{held that a}} jury of 12 is not essential to the right. It additionally held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> verdict need not be unanimous.

25|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{had found}} that two {{aggravating}} factors applied to Coker's crime (his prior convictions {{and the fact that}} the rape was committed during the course of a robbery) did not change the Court's conclusion. The rape may have been committed during the course of another crime and by a hardened criminal, but the rape did not escalate into a killing. Finally, even a deliberate killing does not merit a death sentence under Georgia law without the finding of aggravating factors.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} {{following}} his incarceration, Collins refused to grant interviews to the media; but {{six years after}} his conviction, Collins formally requested a personal interview with reporters from The Ann Arbor News. In this interview, Collins vehemently denied his guilt {{in any of the}} Michigan Murders. He asserted that key evidence attesting to his innocence had been suppressed by the prosecution team at his 1970 trial, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had been biased, and the scientific testimony related to blood and hair comparisons had been invalid.|$|E
25|$|Deck and his {{attorneys}} also argued about {{the burden of}} proof. Deck’s counsel believed that the bias created by the shackles put {{the burden of proof}} on Deck and not the state. The defense argued that the state could not prove that the shackles did no harm. Ultimately, the defense felt that the shackling of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning shackling made a difference in the decision <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> made. The defense argued that this alone was a violation against the constitution and due process.|$|E
50|$|The Criminal Court of Appeal {{delivered}} {{their opinion}} on 24 February 2012 acquitting Wood of Byrne's murder and ordering {{his release from}} jail.

They dismissed the Crown evidence as being critically flawed and ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> possibility of her suicide ought not have been excluded.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the idea}} of people's juries has been hailed as being of great benefit in a democracy, {{it has also been}} pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> vote {{is not likely to be}} {{representative}} of the views of the population in general.
