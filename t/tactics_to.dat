5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|Clayton used various <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> pay for {{the needed}} {{infrastructure}} changes in the state. Most of the South was {{in desperate need of}} infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in this respect. He raised taxes, tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and flooded the state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and drove up the state debt.|$|E

5|$|In the {{two major}} land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly {{adjusted}} their <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and by staying on high ground at Plataea. At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options. At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, {{which resulted in the}} Persian defeat. The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites, with disastrous results. It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco-Persian wars. However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat.|$|E
5|$|Khalid bin Ali, the Al Khawalid ancestor, was the {{governor}} of Riffa and ruled over Sitra and Nabih Saleh islands, and his elder son Ibrahim controlled Jabalah Habashi. The Khalids were known for being hard on the Shia. In 1923, the events took a new turn. Wanting to end the calls for reform, the Khalids and Al Dawasir tribe used armed <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> intimidate reform supporters. The former's paramilitary forces numbered 100, about 20 {{percent of the total}} Al Khalifa manpower, while the latter had about 400 men.|$|E

The German Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, Army Group South took control of Ukraine, and Army Group Center advanced towards Moscow.

5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders {{ignored the}} command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge {{the death of}} his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and {{slaughtered}} 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths. Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories.|$|E

Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E

5|$|During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had {{to adapt}} his {{artillery}} <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> trench warfare, including experimentation with {{various types of}} mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before {{he was able to}} act on this, on June 30, 1864, he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on medical leave to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise, although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee's army in the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E

The workshops were mainly attended by students from Fisk University, Tennessee A (later Tennessee State University), American Baptist Theological Seminary (later American Baptist College), and Meharry Medical College. Among those attending Lawson's sessions were students who would become significant leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, among them: Marion Barry, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, Diane Nash, and C.
