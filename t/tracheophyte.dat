5000|$|The {{stems of}} Aglaophyton were round in cross-section, smooth, unornamented, {{and up to}} about 6mm in diameter. Kidston and Lang {{interpreted}} the plant as growing upright, to about 50 cm in height, but Edwards has re-interpreted it as having prostrate habit, with shorter aerial axes of about 15 cm height. The axes branched dichotomously, the aerial axes branching at a comparatively wide angle of up to 90Â°, and were terminated with elliptical, thick-walled sporangia, which when mature, opened by spiral slits, so that the sporangia appear to be spiral in form. Sporangia contained many identical spores (isospores) bearing trilete marks. The spores may therefore be interpreted as meiospores, the product of meiotic divisions, and thus the plants described by Edwards and by Kidston and Lang were diploid, sporophytes. The plant was originally interpreted as a <b>tracheophyte,</b> because the stem has a simple central vascular cylinder or protostele, but more recent interpretations {{in the light of}} additional data indicated that Rhynia major had water-conducting tissue lacking the secondary thickening bars seen in the xylem of Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii, more like the water-conducting system (hydrome) of moss sporophytes.

Sensitive sequence com-parisons showed these two tRNAs as well as trnN(guu) and trnS(gcu) to be very similar to their respective counterparts in chlamydial bacteria. We identified homologs of these chlamydial-type tRNAs also in other lycophyte, fern, and gymno-sperm DNAs, suggesting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) into mitochondria in the early vascular plant stem lineages. These findings extend plant mitochondrial HGT to affect individual tRNA genes, to include bacterial donors, and suggest that Chlamydiae on top of their recently proposed key role in primary chloroplast establishment may also have partic-ipated in early <b>tracheophyte</b> genome evolution...|$|E
40|$|Late Silurian {{greening}} of {{the land}} has been inferred from a rising diversity of fossil plant fragments (Edwards et al. 2014) and increased frequency of lateral accretion sets of meandering streams (Davies et al. 2011), but direct evidence comes from rooting struc-tures and soil productivity inferred from palaeosols (Driese et al. 2000; Hillier et al. 2008; Brasier et al. 2014).

However, studies on evolution of different biochemical variants of C 4 photosynthesis are limited to <b>tracheophytes</b> and origins of C 4 -cycle genes are not clear till now. Our comprehensive analyses on bioinformatics and phylogenetics of novel transcriptomic sequencing data of 21 rhodophytes and 19 Phaeophyceae marine species and public genomic data of more algae, <b>tracheophytes,</b> cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and archaea revealed the origin and evolution of C 4 cycle-related genes.

Notably, cyanobacteria may not possess complete C 4 pathway because of the flawed annotation of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) genes in public data. Most C 4 cycle-related genes endured duplication and gave rise to functional differentiation and adaptation in different algal lineages.

Dichotomizing sterile forms are assigned to Hostinella sp. and scarce stems terminated in spherical structures are interpreted as indetermined sporangia. The palynological association 1 recovered from this level contains abundant phytodebris, trilete spores, few cryptospores, algae, very poorly preserved chitinozoans, and other elements (fungi, ?lichens). Trilete spores assignable to Apiculiretusispora sp., Punctatisporites sp. and Retusotriletes sp., are obtained from the maceration of some isolated sporangia. The dichotomous branching of the stems and the trilete spores recovered from the isolated sporangia support its <b>tracheophyte</b> affinity. The palynological assemblage 2, obtained three metres above, contains abundant phytodebris and more diverse palynomorphs. Two new species (Retusotriletes albarinii n. sp., Acinosporites macgregorii n. sp.) are described.

40|$|Riboflavin {{serves as}} a {{precursor}} for flavocoenzymes (FMN and FAD) and is essential for all living organisms. The two committed enzymatic steps of riboflavin biosynthesis are performed in plants by bifunctional RIBA enzymes comprised of GTP cyclohydrolase II (GCHII) and 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -butanone- 4 -phosphate synthase (DHBPS). Angiosperms share a small RIBA gene family consisting of three members. A reduction of AtRIBA 1 expression in the Arabidopsis rfd 1 mutant and in RIBA 1 antisense lines is not complemented by the simultaneously expressed isoforms AtRIBA 2 and AtRIBA 3. The intensity of the bleaching leaf phenotype of RIBA 1 deficient plants correlates with the inactivation of AtRIBA 1 expression, while no significant effects on the mRNA abundance of AtRIBA 2 and AtRIBA 3 were observed. We examined reasons why both isoforms fail to sufficiently compensate {{for a lack of}} RIBA 1 expression. All three RIBA isoforms are shown to be translocated into chloroplasts as GFP fusion proteins. Interestingly, both AtRIBA 2 and AtRIBA 3 have amino acid exchanges in conserved peptides domains that {{have been found to be}} essential for the two enzymatic functions. In vitro activity assays of GCHII and DHBPS with all of the three purified recombinant AtRIBA proteins and complementation of E. coli ribA and ribB mutants lacking DHBPS and GCHII expression, respectively, confirmed the loss of bifunctionality for AtRIBA 2 and AtRIBA 3.

We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate the organelles, rolling circle amplification (RCA) to amplify the genome, and shotgun sequencing to 8 x depth coverage to obtain the complete chloroplast genome sequence. The genome is 154, 373 bp, containing inverted repeats of 15, 314 bp each, a large single-copy region of 104, 088 bp, and a small single-copy region of 19, 657 bp. Gene order is more {{similar to those of}} mosses, liverworts, and hornworts than to gene order for other vascular plants. For example, the Huperzia chloroplast genome possesses the bryophyte gene order for a previously characterized 30 kb inversion, thus supporting the hypothesis that lycophytes are sister to all other extant vascular plants. The lycophyte chloroplast genome data also enable a better reconstruction of the basal <b>tracheophyte</b> genome, which is useful for inferring relationships among bryophyte lineages. Several unique characters are observed in Huperzia, such as movement of the gene ndhF from the small single copy region into the inverted repeat. We present several analyses of evolutionary relationships among land plants by using nucleotide data, inferred amino acid sequences, and by comparing gene arrangements from chloroplast genomes. The results, while still tentative pending the large number of chloroplast genomes from other key lineages that are soon to be sequenced, are intriguing in themselves, and contribute to a growing comparative database of genomic and morphological data across the green plants...|$|E

Mosses are an understudied {{group of}} plants that can {{potentially}} confirm or expand principles of plant function described for <b>tracheophytes,</b> from which they diverge strongly in structure. Resaerch was undertaken to assess whether mosses follow patterns already observed in vascular plants such as optimization of performance by modification of functional "clusters" of trait-trait and trait-environment correlations, increase of tissue Î´ 13 C associated with greater microhabitat irradiance and altitude, and nutrient content and stoichiometry associated with soil fertiliy and other environmental gradients. A total of 40 physiological and morphological traits were measured from 17 ground-, trunk-and branch-dwelling Hawaiian moss species and one liverwort species to test the hypotheses that 1) trait values would reflect the distinctive growth form and slow growth of mosses, but also that trait correlations would be analogous to those of <b>tracheophytes,</b> 2) moss carbon isotope ratios would correlate with irradiance and elevation, and 3) moss nutrient concentrations would follow stoichiometric patterns found in vascular plants. The moss species had low leaf mass per area (LMA) and low gas exchange rates, but unlike <b>tracheophytes,</b> light-saturated photosynthetic rate per mass (Amass) did not correlate with habitat irradiance. Other photosynthetic parameters and structural traits were aligned with microhabitat irradiance, driving inter-correlation of traits including leaf area, cell size, cell wall thickness, and canopy density. Across species, Amass and nitrogen concentration correlated negatively with canopy mass per area (CMA), analogous to linkages found for the "leaf economic spectrum," with CMA replacing LMA. Bryophytes were remarkably similar to vascular plants in exhibiting greater Î´ 13 C with increasing elevation and microhabitiat irradiance. Results supported stoichiometric theory: mass-based nutrient concentrations increased with nutrient availability; area-based nutrient concentrations increased with irradiance as mediated by bryophyte canopy mass per area; N and P followed the general scaling shown previously for tracheophytes; and P increased and N:P decreased with elevation consistent with increasing cold tolerance. These findings extend the generality of stoichiometric theory, pointing to convergent physiological responses across distantly related lineages, operating across local and global resource gradients.
