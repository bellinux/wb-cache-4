5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
5|$|The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega {{planned to}} release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> less than US$200. Sega {{cancelled}} the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears {{that it would}} dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced {{too close to the}} Saturn to be a viable competitor. Electronic Gaming Monthly used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools' Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} {{at some length}} by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> less than {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin's reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.|$|E
5|$|Football resumed {{after the}} war for the 1919–20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup {{at the end of}} season, beating Huddersfield Town 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus {{becoming}} the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923–24, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings. In 1927, they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, they bought {{in one of the most}} prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £4,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals.|$|E
5|$|Tekken series {{producer}} Katsuhiro Harada teased {{an announcement}} on his Twitter feed on September 17, 2010 ("TGS Sep 18(Sat) at Tougeki Booth. I'll announce something :D"). It was rumored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> related to Tekken X Street Fighter or Tekken 7. The game was announced to be Tekken Tag Tournament 2, sequel to Tekken Tag Tournament, on September 18, 2010 at the Tougeki event as promised. Producer Katsuhiro Harada {{stated that the}} game engine would {{be different from the}} one used in Tekken 6. The release of the arcade version of the game in Japan was originally planned for summer 2011, but due to complications derived from the Great East Japan earthquake, the arcade release was postponed until Autumn 2011. At the World Cyber Games 2010, Harada stated that the console version would feature additional console-exclusive returning characters and bonus gameplay modes. He also suggested that the release of the console version of the game would take place between the releases of Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.|$|E

As he couldn't afford new agricultural implements for his machine, he was forced to innovate, welding together two harrows designed for use by horses and similarly trying to adapt other horse-drawn gear for use in mechanized agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Browne {{began to}} develop her belief system while at the college, experimenting with her lover and taking in the lectures of Morley College from her post there. She {{wrote a letter to}} H. G.

25|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the 2005 movie, Majesco Entertainment and developer Terminal Reality released a video game adaptation on Xbox and PlayStation 2. While primarily based on the film, elements from both the movie and the television series are included, as the game sets out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of a canonical link between the two—although the Æon character in the game is modeled only after Theron and is also voiced by her.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Elbe's last surgery, her case was already a {{sensation}} in newspapers of Denmark and Germany. A Danish court invalidated the couple's marriage in October 1930, and Elbe managed to get her sex and name legally changed, including receiving a passport as Lili Ilse Elvenes. She stopped painting, believing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{that was part of}} the identity of Einar. After the dissolution of their marriage, Elbe returned to Dresden for her fourth surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, a {{group of}} {{businessmen}} led by Joe Claudio formed the Perth Kangaroos IFC. The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs. At the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. It turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of a farce. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated and easily won the Singapore league title. However, with dwindling support and resources, the experiment {{proved to be a}} financial disaster and Perth Kangaroos IFC soon folded.|$|E

To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which {{in addition to his}} Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5million in total or $6.5million per year.|$|E
