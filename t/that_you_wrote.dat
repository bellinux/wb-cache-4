Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] But there's nothing I can do about it.

2500|$|Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, {{an event}} which {{signaled}} {{the start of}} relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as [...] "writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism". At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu [...] "played along", transforming himself from a [...] "not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue" [...] into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was [...] "joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always knew, just like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant he was (or appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines". During a 2004 interview, reflecting {{on the value of}} literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: [...] "Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, how was it possible <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> so badly in the years of dogmatism?'. 'Forget that, dear—he would say—the problem is that I couldn't tell I was writing badly'." ...|$|E
