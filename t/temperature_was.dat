5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E

5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift.

5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs.

5|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared with today. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North America. In eastern Beringia from 35,000 YBP the northern Arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5°C (2.7°F) warmer than today, but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2°C (3.5°F) cooler.

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> clearly needed.|$|E

5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The <b>temperature</b> <b>was</b> now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles.
