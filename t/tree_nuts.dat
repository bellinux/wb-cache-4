Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> also provide additional protein.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} compositions, antioxidant {{activities and}} oxidative stabilities of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils were examined. The oils of almonds, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts were extracted using two solvent extraction systems, namely hexane and chloroform/methanol. The chloroform/methanol system resulted in higher oil yield for each <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> type examined. Pine nuts {{had the highest}} oil content while almonds had the lowest. The lipid class compositions of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils were analysed using thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detection and showed that triacylglycerols were the predominant lipid class present. Smaller amounts of sterols, sterol esters, phospholipids and sphingolipids were also present. The fatty acid compositions of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils were analysed using gas chromatography, showing that oleic acid is the predominant fatty acid in all samples except pine nut and walnut oils, which contained high amounts of linoleic acid. The sterol and stanol content and compositions were analysed using gas chromatography; β-sitosterol was the predominant sterol compound present in all samples, with lower amounts of campesterol, stigmasterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, 22 -nordehydrocholesterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol, cholesterol, cholestanol and β­sitostanol also present. The tocopherol compositions were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography, showing that α- and γ-tocopherols are the predominant tocopherol isomers present; however δ- and β-tocopherols were also detected in some samples. [...] The antioxidative components of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils were extracted using a solvent stripping process. The minor component stripped oils that remained after the solvent stripping process were analysed for their chemical compositions as described above, and were also used in the oxidative stability studies. The lipid composition of the <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oil extracts showed that they contained phospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols and tocopherols. The total phenolics contents of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oil extracts were analysed and showed that chloroform/methanol extracted oils had higher amounts of phenolic compounds than their hexane extracted counterparts. The antioxidant activity of <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oil minor component extracts were assessed using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity, β-carotene bleaching test, oxygen radical absorbance capacity and photochemiluminescence inhibition assay; results of these studies showed that extracts of chloroform/methanol extracted oils possessed higher antioxidant activities than extracts of their hexane extracted counterparts, while the extract of chloroform/methanol extracted pecan oil possessed the highest antioxidant activity. [...] The oxidative stability of non-stripped and stripped <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils were examined under two conditions, namely accelerated autoxidation and photooxidation. Progression of oxidation was monitored using tests for conjugated dienes, peroxide value, para-anisidine value and headspace volatile analysis. Primary products of oxidation persisted in the earlier stages of oxidation while secondary product levels increased dramatically during the latter stages of oxidation. Hexanal was the major headspace aldehyde formed in all oxidized samples except walnut oil, which contained primarily propanal. Results showed that chloroform/methanol extracted oils were more stable than hexane extracted oils in both the accelerated autoxidation and photooxidation studies. Oils of pecan and pistachio were the most stable while oils of pine nut and walnut were the least stable...|$|R

25|$|Common foods {{involved}} include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> soy, wheat, rice, and fruit. The common allergies {{vary depending}} on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem. This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.|$|E
25|$|The native {{habitat of}} Aspergillus is in soil, {{decaying}} vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration, but it invades {{all types of}} organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth.

25|$|Aflatoxins are {{poisonous}} carcinogens {{that are}} produced by certain molds (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sesame seeds, sorghum, sunflower seeds, <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices. When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is suspected in the findings of high percentages of samples of aflatoxin contaminated chicken meat and eggs in Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|The La Pérouse's {{expedition}} {{was last}} seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in New Holland, Australia. It had been observed by ships of the First Fleet of convicts from England {{under the command of}} Arthur Phillip who was just leaving for Port Jackson after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement. In 1791 France’s National Assembly decided to send out a search mission led by Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. With Thouin’s recommendation Delahaye, who was at this time principal assistant gardener at the botany school of the Jardin du Roi, was invited to join the expedition's team of [...] "savants" [...] (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as “ ... strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi.” Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the Louis d'or), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment. As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus and to read and write in French. His reading included Pierre Bulliard’s Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique (1783) and the works of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700–1782) who published works on forestry, naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds. Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> one containing gardening tools and another gardener’s clothing.|$|E

40|$|Peanut and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergies {{have become}} a public health problem over the last 2 decades. The {{diagnostic}} procedure relies on a suggestive history, {{as well as on}} evidence of sensitization (skin prick testing and/or specific IgE blood testing), followed in selected cases by a food challenge. Standard IgE tests may be positive to more than 1 nut, due to cross-reactivity (allergens common to several nuts) or cosensitivity (frequently associated positive test results without cross-reactivity). Thus, many patients with a peanut or a <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergy avoid all nuts, relying on positive test results without clinical evidence of reactivity. In addition, coexisting pollen sensitivity may add to diagnostic uncertainty due to potential cross-reactivity between pollens and nuts. In this article, we discuss challenges in diagnosis and clinical management of peanut and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergy related to cross-reactivity and cosensitization, as well as the avoidance of nuts tested positive {{to reduce the risk of}} reactions by cross-contamination. Studies to provide more accurate characterization of genuine clinically relevant cross-reactivity or cosensitivity to multiple nuts are needed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sesame seed is an {{allergen}} {{of growing}} importance worldwide. However, {{knowledge of the}} clinically relevant sesame allergen and its cross-reactivity with homologous allergens is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was the immunological characterization of Dutch sesame seed-allergic patients and evaluation of cross-reactivity between sesame seed, <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> and pollen allergens using different sources of allergen extracts. Methods: Six patients with a medical history of sesame seed allergy were included, i. e. 5 with an anaphylactic reaction and 1 with an oral allergy syndrome (OAS). The immunological background of the sesame seed and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> IgE sensitization was characterized with Western blotting and a basophil activation test (BAT). The major sesame allergen was identified by nanoLC-MS/MS. Cross-reactivity was measured using an immuno-inhibition assay with the Phadia ImmunoCAP system. Results: Oleosin was identified as the major allergen for the 5 patients with an anaphylactic reaction to sesame seed, but no cross-reactivity between sesame and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> proteins was observed. For the patient with OAS, IgE specific to oleosin was not detected but cross-reactivity between sesame seed and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> proteins was observed. The BAT and ImmunoCAP inhibition test added value to the clinical and immunological characterization of sesame seed-sensitized patients, distinguishing relevant and non-relevant sensitizations. Conclusions: Our immunological approach enabled us to fully characterize the sensitization pattern of 6 sesame seed-allergic patients. The different protein composition of commercially available allergen extracts influences the outcomes of the immunological assays and thus also the diagnosis to a large extent. </p...|$|R
