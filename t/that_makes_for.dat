5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

500|$|In {{anticipation}} of particularly high viewership {{due to the}} Super Bowl, NBC officials encouraged The Office producers to feature celebrity guest appearances in the episode. Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman all made guest appearances in [...] "Stress Relief" [...] as a result. However, they do not interact with the cast and characters of The Office, but rather appear separately in a bootleg film called Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which the characters watch within the episode. Greg Daniels said this was done because it [...] "helps keep the show grounded and less like I Love Lucy". Lieberstein also said the casting decision made sense because, [...] "If we're just casting some salesman that comes {{into the office and}} it's Jack Black, it's hard to believe that." [...] "Stress Relief" [...] marked Black's fourth television appearance in five years: he previously appeared in the Fox sitcom Cracking Up in 2004, the Comedy Central series The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show in 2004, and the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons in 2007.

The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as an excellent episode that added new depth to the show in the scene with Marge trying to convince Luann to let Milhouse play with Bart again. They added that Lisa's [...] "faith in her heroic father makes a nice change", {{and said that the}} episode's ending, in which Homer enters the dictionary, [...] "is most satisfying." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that after the episode [...] "Bart the Murderer", this episode marks a regression, saying it was almost inevitable that it would not match up to the previous episode. He {{went on to say that}} the subplot with Bart and Milhouse was more entertaining. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4/5 rating, writing that he enjoyed the Homer story but found the Bart and Milhouse subplot more interesting. He added that [...] "Milhouse's mom won't allow him to play with Bart because she thinks Bart is a bad influence. It's rare for the show to allow Bart to feel genuine emotion, but there is plenty of it in this episode <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> a nice character oriented story." ...|$|E

500|$|Vocally, Benson {{performs}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] using a whispered, [...] "intense" [...] {{singing voice}} {{as opposed to}} belting, although her performance has also been described as [...] "bigger-than-yourself". Spanning exactly one octave from C4 to C5, the song's limited vocal range allows Benson to effortlessly transition from her speaking to her singing voice, raising and lowering her volume throughout {{in a manner that}} resembles normal speech. In addition to singing using [...] "a light, speech-driven ‘mix’", the singer also incorporates [...] "quirky little comments and girly gestures". According to Screen Rant's Turner Minton, Benson's vocals [...] " [...] a rawness to the song, giving a depth of eagerness to Ariel’s voice <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> a genuine performance", by delivering a vocal track that is a combination of passion, strength, sincerity, angst, emotion and innocence.

Meanwhile, the final line of the song's reprise is sung with [...] "a bit more oomph" [...] than the original, declaring [...] "I don't know when, I don't know how/But I know something's starting right now".

500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 51 reviews. In The Independent, Simon Price called it Vampire Weekend's [...] "most cohesive and convincing effort yet" [...] featuring their most accessible compositions, while Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork said the singing suited the music fluidly on songs that sounded more natural and dynamic than the band's previous work. Alexis Petridis, lead critic for The Guardian, believed Vampire Weekend successfully avoided the gimmicky sounds of their previous albums and wrote more genuine lyrics dealing with mortality rather than [...] "arch depictions of moneyed young Wasp lives". Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo said the songs may sound dense and wordy, but they would be [...] "immediately potent on a purely visceral level" [...] for listeners, [...] "striking a perfect balance <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> what's perhaps the best album of the year". Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone said the album featured a particular spirit and songcraft evocative of urban life, while Robert Christgau appreciated how many twists the coming of age themes revealed. In his review for MSN Music, Christgau found the record similar to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) because of how each lyric and musical element was [...] "pleasurable in itself and aptly situated in the sturdy songs and tracks, so that the whole signifies {{without a hint of}} concept". Greg Kot was more critical in the Chicago Tribune, writing that the group occasionally blundered in an attempt at ingenuity with the songs [...] "Ya Hey" [...] and [...] "Finger Back" [...] while finding the album [...] "darker, slower and weirder" [...] than their previous records. NME journalist John Calvert believed Vampire Weekend had sacrificed [...] "the sonic smarts that made them" [...] on what was an otherwise [...] "gorgeous album".|$|E

2500|$|For Mordecai Kaplan, {{the founder}} of Reconstructionist Judaism, God is not a person, but rather a force within the {{universe}} that is experienced; in fact, anytime something worthwhile is experienced, that is God. God {{is the sum of}} all natural processes that allow people to be self-fulfilling, the power <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> salvation. Thus, Kaplan’s God is abstract, not carnate, and intangible. It is important to note that, in this model, God exists within this universe; for Kaplan, there is nothing supernatural or otherworldly. One loves this God by seeking out truth and goodness. Kaplan does not view God as a person but acknowledges that using personal God-language can help people feel connected to their heritage and can act as “an affirmation that life has value.” ...|$|E
2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Dance", {{was written}} by Alexandra Prinz and Michael Gordon Lange, and is {{described}} as [...] "an uptempo song with a catchy melody." [...] Immediately after its release, the song was predicted by critics to set a new trend in Filipino music. Jojo Panaligan of Manila Bulletin recalled how Nina isn't new to the dance floor anymore, since her first two lead singles, [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Make You Mine", displayed the same groovy vibe. However, none of the two sounds as aggressive as [...] "Dance" [...] in terms of tempo and arrangement. Nina explained her thoughts on the simple reinvention, saying [...] "Few know I love to dance and I’ve always wanted to show that side of me." [...] Lyrically, the song talks {{about a woman who}} wants to get back together with her lover after breaking-up with him. While the verses describe her desire for the relationship, the chorus was written in an opposite manner, where she goes to the club and dances her way to forgetting her lover: [...] "In the club I will raise my hands / I just wanna dance, dance, dance / On the thoughts of a new romance / I just wanna dance, dance, dance."
