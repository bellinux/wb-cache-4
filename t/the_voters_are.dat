He felt that liberalism represented {{the welfare of}} individual people, as opposed to organizations—governments, businesses, etc.—preserving freedom of thought and action. For him, conservatism was concerned with preserving institutions that {{serve the interests of}} people, collectively. Conservatives, according to Flanders, could find themselves offering [...] "reasoned objections to foolish proposals" [...] by emotionally motivated liberals. [...] He observed that, “Even in the established democracies,... <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> easily seduced into leaving politics to skillful politicians who are themselves without a sense of general, social responsibility.” ...|$|E

The reformulation of the 1st Congressional District so that it virtually surrounds [...] "the nation's second-largest saltwater lake" [...] has generated a local joke that in the 1st Congressional District of Louisiana, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> outnumbered by the fish.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{each state}} conducts its own popular vote {{election}} for President and Vice President. <b>The</b> <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> actually voting for a slate of electors, {{each of whom}} pledges {{to vote for a}} particular candidate for each office, in the Electoral College. [...] of the U.S. Constitution provides that each state legislature decides how electors are chosen. Early in U.S. history, most state legislatures directly appointed the slate of electors for each of their respective states. Today, state legislatures have enacted laws to provide for the selection of electors by popular vote within each state. While these laws vary, most states, including Florida, award all electoral votes to the candidate for either office who receives a plurality of the state's popular vote. Any candidate who receives an absolute majority of all electoral votes nationally (270 since 1963) wins the Presidential or Vice Presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, and I hear your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
60|$|It may unquestionably be the fact, {{that if we}} attempt, by publicity, to {{make the}} voter {{responsible}} {{to the public for}} his vote, he will practically be made responsible for it to some powerful individual, whose interest is more opposed to the general interest of the community than that of the voter himself would be, if, by the shield of secrecy, he were released from responsibility altogether. When this is the condition, in a high degree, of {{a large proportion of the}} voters, the ballot may be the smaller evil. When <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> slaves, any thing may be tolerated which enables them to throw off the yoke. The strongest case for the ballot is when the mischievous power of the Few over the Many is increasing. In the decline of the Roman republic, the reasons for the ballot were irresistible. The oligarchy was yearly becoming richer and more tyrannical, the people poorer and more dependent, and it was necessary to erect stronger and stronger barriers against such abuse of the franchise as rendered it but an instrument the more in the hands of unprincipled persons of consequence. As little can it be doubted that the ballot, so far as it existed, had a beneficial operation in the Athenian constitution. Even in the least unstable of the Grecian commonwealths, freedom might be for the time destroyed by a single unfairly obtained popular vote; and though the Athenian voter was not sufficiently dependent to be habitually coerced, he might have been bribed or intimidated by the lawless outrages of some knot of individuals, such as were not uncommon even at Athens among the youth of rank and fortune. The ballot was in these cases a valuable instrument of order, and conduced to the Eunomia by which Athens was distinguished among the ancient commonwealths.|$|E
