40|$|Background and Objectives: Hypertension is {{a global}} health hazard and most cases are first at-tended to by <b>the</b> <b>physicians.</b> Achieving a control {{will depend on the}} knowledge, {{attitude}} and prac-tice of <b>the</b> <b>physicians.</b> We therefore determined the knowledge, attitude and practices of physi-cians on the detection and treatment of arterial hypertension in north-central Nigeria. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 of <b>the</b> 250 <b>physicians</b> attending a continuing medical edu-cation lecture series in Bida was conducted using a pre-validated self administered questionnaire. Results: The mean age of <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> was 41. 05 ± 8. 71 years and 59 (73. 8 %) were males. Forty-one (51. 2 %) of them have practiced for more than 10 years. Arterial hypertension was considered an important health problem by 93. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>physicians,</b> 30 % of them believed that it should not be referred to a specialist. Majority of <b>the</b> <b>physicians</b> request for urinalysis (96. 2 %), electrocardi-ogram (95. 0 %), fasting blood glucose (88. 8 %), blood urea nitrogen (98. 8 %) and fasting lipid pro-file (97. 5 %) to either assess target organ damage or associated co-morbid conditions.

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was {{transformed}} from a localist union federation into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies.

Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
