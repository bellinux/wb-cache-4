40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Current diesel engine {{after-treatment}} {{systems such as}} Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) use ammonia (NH 3) to reduce Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) into Nitrogen (N 2) and water. However, if the reaction between NH 3 and NOx is unbalanced, it can lead either to NH 3 or NOx being released into the environment. As NH 3 is classified as a hazardous compound on the environment, its accurate measurement is essential. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Tuneable Diode Laser (TDL) spectroscopy {{are two of the}} methods that can measure raw emissions from engine exhaust pipes, especially NH 3. However, it is difficult to suggest which method is the right one for measuring NH 3 from engine exhausts. This paper compares the effectiveness of FTIR and TDL methods for NH 3 measurement from diesel engine exhausts, based on tests conducted under well-controlled laboratory conditions. The concentration of NH 3 from a diesel engine was measured under both a steady-state <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> and a <b>transient</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> The NH 3 readings from FTIR and TDL were analysed, for comparison of precision, response time and their accuracy.

The experimental test pattern included a variety of starting conditions, defined by the thermal status of the engine (i. e. the coolant temperature) and its idling speed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of energy flow management strategies {{is essential for}} the success of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which are considered amongst the most promising solutions for improving fuel economy as well as reducing exhaust emissions. The heavy duty HEVs engaged in cycles characterized by start-stop configuration has attracted widely interests, especially in off-road applications. In this paper, a fuzzy equivalent consumption minimization strategy (F-ECMS) is proposed as an intelligent real-time energy management solution for heavy duty HEVs. The online optimization problem is formulated as minimizing a cost function, in terms of weighted fuel power and electrical power. A fuzzy rule-based approach is applied on the weight tuning within the cost function, with respect to the variations of the battery state-of-charge (SOC) and elapsed time. Comparing with traditional real-time supervisory control strategies, the proposed F-ECMS is more robust to the test environments with rapid dynamics. The proposed method is validated via simulation under two <b>transient</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycles,</b> with the fuel economy benefits of 4. 43 % and 6. 44 %, respectively.

Two emission control systems consisting of the three technologies (EGR, SCR, and DPF) were calibrated on a Caterpillar C- 12 heavy-duty diesel engine. Results of these calibrations showed good promise in meeting the 2010 heavy-duty emission standards as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The test case is a 3 D angular sector of the high pressure (HP) turbine assembly of a civil jet engine and includes details of the coolant flow around the blade roots. Proprietary FEA and CFD solvers are used to simulate the metal and fluid domains, respectively. Coupling is achieved through an iterative loop with smooth exchange of information between the FEA and CFD simulations at each time step, ensuring consistency of temperature and heat flux on the coupled interfaces between the metal and fluid domains.

The FEA/CFD coupled result agrees well with corresponding rig test data and the baseline 3 D and 2 D FEA solutions, which have been calibrated using test data.

Averaging of CFD solutions and relaxation is used to overcome difficulties caused by CFD oscillations associated with flow unsteadiness.

In the present work, experimental tests were conducted all the authors' laboratory on a bus/truck, turbocharged diesel engine in order to investigate the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO), smoke, and combustion noise radiation during hot starting for various alternative fuel blends. To this aim, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analyzers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions as well as various other key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test matrix included three different fuels, namely neat diesel fuel and two blends of diesel fuel with either bio-diesel (30 % by vol.) or n-butanol (25 % by vol.). With reference to the neat diesel fuel case during the starting event, the bio-diesel blend resulted in deterioration of both pollutant emissions as well as increased combustion instability, while the n-butanol (normal butanol) blend decreased significantly exhaust gas opacity but increased notably NO emission.

40|$|Non-road mobile {{machinery}} {{is used for}} a range of different operations with varying engine load characteristics. Fuel consumption and emission amounts from such machinery are dependent on the operation performed. The engine load during many of the operations performed is largely transient in nature. However, the majority of fuel consumption and emission data reported in the literature are based on static measurements and engine load patterns not representative of the real use of the vehicle. Emission data derived from the average annual use of agricultural tractors, based on three different typical areas of use, were compared with emission data obtained from European and international standards. The results showed that the emission amounts obtained from the engine load cycles stipulated in European and international emissions regulations were not representative of the real use of non-road {{mobile machinery}}. Furthermore, operations can be performed using a variety of different approaches depending on factors such as vehicle characteristics and driver behaviour. An engine load simulation model was developed and the results from the simulations showed that by using different driving strategies or transmission characteristics, it was possible to affect the emissions for a specific operation without affecting the fuel consumption or duration of the operation. Changes in engine speed and torque, i. e. transients, are likely to affect the fuel consumption and formation of emissions due to periods of time lags in e. g. the fuel injection system or the boost pressure. During normal operations a decrease in the fuel efficiency due to transient loads was detected. The fuel consumption increased with up to 13 % compared with the corresponding steady-state condition. In order to study the effects of <b>transients,</b> special <b>transient</b> <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> were developed. At high transients, both in engine speed and torque, the effects on fuel consumption and emissions were substantial. For example emissions of particulate matter increased with up to twelve times.

The project scope also included novel materials for use in advanced components and designs associated with waste-heat recovery and other concepts for improved thermal efficiency. Caterpillar initially provided ORNL with a 2004 Tier 2 C 15 ACERT diesel engine (designed for on-highway use) and two 600 hp motoring dynamometers. The {{first year of the}} CRADA effort was focused on establishing a heavy-duty experimental engine research cell. First year activities included procuring, installing and commissioning the cell infrastructure. Infrastructure components consisted of intake air handling system, water tower, exhaust handling system, and cell air conditioning. Other necessary infrastructure items included the fuel delivery system and bottled gas handling to support the analytical instrumentation. The second year of the CRADA focused on commissioning the dynamometer system to enable engine experimentation. In addition to the requirements associated with the dynamometer controller, the electrical system needed a power factor correction system to maintain continuity with the electrical grid. During the second year the engine was instrumented and baseline operated to confirm performance and commission the dynamometer. The engine performance was mapped and modeled according to requirements provided by Caterpillar. This activity was further supported by a Work-for-Others project from Caterpillar to evaluate a proprietary modeling system. A second Work-for-Others activity was performed to evaluate a novel turbocharger design. This project was highly successful and may lead to new turbocharger designs for Caterpillar heavy-duty diesel engines.

A continuous-time parameter identification approach, namely the Poisson Moment Functional (PMF) method, is employed due to its superior noise rejection capability. To ensure the applicability of time delay systems, a Smith predictor is employed. The controller design is implemented using a new pole-zero placement algorithm to ensure closed-loop stability.

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2. Among them, the {{verification of}} <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> is generally carried out by using a stopwatch on industrial sites, which is not so reliable. In addition to this, most of commercial hardness testing machines produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle.</b> It implies that even though hardness testing machines are advanced more, the calibration of the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness testing machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R
