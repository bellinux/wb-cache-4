25|$|As Richard Cromwell {{fell from}} power, he envisaged a step towards a freer {{republic}} or “free commonwealth”, {{writing in the}} hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the Ready and Easy Way, because he wanted to invoke <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Old</b> Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.|$|E

[...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures.

500|$|MacPhisto {{was created}} to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called [...] "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold {{platform}} shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, {{similar to that of}} a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical The Black Rider. Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, [...] "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>old,</b> bad old days." [...] MacPhisto sang the closing [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.|$|E
500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players {{who do not want}} to use the pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able to}} appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> days of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E
