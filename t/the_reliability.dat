A generic methodology is thus developed to incorporate both the machine-level and <b>the</b> system-level <b>reliability</b> analyses. Firstly, <b>the</b> machine-level <b>reliability</b> is investigated based on the product dimensional quality and the tool degradation. A novel machine-level quality reliability-integrated model is developed to address the interaction between product quality and tool <b>reliability.</b> <b>The</b> developed machine-level <b>reliability</b> model is then used to estimate <b>the</b> system-level <b>reliability</b> for a manufacturing system with selected configurations.
