5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him.

Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> City.

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E

5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches <b>the</b> <b>old</b> cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes <b>the</b> <b>old</b> cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where <b>the</b> <b>old</b> exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
