5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Technicolor, {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} conscious {{effort on the part of}} Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Copán.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E
5|$|Not only {{credited}} with turning round <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal, he {{is regarded as}} one of the game's first modernisers.

5|$|While many of {{the moves}} made by Grand Met were {{successful}} in generating additional sales and growth, the company continued to experience problems. While Fortune Magazine named CEO Gibbons as its Turnaround Champion for his success in reversing <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the company, several news outlets claimed that the changes he introduced were problematic because they deprived the company of valuable assets.|$|E
5|$|After resigning the {{presidency}} of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become {{the president of a}} mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E

5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. <b>The</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. In that year a Carrara marble statue of Queen Anne, sculpted by Francis Bird was presented to the town by Sir Jacob Bancks, who served as the local Member of Parliament from 1698 to 1715. It originally stood in the parish church but was moved to Wellington Square in 1893, when the marble pedestal and canopy by H. Dare Bryan were added. Lower town and the quay area were rebuilt and <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre.|$|E

5|$|Manning was {{selected}} by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. From 1998 to 2010, he improved <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the struggling Colts franchise and helped transform them into consistent playoff contenders. During his tenure as starting quarterback, Manning led the team to eight division championships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl title, the franchise's first in over three decades, {{as well as their}} first since relocating to Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} {{longer and more}} serious for both the Romans and Samnites. <b>The</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the two sides fluctuated {{throughout}} its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81 had an {{immediate}} impact on <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company's profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of £818,000 on a turnover of £4.6 million in 1980–81 to £8.55 {{million on a}} turnover of £27.17 million in 1981–82. Clive Sinclair {{became one of the}} UK's highest-profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a £1 million bonus on top of a salary of £13,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Gray's Inn {{continued}} to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year. This fall in numbers was {{partly because the}} landed gentry were no longer sending sons who {{had no intention of}} becoming barristers to study at the Inn. In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E
5|$|With Poland's regained {{independence}} {{came the}} {{major change in}} <b>the</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Kraków—now {{the second most important}} city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.|$|E
