5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L.

The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the status}} of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse {{developed}} in Slovenia, via the Lipica stud <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins. Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan as one of their mounts. In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the animal in the care of the stud farm.|$|E
