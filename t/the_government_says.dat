5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

Counter-demonstrations have been held by AKP supporters. Police officers provided security for the marchers, and the march concluded peacefully at Maltepe, Istanbul (where Berberoğlu is imprisoned).|$|E
25|$|According to a {{national}} urban water benchmarking system {{set up by the}} Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA) with the support for the Asian Development Bank, non-revenue water is reported by provincial water companies as having been reduced from 39% in 2000 to around 30% in 2009 on average. However, VWSA itself questions the reliability of these figures. In some cities, non-revenue water is as high as 75%. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> it wants to reduce non-revenue water to 25% by 2015 and 15% by 2025.|$|E

25|$|As much as 70% of Iran’s imports {{could be}} {{substituted}} by domestically produced products. Iran {{has passed a}} law that bans the import of foreign goods and services when similar products or capacities already exist in Iran. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> that 200 thousand new jobs are created with every one billion dollar reduction in imports. Reported issues are increasing the quality of domestic products, adaptation by domestic suppliers to the Iranian consumer tastes and marketing. As part of the resistive economy, the Supreme Leader of Iran has urged Iranians to consume more domestic products over imported ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} defends {{its land}} policy, given the common occurrences of natural disasters such as drought or bad weather. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> that had farmers {{been allowed to}} own land, {{they might have been}} forced to sell it during drought. To prevent this, the EPRDF government believes land ownership should not be privatized. Accordingly, the government states that it should focus on its agriculture sector while it is developing its industrial sector simultaneously, so that it can balance everything once the other sectors are developed and increase productivity. Government transformation of the construction sector, for example, led to a rare construction boom from the early 2000s until cement and other shortages caused it to slow down. The government believes privatization should be employed in the future but not presently. Knowing that constitutional change is required to privatize lands, the government assumed that it would hold a long-term super majority in parliament, to enable it to make the transition.|$|E
500|$|In {{the evening}} of 14 February, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> that Ali {{was part of a}} group of 800 protesters that {{attacked}} eight policemen with rocks and metal rods. The government asserts that the police exhausted their supply of tear gas and rubber bullets in a failed attempt to disperse the crowd, and resorted to the use of shotguns. Witnesses say that there were no demonstrations at the time Ali was shot. They say Ali was seen walking with a group of officers who were pointing their guns at him. As Ali walked away, he was shot in the back by one of the officers. [...] The Ministry of Interior expressed its regret at the incident and announced that the death would be investigated.|$|E

2500|$|STWI, however, {{pointed out}} a number of {{achievements}} during the four years it operated in Guyana: [...] "significant improvements in water quality"; an alleged reduction of non-revenue water from 61% to 44% (a figure that is in contradiction with what <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> {{was the result of the}} audit); an alleged increase in hours of water supplied and system pressure by more than 80%; an alleged increase in revenues from G$ 900m 2002 to G$1.7bn in 2006; the introduction of a customer information and billing system; and emergency supplies during the 2005 floods. STWI also pointed out several factors beyond its control that made it difficult to achieve its contractual targets: a disastrous flood in 2005; energy costs increasing by over 40%; the difficulty of recruiting and retaining qualified Guyanese staff; and the lack of timely government approval of investment programs and of the appointment of key Guyanese staff.|$|E

2500|$|NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well {{as foreign}} {{governmental}} {{institutions such as the}} U.S. State Department, regularly present evidence of the PRC violating the freedoms of speech, movement, and religion of its citizens and of others within its jurisdiction. Authorities in the PRC claim to define human rights differently, so as to include economic and social {{as well as}} political rights, all in relation to [...] "national culture" [...] and the level of development of the country. Authorities in the PRC, referring to this definition, claim that human rights are being improved. They do not, however, use the definition used by most countries and organisations. PRC politicians have repeatedly maintained that, according to the PRC Constitution, the [...] "Four Cardinal Principles" [...] supersede citizenship rights. PRC officials interpret the primacy of the Four Cardinal Principles as a legal basis for the arrest of people who <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> seek to overthrow the principles. Chinese nationals whom authorities perceive to be in compliance with these principles, on the other hand, are permitted by the PRC authorities to enjoy and exercise all the rights that come with citizenship of the PRC, provided they do not violate PRC laws in any other manner.|$|E
2500|$|The men {{proceeded}} {{to take down}} the Chinese flag atop the police station to put up another flag, with conflicting reports about the new flag's design. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>says</b> the flag was black with white Arabic lettering: the Black Standard {{commonly known as the}} [...] "black flag of jihad". Residents interviewed by the Financial Times say it was the [...] "blue half-moon flag" [...] used by Xinjiang independence advocates, while a resident quoted in the South China Morning Post said it was black with a crescent. Nuerbage police station chief Abulaiti Maitiniyazi (Ablet Metniyaz) was a witness to the attack. He recalled shouting to the men in Uyghur for a peaceful settlement, but receiving molotov cocktails and rocks in return. One Han paramilitary officer belonging to people's armed police force was killed by a molotov cocktail when his squad was entering ground level by force. According to Maitiniyazi, it was when the attackers were hacking at the civilian hostages' face, nose and ears with knives with intent to kill that police shot 14 of the assailants to death and captured the other four for questioning, ending the attack within 90 minutes of the initial break-in. Six of the eight hostages were rescued alive, while two Han women hostages were hacked to death during the operation, and four Uyghurs were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.|$|E
