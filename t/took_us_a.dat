500|$|Matty Johns and {{the other}} players were {{investigated}} by police and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing. In May 2009, Johns appeared on the Nine Network's [...] A Current Affair program to explain {{his role in the}} event. He admitted having sex with the young woman, but claimed that it was consensual. He was later described as appearing during this interview like a [...] "broken-down wreck". Johns later said that he [...] "disconnected" [...] for a month after his suspension. He stated that his wife and family experienced [...] "great pain" [...] {{in the midst of the}} publicity. He said, [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to get over it. It pains me they have to go through it again." [...] There was speculation that his media career was over.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] {{to be something that}} people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
60|$|Yes. With some {{modifications}} of the saying, I mean that; but those modifications will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{little time to}} express accurately.|$|R
6000|$|... “Assuredly, señor, {{the roads}} over the passes all start from there, {{and it would}} <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long circuit to avoid the town.” ...|$|R
60|$|PHILIP. Well, {{there are}} certain matters upon which we are {{beginning}} to feel that you might <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little more into your confidence.|$|R
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to get right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell {{into the hands of the}} surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E
2500|$|At first, Eon FM played {{songs that}} [...] "would not be played elsewhere", having no {{playlist}} and avoiding Top 40 songs. Said Armstrong, [...] "we {{thought we were}} going to be the beginning of a new era. It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to realise we were wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Landing a {{recording}} deal in 1991, the group released their debut album Forever My Lady that same year. Writer Ronin Ro maintained, “They no longer resembled gospel singers… Puffy also {{asked them to}} build their mystique by posing for photos with {{their backs to the}} camera, which he borrowed from Guy’s stage show.” The album’s seductive energy showcased DeVante’s songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..." [...] The album went on to sell over three million copies.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{scarcely}} <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> moment," [...] Ellison continued. [...] "Don't stop {{to put on}} your coat; we are {{the last}} in the theatre now." ...|$|R
5000|$|It has <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bloody {{long time}} but by gee {{it was worth}} it! Russell Ebert during the post game award presentations of the 1977 SANFL Grand Final.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{long while}} to get rich, I'm afraid. It makes me tired to think of it. I guess we'd better go to sleep now, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry we}} are so late,' he was saying. 'We couldn't find a button-hook, so it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to button our boots. But you were to the moment.' ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} to reach the carcass, and arduous labor to remove the great pelt. But at last the thing was accomplished, and we {{returned}} to camp dragging the heavy trophy behind us.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of}} an hour's search in the dark to find the rope; but at last we came upon it, and sure enough there was only four or five fathoms in the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is useless," [...] said Leonard at last, {{throwing}} {{down his}} knife in despair; [...] "this wood is like iron, it would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> week {{to cut through}} it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... i wuda tek awi lil taim but awi bin go kom out seef - Literally: [...] "it {{would have}} <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little time {{but we would}} have come out safely" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the only}} way. And {{we might as}} well hurry, for it is getting late and it will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good three hours to get back with such loads." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{teeth were}} chattering. These {{operations}} of salvage had taken time, and it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> further unconscionable time {{to cover the}} distance {{between us and the}} brig as she lay hove-to, her maintopsail aback and her headsails drawing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of}} an hour's hard work {{to put out the}} flames, and it was lucky the powder had blown so much of the decks up that we were enabled to get at the fire without difficulty, and so {{extinguish}} it before it got any great hold.|$|E
60|$|It <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} to work around the islands and draw in close to Anoroc. In the leisure afforded we took turns working on our map, and {{by means of the}} compass and a little {{guesswork}} we set down the shoreline we had left and the three islands with fair accuracy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what time it is, good people? Half-past six, and the Custances are to dine with <b>us</b> at <b>a</b> quarter-past-seven. It will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good hour to get down; what shall we do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas, alas!' he sighed; 'what in {{the world}} shall I do? Why, it would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> year, {{possibly}} our whole lives, to eat up twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{at eleven}} o'clock. It {{is a long}} epistle, and will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> hour to get through; after that we can stroll round, and, of course, you will stop to lunch.|$|R
60|$|These {{arrangements}} <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of}} days or so. On the third we started, without seeing you, my friend, or any one else that I knew, since just at that time every one seemed {{to be away from}} Pretoria. You, I remember, had by now become the Master of the High Court and were, they informed me at your office, absent on circuit.|$|E
60|$|The road {{which led}} from our farm {{to the village}} school crossed a sandy ridge and often in June our path became so hot that it burned the soles of our feet. If we {{went out of the}} road there were sand-burrs and we lost {{a great deal of time}} picking needles from our toes. How we hated those sand-burrs!--However, on these sand barrens many luscious {{strawberries}} grew. They were not large, but they gave off a delicious odor, and it sometimes <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to reach home.|$|E
6000|$|There was a noble good lot of {{them down}} cellar, and it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle {{in one hand and}} a bundle of stuff in t'other, looking as {{absent-minded}} as year before last. He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{few days to}} get settled down," [...] {{answered}} Dave, resting {{on the top of}} a table. [...] "I don't feel much like unpacking yet, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is more of}} it, here, than we had inshore. I {{should say}} there must be nearly a knot an hour, which will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good {{distance}} away from those gentlemen, before morning.|$|R
6000|$|... “It would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> week to {{beat back}} to the island, and we wouldn’t have many {{provisions}} left when we got there,” Bethune pointed out. “I don’t feel keen on facing the long thrash to windward.” ...|$|R
60|$|After we {{got started}} Jone {{seemed to like}} it very well, and we went pretty much all over the town, {{sometimes}} stopping to look in at the shop windows, for the sidewalks are so narrow {{that it is no}} trouble to see the things from the street. Then the men <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little way out of the town to a place where there was a good view for us, and a bench where they could go and sit down and rest. I expect all the chair men that work by the hour manage to get to this place with a view as soon as they can.|$|E
60|$|From the top I had a {{good view}} of the offing, and of the coast for leagues. We were now quite a mile at sea, and, though the tide was no longer of any use to us, we were drawing through the water quite at the rate of two knots. I thought that the flood had made, and that it <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little on our lee-bow, hawsing us up to windward. Just as I had got the last lanyard fastened, the canoes began to appear, coming round the island by the farther passage, and {{promising}} to overtake us in the course of the next twenty minutes. The crisis demanded decision, and I determined to get the jib on the ship. Accordingly, I was soon on deck.|$|E
60|$|We rose early, {{and taking}} the {{necessary}} precautions, bathed in the pool. Then we breakfasted, and having filled every available receptacle with water, which <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time as these included a large tank that supplied the bath, so {{that we might have}} at least a week's supply in case of siege, we went on deck and debated what we should do. In the end we determined to stop where we were and await events, because, as I pointed out, it was necessary that we should discover whether these natives were hostile or friendly. In the former event we could hold our own on the ship, whereas away from it we must be overwhelmed; in the latter there was always time to move inland.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} would {{certainly}} be the best plan. At present we are groping altogether in the dark, and it will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> fortnight at least to make that row of holes close to each other, as you propose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a pity," [...] said Frank, as he {{crouched}} behind a projecting rock, [...] "that it's out of shot! It would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> hour {{at least to}} get behind it, and there's little chance, I fear, of its waiting for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There is no saying, señor. An {{ordinary}} gale will seldom be felt above {{a hundred}} or {{a hundred and fifty}} miles; but a big one, as this will I think be, may <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> thousand miles before we can get on our course again.” ...|$|R
