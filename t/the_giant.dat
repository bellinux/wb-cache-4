5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site.

5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), as well as <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
