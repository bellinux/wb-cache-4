5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E

5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BBC archive {{specialist}} James Insell {{established the}} Colour Recovery Working Group, an online project {{to find new}} ways of restoring black-and-white telerecordings to colour. In 2008, Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell, developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the black-and-white signal to recreate the missing color. This technique was initially used as part of the recolouring process on episode 3 of Planet of the Daleks; the chroma dot process was used alongside a computer-based colourisation process to match together the differing qualities of colour recovery. The process was then used on an entire episode of Dad's Army, showing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> use it on entire recordings.|$|E

Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he realized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran {{had been out of}} film school for two years and {{was trying to figure out}} how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E

Ornament is used with such restraint <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the piano nobile, or the first floor, and state rooms. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E

5|$|The last Sabre {{conversion}} {{course was}} completed in December 1970. Early the following year, the Australian government announced that the Sabres were to be phased out and retired by July 1971. At this time RAAF fighter pilots were trained progressively on the CAC Winjeel, Macchi, Sabre and Mirage, but after considering the feasibility of direct Macchi-to-Mirage conversion, and the impracticability of maintaining the ageing Sabres, the government determined <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> remove the Sabre from the process and retire the type, on the proviso that more Mirage trainers were made available; it subsequently approved the purchase of six new Mirage IIID dual trainers to augment the ten already in service. No.5 OTU was disbanded on 31July 1971, the date the Sabre was retired from RAAF service. The unit's Macchis were transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E

5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the British {{government}} requested Australia's {{assistance to}} combat communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency. In response, the Australian Defence Committee determined <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> commit {{a squadron of}} eight Douglas C-47 Dakota transports and a flight of four to six Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. The Federal government formally announced the decision to send the Dakotas soon afterwards; in late June, it confirmed the allocation of six Lincolns. No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of No.82 Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, and be based at Tengah airfield in the west of Singapore. No.38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Dakotas, would be detached from No.86 Wing at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and be based at Changi, in Singapore's east. The transport commitment was rendered possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service during the Berlin Airlift.|$|E
5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered {{the city by}} assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed {{the terms of the}} peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> artificially chill water with {{mechanical}} equipment and attempts {{were made in the}} late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E
5|$|The realist {{narrative}} {{style of}} Pather Panchali {{was influenced by}} Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River (1951). Ray, {{a founding member of}} the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica's neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.|$|E
5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E
