In vehicle industry, it has been trends towards focusing on pull-based systems and elimination of waste (Lean), which decrease the tied-up cap-ital level in the focal factory. Research by Holweg & Miemczyk (2002) showed that the relevant supply chain has low inventory level in the fo-cal factory, but at upstream and especially downstream; the <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> level is dramatically higher in comparison to the focal factory. By conducting research and extensive literature reviews, this volatil-ity of <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> level has been studied and analysed with regard to push and pull systems. As the three main causes of this unevenness; bull-whip effect, CODP position in supply chain and intensity level of supplier relationship have been identified and explained. As a practical solution for decreasing the <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> level of fin-ished vehicles, implementation of centralised warehouse structure has been suggested and discussed. Moreover, as an application of game theory in logistics, iterated prison-ers ’ dilemma has been discussed as the base for a progressive relationship with suppliers (upgrading to win-win game) which is requisite for the suc-cess of pull-based supply chains...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{working capital}} is an {{important}} aspect of a firm’s financial strength in terms of ability to finance its daily operations and growth. By releasing <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> and increasing inventory turnover, a firm’s working capital can become more efficient. Based on this, the purpose of the thesis is to investigate which business processes that cause excess <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> in finished goods and create a set of actions for speeding up inventory turnover without decreasing the current service levels. In order to reach the purpose a case study based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodology was carried out. A first phase of qualitative data collection through interviews was performed. In the next phase extensive amounts of quantitative data was collected from the case company’s ERP-system. The quantitative data was then analyzed and complemented by another phase of qualitative data collection. The analysis is built around a framework developed by the researchers, which categorizes finished goods inventory in relation to how these inventories were created and how they are governed. Each category is then analyzed and the results suggest that lack of appropriate information sharing and transparency along with conflicting KPI’s and prioritizations between various functions and actors in the order to delivery process result in excess <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> in finished goods. Furthermore, the fact that the company on which this case study is based, offers a flexible product mix, but lacks an efficient system for matching configured engines with new customer orders tend to slow down inventory turnover. Suggestions for improvement include the adaption of a more holistic view across processes, functions and actors through better communication and information sharing as well as an improved search and allocation functionality for configured engines...|$|E

The optimization aims to maximize utilization of machines {{and at the same time}} minimize <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> by manipulating 56 unique decision variables. A recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm that has achieved successful results in various problem domains called Cuckoo Search is used to perform the simulation-based optimization. To handle multiple objectives, an extension of the original Cuckoo Search algorithm based on the concept of Pareto optimality is proposed and used in the study. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in comparison with the benchmark algorithm NSGA-II. Results show that the combinatorial nature of the optimization problem causes difficulties for the Cuckoo Search algorithm, and a further analysis indicates that the algorith might be best suited for contiunuous optimization problems...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} have {{called into question}} the established principles of successful business management. These developments find expression in the increasing saturation of "first world" markets, where demand tends towards individualization. Reasons are a demographic shift resulting in an aging population and a fragmentation of target groups. In addition, an ongoing and deepening process of internationalization and deregulation has taken place over the past years. It has opened up new sales and supply markets, but also initiated {{a new type of}} competition at international level. From a technological point of view, the innovation cycles have steadily shortened due to new technological solutions at product and process level and in information and communication technology. Numerous expert papers on manufacturing engineering describe the trend towards a more dynamic environment, along with more customized products, using the terms "turbulence" or "environmental turbulence". A highly complex and dynamic environment makes it difficult to generate forecasts and confronts manufacturing companies with new challenges in global competition. Customers call for highly customized products with state-of-the art technology to be delivered as soon as possible, while being less and less willing to pay for it. To remain successful, companies must counteract the increasing requirements at product, price and service level. The future will only see those companies survive in the market that continue to meet the exact needs of their customers. These companies must be able, at any time, to identify new trends or spark new ones. With a lower degree of vertical integration, they need to focus on their core competencies and produce products in value chains or networks of competent, creative and innovative companies. That is why learning how to manage a network, and to think and to act in terms of a network, are essential capabilities. Many of the activities carried out by companies - often to cut down on costs - increase the significance of high-quality network management. Examples are known as "global sourcing", "outsourcing" (focus on core competencies by contracting out value-adding activities, e. g. modularization in vehicle construction), but also the ongoing reduction of stocks and the amount of <b>capital</b> <b>tied-up.</b> A greater inclusion of partners distributed across the world, as well as the reduction of safety stocks to a minimum, require a well-functioning network. To this must be added the growing market demand for short delivery times, for a more flexible handling of customer change requests and for high schedule reliability. As a result, the call for greater stability and flexibility does not only affect the network as a whole, but each individual customer-supplier interface in the network. Moreover, the number of interfaces grows with ongoing intertwining of the network. Above all, these changes require raising the quality of process synchronization in order to optimize the customer-supplier-interfaces. Several solutions have been pursued as part of supply chain management, but they do not go far enough. The following three key problems arise in industrial practice: - There are no universal indicators - resulting in a lack of visibility - which allow to measure the quality of a customer's order and call-off patterns. That's why this advance information is not considered appropriately, even though it has a considerable impact on the delivery performance of the supplier. - There are numerous turbulence germs in the companies that trigger fluctuations in the order and call-off patterns. There is a lack of methods to identify and eliminate self-induced turbulence. - Growing environmental turbulence results more often in externally driven turbulence, i. e. market- or consumer-driven turbulence. There are no appropriate approaches in science and business that enable arrangements which minimize turbulence between customer and supplier. The aim of this thesis is therefore to find concrete solutions to the three problems described above in order to contribute to the process synchronization of customer-supplier interfaces. The quality of the customer-supplier interface is a key determinant of competitiveness in a manufacturing environment where series products are manufactured at regular intervals over an extended period. Both the continuous order flow and the deliveries at short intervals provide the necessary basis for a model that allows analyzing and designing the order pattern. The model developed in this thesis is based on two key components for the analysis and design of order patterns. The first part describes a method to quantify order patterns {{so that they can be}} sorted into quality categories. A company can thus assess both its own order pattern as well as that of its customers. The outcome allows interpreting the order pattern. The interpretation determines if and how problematic the measured order pattern is for the network and if this order pattern is "logically comprehensible". The analysis model considers the four key trouble spots identified when assessing the state of the art. These four areas of action require taking into full consideration the three dimensions of order quantity, order date and delivery date, the identification of actual customer needs, the risks associated with fluctuation, and the relationship between fluctuation characteristics and possible causes of fluctuations. This interpretation provides the basis for the design part of the developed model. It recommends specific actions to eliminate self- and externally induced turbulence germs. Specific cause-and-effect relationships referring to exemplary fluctuation patterns and associated typical 'obstacles' in real life help to reduce the self-induced order fluctuations. Due to the fact that many turbulence germs are externally induced and therefore cannot be avoided, this thesis suggests how customer and supplier can handle the expected fluctuations by agreeing on fluctuation margins. The analysis of the "state of the art" revealed two major criteria: specific dependencies between products or variants in terms of flexible delivery need to be considered, and a practical approach developed for customers and suppliers to come to such an agreement. The model presented here makes an important contribution to improving collaboration at the customer-supplier interface and thus to making networks more stable. The model has been verified by an abstract data model proving that the requirements set for such a model can be satisfied. Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|R
40|$|Ein immer turbulenter werdendes Umfeld und die damit verbundenen höheren Anforderungen an die Stabilität und Flexibilität von ganzen Netzwerken stellt Industrieunternehmen vor eine neue Ausgangssituation. Die veränderten Umfeldbedingungen sind mit Risiken verbundenen, bieten aber allen Beteiligten auch die große Chance, sich zukünftige Wettbewerbsvorteile zu sichern. Das Thema gewinnt insofern an Bedeutung, als eigentlich jedes Industrieunternehmen ungeachtet seiner Größe tagtäglich in Netzwerken über seine zahlreichen Schnittstellen agiert. Genau hier unterstützt die vorliegende Arbeit die Schaffung einer neuen Qualität der Prozess-Synchronisation an der Schnittstelle zu anderen Unternehmen. Die hier formulierten Anforderungen und die Darstellung des Standes der Technik zeigen, dass verbesserte und neue Prinzipien, Verfahren und Modelle zur Harmonisierung von Kunden-Lieferanten-Beziehungen notwendig sind. Das in dieser Arbeit entwickelte Modell basiert auf den zwei Kernbausteinen Analyse und Gestaltung von Bestellverhalten. Im ersten Teil wird eine Methode zur Quantifizierung von Bestellverhalten beschrieben, mit deren Hilfe das Bestellverhaltens einer Güteklasse zugeordnet wird. Ein Unternehmen kann damit sowohl sein eigenes Bestellverhalten oder das seines Kunden bewerten. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse wird dann das Bestellverhalten interpretiert. Diese Interpretation belegt, inwieweit das gemessene Bestellverhalten ein Problem im Netzwerk darstellt, und inwieweit dieses Bestellverhalten „logisch nachvollziehbar“ ist. Das Analysemodell berücksichtigt dabei die wesentlichen vier Handlungsbedarfe, die bei der Bewertung des Standes der Technik identifiziert wurden. Diese vier Handlungsbedarfe beziehen sich auf die ganzheitliche Berücksichtigung der drei Dimensionen Bestellmenge, Bestelltermin und Zeitpunkt der Bestellung, die Identifikation des tatsächlichen Kundenwunsches, die mit einer Schwankung verbundenen Risiken sowie den Zusammenhang zwischen Schwankungscharakteristik und möglichen Schwankungsursachen. Diese Interpretation liefert damit die Basis für den Gestaltungsteil des hier entwickelten Modells. Darin werden konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für eigen- und fremdinduzierte Turbulenzkeime vorgeschlagen. Bei der Reduzierung eigeninduzierter Bestellschwankungen helfen konkrete Ursachen-Wirkungs-Zusammenhänge zwischen beispielhaften Schwankungsmustern und dazugehörenden typischen „Stolpersteinen“ aus der Praxis. Da sich eine Vielzahl an Turbulenzen aufgrund ihres fremdinduzierten Charakters nicht vermeiden lassen, wird dargestellt, wie Kunde und Lieferant die zu erwartenden Turbulenzen mittels Schwankungskorridoren vereinbaren können. Bei der Analyse des „Standes der Technik“ wurden zwei besonders wichtige Kriterien identifiziert: die Berücksichtigung spezifischer Abhängigkeiten zwischen Produkten oder Varianten bezüglich der Lieferflexibilität sowie eine praxisnahe Vorgehensweise für Kunde und Lieferant zur Erlangung einer derartigen Vereinbarung. Das hier vorgestellte Modell leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur besseren Zusammenarbeit an der Schnittstelle Kunde-Lieferant und damit zur Stabilität ganzer Netzwerke. Die Verifizierung des Modells mit einem abstrahierten Datenmodell belegt, dass die Anforderungen an ein derartiges Modell erfüllt werden können. Darüber hinaus können auch Teilelemente des entwickelten Modells in der Praxis eingesetzt werden, etwa bei der Vereinbarung einer Kunden-Lieferanten-Vereinbarung, die auch ohne vorangehende {{retrograde}} Analyse des Bestellverhaltens möglich ist.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{a concept}} for materials supply called call-off production, {{used by the}} telecom company Ericsson, where a case study was performed. Call-off orders are initiated from the production area and submitted through electronic data interchange (EDI) to an external supplier, a third-party logistics provider, skipping the traditional purchase ordering process. In call-off production Ericsson applies two forms of kanban for triggering the replenishment, namely the conventional kanban card and electronic kanban. For both variants, call-off production implies a short lead time, frequent deliveries, {{and the potential for}} controlling <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital,</b> using few resources, and providing a high level of delivery service. The study indicates that the conventional kanban card requires more handling than electronic kanban. On the other hand, electronic kanban could hide problems in the stock. To conduct the analysis, a theoretical framework and an analysis model were created as a foundation. Call-off production could be an uncomplicated and efficient method for manufacturing companies to manage some of the purchased products. This study’s intended contribution is to increase the knowledge of a supply model in practice...|$|E

40|$|In {{almost all}} supply chains, {{materials}} {{need to be}} stored or buffered, implying that manufacturing companies need effective replenishment methods. However, this is challenging, since companies must balance inventory costs and customer service in complex and different situations. Therefore, {{it is important to}} choose replenishment methods carefully. One well-known and widespread method is Material Requirements Planning (MRP). But the method has problems, such as regarding volume flexibility. There are other methods, but the literature lacks case studies and detailed descriptions and analysis of them, especially for visually oriented methods. Therefore, it is important to explore different methods for materials supply. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the application of visually oriented replenishment methods in manufacturing industry and further to design a tentative decision tool for selecting methods. The research aims to provide some answers to three key questions. The first research question concerns general factors that are important for evaluating how effective replenishment methods are. From the literature review, different factors emerged such as product characteristics (fit in the Kraljic matrix, volume issues, size, etc.); information, trust, and geographical proximity between supplier and customer; and different logistics goals (delivery service elements, <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital,</b> use of resources, inventory accuracy). It is also import to include the basic principles methods are related to. The factors were summarized in an analysis model, which is structured with three main areas (planning environment/conditions, basic principles, and effects). The model is used to analyze four case studies. The  second research  question focuses  on  the  characteristics for  visually orientedreplenishment methods. Examples of characteristics are: easy to understand and operate, offers uncomplicated flows, substantially applicable for noncritical and leverage parts with high yearly requirement and fairly even consumption, provides potential for  reduced  errors  in  stores/flows, potential for  providing high  delivery service and low levels of <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> and resource utilization. The third research question focuses on what a tentative decision tool for selecting replenishment methods might look like, based on the factors that emerged from the other research questions and studies by others. In order to achieve an efficient materials supply, companies need to consider these factors when selecting replenishment methods. The decision tool consists of different steps, considering aspects of the planning environment/conditions in relation to the product and the supplier. The importance of the companies’ goals/motives for materials supply must also be assessed. The output from the decision tool is appropriate replenishment methods. QC 20130603 </p...|$|E

Logistics Services central warehouse in Eskilstuna ensures that parts are available all over the world, material is transported to the production facilities, packaging is available and vehicles are distributed to the dealers. The current need is to reduce costs and improve the production process at the Inbound department. The aim of this project has been to analyze the current flow of materials and <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> in the inbound flow and give improvement suggestions on reducing lead times and the <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital,</b> as well as give suggestions on common performance metrics for all the sub departments at Inbound. The report is based on theoretical and empirical study, where the theory concerns the topics; logistics, lean philosophy and supply chain management. The empirical study was carried out by data collection through time measurements in the plant and by BEAT-report, observations and discussions with the operators, and interviews with production managers and process developers. The collected data was analyzed and the products in the flow were divided into groups, where the inbound material flow was mapped by the VSM tool. Product groups were analyzed by amount of received material reports, quantity, value and lead time, and the product groups that tied the highest value were defined as well as where in the flow the value was located. For each sub department calculations on production capacity and utilization were performed to analyze the current state and be able to compare the departments with each other. The interviews contributed with knowledge to create a reliable and valid SWOT analysis for each sub department at Inbound, where common factors could be defined concerning deviations, performance metrics and other hidden problems, but also opportunities. Finally, in this report the current state in the Inbound department has been analyzed. Products have been categorized into groups and the materials flow mapped. It has been defined where in the flow and how much value that is tied up, and by which product groups. Hidden problems and deviations have been brought up to surface. Improvement suggestions have been given concerning decreasing of lead times and the tied up value, and also suggestions on common performance metrics for all the sub departments have been given...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} the in-transit distribution strategy is investigated by determining and analyzing key {{principles of the}} strategy. It is examined through a multiple case study and simulation. This research reveals that the in-transit distribution strategy is about considering goods that are being transported as a mobile inventory and actively dispatching goods to a destination, {{where there is a}} predicted demand before any customer orders are received. It can give major competitive advantages by offering rather short lead-times for customers without having to store products locally. This, in turn, gives lower warehousing costs, lower <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital,</b> a less interrupted manufacturing, and steady as well as continous production volumes. It is a workable solution for European manufactures competing in distant market. To be successful with this strategy, it takes good planning, working closely with customers, first-class market kowledge, and a supporting enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Other highlighted requirements are low variation in demand and predictable distribution lead-time. Simulation study of one hypothetical product group verified case study findings, but we find it interesting that especially manufacturing output variance is very sensitive regarding the overall results. Also increasing average customer demand results in undesired outcomes...|$|E

Background: The research {{is based on}} Papyrus Sweden, a paper merchant, which is facing {{a decrease in the}} demand of paper products. It was identified that inventory level reduction is now crucial for the company in order to stay in the market. Therefore, Papyrus Sweden is focused on inventory level and <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> reduction in order to decrease costs and increase net profit. Purpose: This thesis aims to analyze the current situation in Papyrus Sweden in terms of inventory level and activities related to suppliers, and prepare recommendations which could help Papyrus Sweden to reduce its inventory level. Method: The data has been collected through interviews with managers from the supply chain department as well as through a data sample from Papyrus Sweden database given to the researchers. All data was analyzed and compared with the literature review. Data received from the database was processed and transformed in Microsoft Excel {{in order to make the}} analysis. Results: The analysis identifies issues in material planning methods, safety stock calculation, ABC-XYZ classification and forecast calculation, on which Papyrus Sweden could act in order to decrease its inventory level.

40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} interested in improving their operations {{with the purpose}} of boosting company performance, which can be impacted through enhanced working capital management. Inventory management is one area that can help release working capital to other investments. In particular, the inventories in the end of supply chain are a potential phase for improvements, because these mostly tie up capital. In international trade, the commonly accepted trade terms, Incoterms, determine where the main risks and responsibilities are exchanged between the trade parties, and the companies can recognize their sales as revenue at this point. Therefore, one opportunity for decreasing the <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> is to select the delivery terms, Incoterms, differently in the supply chain. The Incoterms are defectively studied in the academic literature, and there are {{only a small number of}} papers deepening the knowledge surrounding the topic. The relationship between the delivery terms and working capital management seems to be unobserved in these previous studies and hence this thesis examines if the amount of the goods-in-transit inventories is dependent on the delivery terms used in inter- and intra-organizational contracts. This thesis is conducted as a single case study and a mixed methods approach was selected as the applied research strategy as it enables reaching a wider perspective in the topic. The quantitative data describes the potential correlation between the choices of the delivery terms and the inventories, while the qualitative data from the interviews brings a practical approach to this research. The study found that the relation between the goods-in-transit inventories and the delivery terms was not significant, but rather the flow of information and the internal process reasons seemed to determine the inventory time in the case company...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{collaboration}} between members in {{a supply chain}} is often a necessity to stay competitive among other supply chains. In order to succeed with this collaboration, information sharing is vital. One way of sharing information and {{making it possible for}} a supplier to manage the replenishment of a customer’s inventory is by utilizing Vendor Managed Inventory, VMI. This is a concept that has been appealed by the cab producer Volvo Trucks in Umea. The purpose with this thesis is to prepare for an implementation of a pilot project of VMI at Volvo Trucks in Umea. Another purpose of this thesis is to investigate which key performance indicators that should be included in an upcoming evaluation of the project. The implementation process were executed in an interplay between the authors’, Volvo Powertrain, Volvo Information Technology, PipeChain and Volvo Trucks in Umea. Parallel to the work with the implementation process was a literature study carried out. This study made it possible for the authors’ to analyze the material found in the literature review with the actual implementation of VMI at Volvo Trucks in Umea. The method used to identify key performance indicators, when evaluating VMI, began with a literature review. Interviews were then held with two case companies, Volvo Powertrain and Ericsson. Finally, findings from the interviews were compared and analyzed with theories found in the literature review. Conclusions of the thesis indicate that an implementation of VMI takes time. Experiences from the implementation process also imply that substantial resources must be available before and during implementing a resource demanding pilot project, covered in this thesis. Key performance indicators that especially should be inspected in an upcoming evaluation are: administration cost, inventory cost {{and the size of the}} <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital.</b> Volvo Trucks in Umea also recommends to carefully examining the work pattern for involved material controllers during the pilot project. Finally, the thesis states that the measurement of suppliers’ customer service should be expressed in terms of service level rather as in delivery precision and delivery reliability.

40|$|The {{importance}} of capacity planning has increased since many companies have reduced their inventories of finished goods to decrease unnecessary <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital.</b> At the same time, these companies {{want to have}} the possibility to respond to fluctuations in demand. The fluctuations that previously were absorbed by the inventories have now been transferred upstream to the production sites. As a result of this transfer, high performance of the capacity planning is essential and problems have to be mitigated. Many companies believe in lean as an approach to improve processes and thereby gain competitive advantage. However, it is unclear if lean can be an approach to mitigate problems in a capacity planning process. With this background, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how companies can apply lean principles in their capacity planning process. This thesis was conducted as a case study at Nobel Biocare. Three research questions were formulated. The first question concerns the identifying of problems in the capacity planning process. In order to answer this question, 11 interviews were conducted at Nobel Biocare. Research question two investigates how lean principles can be used to mitigate the identified problems in the capacity planning process. Inspiration from three reference companies that have implemented lean principles in their capacity planning process were used as input to answer this question. The last research question was formulated to assess how the solutions could be applied into a model. A structure of the capacity planning process was used as a basis for categorising the solutions into three parts; preconditions for planning, planning hierarchy and planning cycle. The result of this thesis is that 17 problems were identified in Nobel Biocare’s capacity planning process. 13 out of these 17 problems could be mitigated with the use of lean principles. The conclusion is that companies will become more customer-focused by applying lean principles in their capacity planning processes. The findings of this analysis have been summarised in a model called the lean capacity planning process. Based on this model recommendations to Nobel Biocare have been given. The thesis’s contribution to theory is a starting point for closing the gap of how lean principles and capacity planning can be combined. By following the model, lean capacity planning process, companies can improve their capacity planning process and thereby increase competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Materials {{management}} i. e. {{management or}} planning of material flows has received an increasing interest for decades. The competitiveness of companies is greatly {{affected by the}} companies’ {{ability to respond to}} market pressures for increased customization and short lead times. The trade-offs for increased product variety and shortened lead times are increased costs for storage and purchasing of materials. GMC is a manufacturing company, which is working actively to fulfill customer demands on product variety and short lead times. This puts pressure on the company's materials management systems to ensure that material flows and inventories are both flexible and cost efficient. GMC therefore created an inventory management process, which aims to reduce <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> in inventory and improve the service level towards customers. GMC are however experiencing some challenges with this process. The process incorporates both the production function and purchasing function and extends across different planning levels, which creates communication barriers. The company furthermore has both MTS and MTO manufacturing strategies for its products and uses several different planning methods to manage the material flows. This makes it important to ensure that the planning methods are used in a suitable context. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the process and provide suggestions for improvements. The study was based on three research questions relating to the challenges experienced at GMC. The research method has been qualitative with data collection focusing on interviews. The empirical investigation presents a mapping of the process in its current state. The investigation shows that the planning methods kanban, MRP and consignment stock are used in appropriate contexts, but that there is no process that continuously ensures fit between planning methods and individual parts. It was also discovered that the challenges experienced with achieving functional integration in the process to a large degree were caused by ambiguities and uncertainties of the process boundaries and unclear division of responsibilities within the process. The investigation furthermore highlighted the fact that decisions regarding safety stock levels were almost entirely managed on operative level and that there was little transparency of these decisions to higher planning levels. The recommendations to GMC are: create a process for continuous matching between individual parts and planning methods; improve the functional integration through improved process management and monitoring; and lastly to improve the alignment between operative and strategic planning levels regarding safety stock decisions by implementing documentation routines and an inventory classification system to increase the transparency of decisions behind the safety stock levels...|$|E
40|$|Although {{working capital}} {{is one of}} the key issues in {{managing}} day-to-day operations, it has not gained sufficient emphasis in financial literature until the late 1990 s. Since then, efficient working capital management has been highlighted more in both academic research and managerial decision-making, thus raising acknowledgement of competitive advantage it can create. This master's thesis studies the impact of working capital on corporate profitability and shareholder value in 1, 683 publicly listed US computer and electrical equipment companies in 1990 ? 2013. Using fixed effects regression methodology in a relatively homogenous sample of 16, 481 observations, this thesis contributes to existing literature by presenting an in-depth analysis of working capital management in a specific industry. Previous research mainly supports the theoretical assumption of a negative impact of working capital on profitability. However, unlike most prior papers solely assuming a linear effect of working capital on profitability, this thesis also addresses a quadratic relationship. The empirical results show a concave impact of cash conversion cycle on return on assets, which indicates that there exists an optimal level of working capital, resulting in a balance between risks and returns, hence maximizing profitability. Accordingly, deviations from the optimum reduce return on assets as a too low level of working capital increases the risk of illiquidity and distress costs, whereas too high level increases <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> and thus opportunity costs. By contrast, cash conversion cycle is found to have a negative impact on return on equity and stock return. Consistent with previous studies, this indicates that an in increase in the level of working capital reduces the company value for equity holders. In that way, investors prefer excess funds to be used in long-term investments or paid out as dividends. The findings accentuate the contradiction of different benefits for the company itself and its shareholders regarding working capital management. Different time frames for different measures need also to be taken into account since profitability reflects the magnitude of current earnings, whereas market value shows the future expectations of shareholders. However, shareholders are also more interested in short-term returns, whereas holding a sufficient level of working capital may ensure long-term profitability. Consequently, the level of working capital maximizing return on assets does not necessarily lead to high stock returns and vice versa. Above all, managers in computer and electrical equipment industry can increase returns and market value by paying more attention on effective working capital management and acknowledging the difference of benefits for the company and its shareholders. In any case, working capital is a particularly important topic in computer and electrical equipment industry due to the continuous development of technology and rapid changes in business environment. However, as this thesis is limited to one industry and country only, caution is needed when generalizing the results to different kinds of samples...|$|E
40|$|Supplier and {{customer}} markets {{have become more}} global and have forced companies to consider restructuring their supply chains {{to take advantage of}} opportunities in terms of costs, competence, etc. at different locations. One way to take advantage of opportunities in other locations is to outsource parts of the production to suppliers. Production outsourcing implies change from in-house material supply to purchasing materials from a supplier; therefore, production outsourcing can affect material supply in terms of delivery reliability, lead times, and product quality. The focus of this thesis is how the production outsourcing transition from making to buying a product affects material supply. The overall purpose of the thesis is to understand how to ensure reliable and efficient material supply during the whole outsourcing process. With the whole outsourcing process is included from before physical transfer where the decision to outsource is made until a steady state is reached with a continuous supply from the new source. The thesis is answering three research questions using the results of six appended papers. The six papers are based on five studies, i. e., two single case studies, two multiple case studies, and one simulation study. Empirical data in the case studies were mainly collected through interviews with staff working in the outsourcing companies. The first research question identifies what logistics considerations are necessary for each of the phases of a general outsourcing process, in order to accomplish a well functioning supply chain during production transfer and start-up and steady state after physical transfer. The second research question provides a framework for the evaluation of the consequences of outsourcing and the impact on <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital,</b> product quality, customer service, and delivery flexibility of sourcing from a specific supplier. Further, the simulation study showed that supply chain performance can be improved through how the different parts of the supply chain are utilised, which can be accomplished through a sourcing strategy of sourcing stable demand globally and handle uncertainty locally. The third research question describes the material planning environment during production transfer and start-up and shows how the choice and application of the material planning process during production transfer and start-up affects supply chain performance. In the discussion, the results from the research questions were combined and a framework how to ensure material supply during the whole outsourcing process was outlined. The thesis contribute to the material supply research area by identifying how existing processes and methods within the material supply area must be adapted to fit the specific conditions of outsourcing. Contributions to the outsourcing research area are made by showing that to ensure materials supply, the whole outsourcing process has to be in focus i. e., from before physical transfer where the decision to outsource is made until a steady state is reached with a continuous supply from the new source...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the {{influence}} of advanced manufacturing technologies on company’s performance. The aim of this contribution is to suggest the suitable concept of performance management that enables to measure the influence of advanced manufacturing technologies. The introductory part of the article defines the term “advanced manufacturing technologies” (AMT) as information technologies for the storage of data and their subsequent processing. A complex and lucid view onto the company performance and generators of this performance provides the concept of Kaplan and Norton referred to as Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The goals and measures are based on the vision of a strategy of the company and monitor its performance from the four following perspectives: financial, customer-related, internal processes, learning and growth. The utilization of BSC can be amplified by the emphasis on the value-based approach to the management of performance. The value orientation of BSC can be attained by properly selecting the value-based indicator, for example Economic Value Added (EVA), as the top criterion of the financial perspective of BSC. EVA (net operative profit minus capital expenses) measures {{the extent to which the}} company contributed in the given period by its activities to the increase or decrease value for the owners. The allocation of capital should be in accordance with the fundamental goal, which is to accept only such projects that will generate value thus contributing to the creation of EVA. A great advantage of the concept EVA is the possibility of linking strategic and operative decision-making and utilizing it on all levels of management by searching for and supporting of so-called value-generators. The approach BSC allows a complex view on effects from the introduction of AMTs without any aspect to be omitted. By acquiring AMT the perspective of learning and growth is supported significantly. AMTs require an intensive utilization of sophisticated information systems, which makes demands on abilities and qualifications of the employees so that they are able to work effectively. The perspective of internal processes is also significantly influenced by utilizing AMTs. Their utilization may lead to reduced amounts of material usage, to reduction of stocks of materials, to acceleration of the manufacturing cycle, better utilization of the manufacturing equipment, acceleration of development and to an increase of the number of innovations. At the same time it is possible to assume that these technologies reduce the number of necessary employees. The result will be reduced costs, higher quality of products, lower number of defects etc. By providing a better quality product faster that meets the specific requirements of a customer, the customer can be more satisfied. However, AMT often mean high expenditures during their acquisition (negative effect on cash flow during the acquisition) and resulting higher costs in individual years of their service life due to depreciation. Investment into AMT usually ties up the long-term capital that provides the expenses. Increased revenues from sales of products or services and cost savings must exceed the disadvantage of high acquisition costs and <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> bearing costs. Only in such a case the acquisition and operation of AMTs can lead to a positive EVA and to an increase of the company value. Our research suggests that these frameworks are in fact complementary and can be very affective when used together...|$|E
40|$|Background – {{inventory}} management theory {{has in the}} past been focused on traditional engineering industries. These theories are not completely applicable on industries such as FMCG where the main objective is to avoid obsolescence and not <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital.</b> A part of the FMCG industry that is especially pressured by short shelf lives is the food industry. The food industry has also the disadvantage that the customers demand instant deliveries, which makes production to order impossible. Arla Foods is a dairy company that is struggling with high and increasing wastage costs. The wastage cost is generated from products where last sales date is exceeded and Arla Foods CSE therefore has to trash the products even if the best-before date is still valid. These costs need to be reduced on both short and long term. Hence Arla Foods is perfect as a case company for this study. Purpose – the ulterior {{purpose of this study is}} to seek if the current theory is applicable on the food industry. This is investigated through a case study at Arla Foods with the following questions asked: Which factors drives wastage costs at a global dairy company such as Arla Foods? How do the factors relate to each other? Which actions could be taken to reduce the wastage costs at a global dairy company such as Arla Foods? To what extent could these findings be generalizable? Method – a thorough literature study is conducted to create an understanding of the existing theories. The case study is mainly based on interviews and observations with employees at Arla Foods. Data has been extracted from internal data bases and processed to complement the interviews and observations. Conclusion – the case company showed that the most significant wastage drivers on an article level were forecast deviations and batch size/delivery frequency. However, the main wastage drivers at Arla Foods were nothing that could be found in neither supply chain management nor {{inventory management}} theory – this was instead problems related to work process, organization, communication and strategy. Suggested solutions to these problems are among others: Going through the worst performing articles’ set-up in a structured way. Making sure that there exists a clear process and that all employees are educated in it. Having a back-up plan on what to do with excessive inventory. Using follow-up reports as tools to take action from. When these problems have been solved, Arla Foods can instead focus on planning principles such as taking steps towards a more integrated collaboration with their customers via Efficient Consumer Response. The findings are not proved to be general in any way, but the conclusion of the report still states that there is a high probability that these findings could be applied on other companies within the food industry in general and within the dairy industry in specific. If this is the case, then it is shown that the current theory lacks several aspects when it comes to food industry – aspects that maybe do not have the same importance within most of the traditional engineering industries. Originality – the literature review conducted before the case study did not show any other case study or research that has made an equally broad overview. Earlier studies have mainly been focused on that the food industry is in need of customized planning principles and systems. That research has in the end advocated implementation of Efficient Consumer Response or similar...|$|E
40|$|As {{international}} competition increased {{towards the end}} of last century, companies realized the importance of collaborating and sharing information with suppliers and customers to remain competitive. By sharing information such as forecasts of future demand with partners in the supply chain, it was possible to lower inventory holding costs and increase the service level to customers, and thereby increase the competitiveness of the involved companies. Previous research has proposed several benefits related to information sharing in supply chains. Suggested benefits include, for instance, better planning and scheduling of production lines, improved allocation and utilization of resources for transportation and warehousing, and reduced inventory levels and <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital.</b> However, it appears that few companies have been able to implement and benefit from information sharing. Several researchers conclude that information sharing in the supply chain is limited. Particularly, it seems as if companies {{have not been able to}} benefit from sharing information across multiple tiers in the supply chain. The lack of information sharing across multiple tiers is a challenge which is important to address considering that companies continue to struggle with problems related to the, so called, bullwhip effect. A supply chain which suffers from the bullwhip effect can experience distorted demand information as it is shared upstream in the chain. Such variations in demand information can lead to incorrect production planning and thereby alternately high inventory levels and increased costs for overtime and rush orders. Against this background, several questions arise: For what reasons do companies refrain from sharing information across multiple tiers despite the fact that literature suggest that it is beneficial? Further, are there any companies that have implemented information sharing across multiple tiers and, if so, what are the documented benefits? Searching the answers to these questions reveals a gap in literature in that the majority of previous research studies have focused on dyadic relationship (i. e. supplier-buyer) instead of multi-tier supply chains (e. g. supplier-manufacturer-customer). The purpose with this dissertation is therefore to move beyond the dyads and explore information sharing in the supply chain, and investigate opportunities and challenges involved with sharing information across multiple tiers. The purpose is addressed in three separate but connected studies. Following a pilot study, a systematic literature review is conducted to establish current knowledge in the research area. Thereafter, two empirical studies are conducted: a case study which maps an entire supply chain where data is collected from multiple tiers; and a Delphi study including a panel of experts who share their insights through multiple questionnaires. The findings indicate that companies, for different reasons, refrain from sharing information across multiple supply chain tiers. One reason is the many challenges involved with implementing information sharing across multiple supply chain tiers. The major challenges include lack of trust between companies; lack of information quality; difficulties to share risks and benefits; lack of business processes; and the lack of a dominant player who can initiate change in the supply chain. Many companies are also preoccupied with internal issues and lack the ability to engage in information sharing across the supply chain. Another reason, from the perspective of contingency theory, seems to be that information sharing across multiple tiers is only beneficial in few, particular contexts. Such contexts relate to planned changes in the supply chain, for example in relation to new product introductions when future demand is uncertain. Findings also suggest a negative inter-relation between important and feasible contexts. In other words, in cases where it is possible to implement information sharing it is perceived to be less valuable and in cases where it is more valuable it is more difficult to implement. The findings further suggest that companies focus their information sharing with supply chain partners that represent high intensity of interdependence. Interdependence theory can thus help to explain why companies mostly share information with dyadic, strategic partners where the partners represent a large percentage of each other’s portfolio and turnover. Moving beyond the dyads, the intensity of interdependence is reduced as firms are embedded in many networks and often have multiple suppliers and customers. The willingness to engage in multi-tier information sharing is therefore reduced. This dissertation, which is one of the first to study information sharing in the extended supply chain, indicates that information sharing across multiple tiers is a rare phenomenon in industry. The dissertation also points out that several aspects must be considered to be able to implement and benefit from information sharing across multiple tiers. One of the contributions of the dissertation is a conceptual framework which can be used to guide future research and also function as decision support for companies to address and implement multi-tier information sharing...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{enterprises}} {{have always}} searched {{for ways to}} improve efficiency. For {{the past few years}} there has been an emphasis on stock-keeping levels. Increased demand for fresh round timber and the need to decrease the amount of <b>tied-up</b> <b>capital</b> has made the forest industry reduce its inventory levels. This has brought on a higher demand on the timber supply from the forest management districts concerning both delivery in time and assortment output. As a result, the flow of timber has fluctuated a lot with serious consequence for the timber supply during 1994. One reason was unexpected weather conditions which lead to transportation stops. This MSc thesis deals with the planning of logging operations and the problems that are involved in that process for SCA Forest and Timber. This study was initiated by the wood procurement and transportation department, Virke syd, and Strömsund's forest management district within SCA. The purpose is to formulate a flexible and optimizing model for decision-support in short-term planning and follow-up of logging operations. The decision-support involves linear programming in order to minimize the cost of cross­ cutting losses, delivery bonus-losses and moving the logging machines from on logging unit to another. The aim is to increase the adaptability between timber request and logging result on assortment level. A seeond objective is to make a survey offactors that influence the possibility for forest management districtsto achieve a continuous timber yield in time and assortment output. The validity of the model in this paper is limited to the planning techniques and philosophy used within SCA and their short-term planning routine. The linear programming model involves: • a planning horizon of one to two months • optimization of logging unit selection regarding rnachine resources in the ranger district • five assortments; pine and spruce timber, pulpwood of softwood, fresh cut spruce and hardwood • four cross-cutting alternatives; minimal top-diameter of timber; 12, 14, 16, 18 cm. A result from an optimization gives a logging unit selection that minimizes the costs, earlier mentioned, for periods extending from a couple of days up to two months. The main thesis is that decision concerning resource allocation is to be taken "just in time". The advantage with this procedure is that the decision maker has the latest information regarding the actual wood flow and can make more accurate decisions. To improve management and the linear programming model a continuously increasing delivery bonus system has been constructed to allow the forest managementdistrictsto equalize their logging operation costs with the bonus. To refine the decision basis, harvester measurement of timber volume has been used in the decision-support system, to make simple yield forecast for logging units. Results from the decision-support system run on material from Strömsund's forest management district have involved a large amount of moving logging resources between logging units. This is mainly due to a relatively large difference between pulp wood and timber prices. U sing the current timber and pulp wood prices the marginal cost for cross­ cutting adjustments usually exceeded the cost for shifting a logging unit. This is also related {{to the size of the}} logging unit, whereas larger logging units have a low shifting cost per cubic meter. Major conclusions: • Output estimations used within SCA short-term planning routines suffer from bias and random errors. The most serious are the area estimation and the assortment output functions. This makes it difficult to maintain a continuous timber yield in time and assortment output in shorter periods. • The decision support model that this study focuses on can be used on a practical basis hut there is a substantial risk for suboptimization if the planning period is shorter than a month andfor the wood flow demands are set too high. • The use of "intelligent" computer based planning routines such as the model constructed in this study could improve decision-making if the decision-maker fully understood the fundamentals in economic optimization and the use of computers. The key is to use common sense with computer-based planning. • The use of harvest measurement, instead of wood measurement at milis, would improve both planning and foliow-up with more accurate, daily based logging unit related measures. This would refine the decision basis for the planner and make it possible to do yield forecasting. • Increase the logging team's influence and co-operation especialiy in areas concerning wood flow planning and follow-up. This would not only give interesting task's for the logging team's, it could also give faster more pliable solutions in the area of interest. • Search for unconventional solutions in keeping a good wood flow; for example aliocate more than one logging team to a logging unit, move logging resources to logging units that give a more appropriate wood flow, change cutting form, etc...|$|E
