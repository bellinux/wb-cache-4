Differences between the two types of suspension and among the disease types were examined with a two-way analysis of variance. Cells release...|$|R
5000|$|Kuai (...) was a Chinese dish {{consisting}} of finely cut strips of raw fish or meat, which was popular and commonly eaten {{in the early}} history and dynastic times of China. According to the Book of Rites (禮記) compiled between 202 BC-220 AD, kuai consists of small thin slices or strips of raw meat, which are prepared by first <b>thinly</b> <b>slicing</b> the meat and then cutting the thin slices into strips. In modern times, the dishes are more {{often referred to as}} [...] "raw fish slices" [...] (...) or as [...] "yusheng" [...] (魚生, yúshēng).

50|$|English {{photographer}} John Carbutt {{founded the}} Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 {{with the intention}} of producing gelatin dry plates. The Celluloid Manufacturing Company was contracted for this work by means of <b>thinly</b> <b>slicing</b> layers out of celluloid blocks and then removing the slice marks with heated pressure plates. After this, the celluloid strips were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion. It is not certain exactly how long it took for Carbutt to standardize his process, but it occurred no later than 1888. A 15 in sheet of Carbutt's film was used by William Dickson for the early Edison motion picture experiments on a cylinder drum Kinetograph. However, the celluloid film base produced by this means was still considered too stiff for the needs of motion picture photography.|$|R
25|$|The exact origin is unknown, {{but many}} {{believe it was}} created by Italian {{immigrants}} who worked for Chicago's old Union Stock Yards in the early 1900s. They often would bring home some of the tougher, less desirable cuts of beef sold by the company. To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted {{to make it more}} tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor. Both the roasting and the broth used Italian-style spices and herbs. The meat was then <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> across the grain and stuffed into fresh Italian bread.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{typically}} Danish {{contribution to the}} meals {{of the day is}} the traditional lunch or smørrebrød consisting of open sandwiches, usually on <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> rugbrød. The meal usually begins with seafood such as marinated herring, smoked eel, crab, or breaded plaice filets with remoulade and moves on with slices of roast pork or beef, frikadeller (meatballs), hams and liver pâté. The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise. The meal is mostly accompanied by beer, on occassion also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> in sandwiches.|$|E

25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. <b>Thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E

500|$|Suillus spraguei is an edible mushroom. Its {{taste is}} not distinctive, {{although}} the odor {{has been described}} as [...] "slightly fruity". Although it turns a blackish color when cooked, some consider it choice, and [...] "among the better edibles in the genus Suillus." [...] In contrast, another source on mushrooms of Québec described the mushroom as a poor edible ("comestible médiocre"), and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor. Michael Kuo's 2007 book 100 Edible Mushrooms rates the taste as mediocre, suggesting [...] "its sluglike consistency has all the palatability of unflavored gelatin." [...] The book recommends frying the <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> mushroom in butter or oil until it acquires a crispy texture.|$|E
500|$|Parsnips {{resemble}} {{carrots and}} can be used in similar ways, but they have a sweeter taste, especially when cooked. [...] They can be baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, or steamed. When used in stews, soups, and casseroles, they give a rich flavor. In some cases, parsnips are boiled and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew, leaving behind a more subtle flavor than the whole root, and starch to thicken the dish. Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner {{in some parts of the}} English-speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast. Parsnips can also be fried or <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> and made into crisps. They can be made into a wine with a taste similar to Madeira.|$|E
500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid out on trays and waiters continued bringing out trays until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind."). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years.|$|E

40|$|A sharp {{temperature}} optimum {{is observed}} at 21. 5 °C when {{the incorporation of}} [14 C]sucrose into starch is measured with discs cut from developing tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Desirée). By contrast, increasing temperatures over the range 9 to 31 °C only enhance release of 14 C to respiratory CO 2 and incorporation of 14 C into the ethanolsoluble fraction. By comparison, starch synthesis in discs from developing corms of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott) is increased by raising the temperature from 15 to 35 °C. The significance of a relatively low temperature optimum for starch synthesis in potato is discussed {{in relation to the}} yield limitations imposed by continuously high soil temperatures. Amyloplasts isolated from protoplasts prepared from developing potato tubers contain activities of alkaline pyrophosphatase, NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, and phosphoglucomutase in addition to ADP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase, starch phosphorylase and starch synthase. Cell-free amyloplasts released by <b>thinly</b> <b>slicing</b> developing potato tubers synthesize starch from [14 C]triose-phosphate generated from [14 C]fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate in the reaction medium. This starch synthesis is inhibited by addition of 10 millimolar inorganic phosphate and requires amyloplast integrity, suggesting the operation of a triose-phosphate/inorganic phosphate exchange carrier at the amyloplast membrane. The temperature optimum at 21. 5 °C observed with tissue discs is not observed with amyloplasts...|$|R
