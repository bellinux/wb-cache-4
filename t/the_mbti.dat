40|$|The {{ability to}} acquire iron from the {{extracellular}} environment {{is a key}} determinant of pathogenicity in mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis acquires iron exclusively via the siderophore mycobactin T, the biosynthesis of which depends on the production of salicylate from chorismate. Salicylate production in other bacteria is either a two-step process involving an isochorismate synthase (chorismate isomerase) and a pyruvate lyase, as observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a single-step conversion catalyzed by a salicylate synthase, as with Yersinia enterocolitica. Here we present the structure of <b>the</b> enzyme <b>MbtI</b> (Rv 2386 c) from M. tuberculosis, solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at a resolution of 1. 8 Å, and biochemical evidence {{that it is the}} salicylate synthase necessary for mycobactin biosynthesis. The enzyme is critically dependent on Mg 2 + for activity and produces salicylate via an isochorismate intermediate. MbtI is structurally similar to salicylate synthase (Irp 9) from Y. enterocolitica and the large subunit of anthranilate synthase (TrpE) and shares the overall architecture of other chorismate-utilizing enzymes, such as the related aminodeoxychorismate synthase PabB. Like Irp 9, but unlike TrpE or PabB, MbtI is neither regulated by nor structurally stabilized by bound tryptophan. <b>The</b> structure of <b>MbtI</b> is <b>the</b> starting point for the design of inhibitors of siderophore biosynthesis, which may make useful lead compounds for the production of new antituberculosis drugs, given the strong dependence of pathogenesis on iron acquisition in M. tuberculosis...|$|R
50|$|The first {{personality}} {{tests were}} developed in the 1920s and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces. Since these early efforts, {{a wide variety of}} personality tests have been developed, notably the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (<b>MBTI),</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and a number of tests based on the five factor model of personality, such as the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.|$|R
25|$|Jung's {{typology}} theories postulated {{a sequence}} of four cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition), each having one of two polar orientations (extraversion or introversion), giving a total of eight dominant functions. <b>The</b> <b>MBTI</b> is based on these eight hypothetical functions, although with some differences in expression from Jung's model (see Differences from Jung below). While the Jungian model offers empirical evidence for the first 3 dichotomies, {{it is unclear whether}} the Briggs had evidence for the J-P preference.|$|E
25|$|Type not trait: <b>The</b> <b>MBTI</b> sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.|$|E
25|$|These {{results suggest}} that the four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that <b>the</b> <b>MBTI</b> lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>MBTI</b> provides a Reported Type, this is considered only an indication of their probable overall Type.

In more than 20% of cases, the hypothesis and the Reported Type differ in one or more dichotomies. Using the clarity of each preference, any potential for bias in the report, and often, a comparison of two or more whole Types may then help respondents determine their own Best Fit.|$|E
