5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, <b>the</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{of these}} {{restrictions}} were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even <b>the</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs, General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, <b>the</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, <b>the</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E
