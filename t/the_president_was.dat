50|$|<b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} by <b>the</b> {{speaker of the}} Assembly of the Republic when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> abroad.|$|R
50|$|In {{carrying}} out certain of their constitutional functions, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> aided by <b>the</b> Council of State. There is no Vice-President in Ireland. If {{for any reason}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> unable to carry out his/her functions, or if <b>the</b> Office of <b>President</b> <b>is</b> vacant, <b>the</b> duties of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>are</b> {{carried out by the}} Presidential Commission.|$|R
5|$|The first Pennsylvania {{constitution}} in 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the state's executive branch, with the President as its head. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.|$|E
5|$|The text of Barber's {{telegram}} to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{printed on}} the front page of The New York Times on April 14, and a first-hand account of the siege at the T.A. appeared in The Times and the Chicago Herald and other papers.|$|E
5|$|With {{some help}} from Peter Donahue and O.M. Wozencraft, on May 26, 1857, after an {{introduction}} from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs James W. Denver, Kinman presented the chair to Buchanan. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> so pleased by the present that he bought Kinman a rifle and two pistols in return.|$|E
50|$|In Transnistria, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> elected directly, {{while in}} Moldova, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> elected by <b>the</b> parliament, the {{political}} structure of Moldova being a parliamentary republic.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> of Georgia <b>is</b> Head of State. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> a {{guarantor}} of national independence and {{unity of the}} country. He/she ensures the functioning of state bodies in accordance with <b>the</b> Constitution. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> representative of Georgia in foreign relations.|$|R
50|$|The {{executive}} power <b>is</b> vested in <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> Philippines. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> elected by popular vote. The principal workplace of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Malacañang Palace in San Miguel, Manila. The executive branch is currently headed by <b>President</b> Rodrigo Duterte. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, The second highest official is elected separately from <b>the</b> <b>President</b> by popular vote. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>is</b> {{first in line}} to succession if <b>the</b> <b>President</b> resigns, <b>is</b> impeached or dies. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>is</b> usually, though not always, a member of <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> cabinet. If there is a vacancy {{in the position of}} vice-president, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> will appoint any member of Congress (usually a party member) as <b>the</b> new Vice <b>President.</b> <b>The</b> appointment must then be validated by a three-fourths vote of the Congress.|$|R
5|$|During Washington's administration, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> given broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. Congress passed a bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against {{a bill that would}} have mandated senatorial consent for the removal of Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E
5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. He appears to be {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
50|$|The 1945 Constitution: <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> {{assisted}} by <b>the</b> vice-president {{and his or}} her ministers. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> also able to seek advice from the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA).|$|R

5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> liked and admired, and the press and public had {{followed}} his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Lane {{returned}} to San Francisco {{to open the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> supposed to open the fair, {{but was unable to}} attend, and sent the Interior Secretary in his place. In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to lead the American delegation and meet with the Mexican commissioners at Atlantic City, New Jersey about the unstable military situation in Mexico. These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> also {{provided}} a variety of powers, like defining {{the policy of the}} country. Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leader of the winning party.The only [...] "relevant" [...] post that is not directly appointed by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party.|$|R

5|$|Jamila and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{directed}} by Ratna Sarumpaet, a women's rights activist. The film, Sarumpaet's directorial debut, {{was based on}} a theatrical drama she had previously made entitled Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), which was put on in 2006 in five cities by Satu Merah Panggung Theatre Troup. She was inspired write the story in 2005 after UNICEF approached her to do a survey of child trafficking in Southeast Asia and promote awareness of the problem. While writing the original script, Sarumpaet interviewed prostitutes in Surabaya, Surakarta, Garut, and Borneo over a period of six months. This research carried over into the film.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had {{focused more on}} military, foreign affairs and the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{met with}} the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{concerned}} that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At {{the end of the}} meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further.|$|E

5|$|On 1October 1965, a {{group of}} Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling {{themselves}} the 30September Movement killed six Army generals and announced that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> under their power; the coup was quashed the following day. Contemporary reports indicated that the PKI had been behind the G30S, a position endorsed by the Indonesian government. As a result, {{hundreds of thousands of}} registered and suspected PKI members were killed or exiled over the following decade, effectively destroying the Party. By 1974 Buru held some 10,000prisoners, while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad. Political prisoners began to be released by the 1970s, but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society: they found themselves under surveillance and with little hope of employment.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was {{presiding}} over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in {{to tell him that}} his brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon told him that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been afflicted by a stroke suffered two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were {{right-wingers}} of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. Any civilian aircraft <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> aboard is designated Executive One for <b>the</b> flight. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> also has access to a fleet of thirty-five U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> aboard any particular one in the fleet.
