Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply {{of the city of}} Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E
500|$|Declaring that {{he would}} [...] "fight like a wounded animal" [...] for re-election, Mugabe {{approached}} the 2013 elections believing {{that it would be}} his last. He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility. The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe. They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by the military, although at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.|$|E

He got {{a degree in}} animal nutrition from Iowa, worked as a builder, produced rodeos, staged and performed Western music jamborees, and worked as an advertising manager for a radio station from 1962 onwards. Holt later said of this period:Do you {{realize that this is}} the first time in my life that I can make my own decisions and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> First it was my parents who <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then RKO <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then I went into the service and Uncle Sam <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I came back out and RKO still <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This is the first time I have not been under somebody's thumb in my life.http://comicvine.gamespot.com/red-mask/4005-1345/ ...|$|R

Leading Fireman Charles Hendrickson saw crowds of third-class passengers below decks with their trunks and possessions, as if waiting for someone to direct them. Psychologist Wynn Craig Wade attributes this to [...] "stoic passivity" [...] produced by generations of being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by social superiors.

Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, {{and it made me}} think that so many people spend their lives being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by people that they just don't like.

Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with [...] "Overprotected", [...] "Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others." [...] She also compared [...] "Overprotected" [...] with the singer's first reality show, [...] (2005), saying that [...] "Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins." ...|$|E

This must go further than the mere [...] "hope" [...] that the beneficiary (again I believe this should read [...] "trustee" [...] - the beneficiary is the passive party to a trust) of the will will act in accordance with its terms. The requirements for a half-secret trust to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in Blackwell v Blackwell, where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked. Prior to the testator's death, the trustees had all been <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the property. Lord Sumner said that: ...|$|E
500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Jeff Ament {{wrote the}} lyrics for two {{songs on the}} album ("Gods' Dice" [...] and [...] "Nothing as It Seems"), and Gossard for three ("Thin Air," [...] "Of the Girl" [...] and [...] "Rival"). The album is lyrically darker than the band's {{previous}} album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty somber." [...] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album's lyrics by stating, [...] "I think what everyone's looking for, y'know, is freedom...That's part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I {{had a problem with}} being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to know when you have it, too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1930s, {{with the}} Labour Party split and weakened, Bevin co-operated with the Conservative-dominated {{government}} on practical issues. But {{during this period}} he became increasingly involved in foreign policy. He was a firm opponent of fascism and of British appeasement of the fascist powers. In 1935, arguing that Italy should be punished by sanctions for her recent invasion of Abyssinia, he made a blistering attack on the pacifists in the Labour Party, accusing the Labour leader George Lansbury at the Party Conference of [...] "hawking his conscience around" [...] asking to be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it.|$|E

2500|$|Manuel, {{a waiter}} played by Andrew Sachs, is a well-meaning but disorganised and {{confused}} Spaniard from Barcelona with a poor {{grasp of the}} English language and customs. [...] He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> he often responds, [...] "¿Qué?" [...] ("What?"). Manuel's character is used to demonstrate Basil's instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode involves Basil becoming enraged at Manuel's confusion at his boss's bizarre demands and even basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty's quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given employment. He is relentlessly enthusiastic and is proud of what little English he knows.|$|E

In contrast to the silent Jack from BioShock, the player character Booker is also given a voice, a decision to avoid complacency with the [...] "silent protagonist" [...] motif as well to have face-to-face interactions with other non-player characters instead of being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> over a radio or separated by a barrier.|$|E

Wedge, who was scheduled to fight Guy Buckles in front of 2,000 fans over six rounds on a sand bar south of Omaha, Nebraska, announced his retirement before the bout to devote his life to Christian service and then gave Buckles a religious tract and a New Testament. Buckles, who was insulted by Wedge's actions, punched Wedge on the nose, however Wedge refused to retaliate, choosing instead to [...] "turn the other cheek". However, after another blow from Buckles, Wedge indicated: [...] "I have not been <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next, but I guess I can pound you to pulp without interfering with my conscience". In the ensuing altercation, both fighters were severely disfigured, but Wedge was adjudged the winner. Wedge indicated that he would pray for Buckles.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January, the AEU's Portsmouth branch ordered {{its members}} not to {{participate}} in the campaign, with its district secretary Rory McCarthy explaining that [...] "there are many reasons why the union is against giving [...] half hours to employers" [...] and that employers might use it to hide inefficiencies. The workers at the factory immediately rebelled, with works convener Harry Tyler saying [...] "no one likes being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with their free time by the union" [...] and said that some who were opposed had changed their view because of the union's attitude. Tyler was removed from his post as union branch chairman by a vote of no confidence on 5 January after members of the branch from companies not taking part in the campaign went to the regular branch meeting. Some of the secretaries who started the campaign appeared on television discussing the trade union reaction with union leaders; the trade union leaders came across as talking down to the secretaries, an attitude that was felt to have helped the campaign.|$|E
