30|$|The {{same problem}} is seen {{for the quality}} of the datasets. Economic network data such as input–output tables usually contain errors, or they always just {{constitute}} an approximation, which is a central issue in input–output analysis (e.g., Dietzenbacher 1995, 2006). Due to the errors, the same problem mentioned above appears in cluster analysis. That is, the clustering analysis could be very sensitive to the employed algorithms and datasets. In fact, the actual datasets used for constructing the supply-chain networks of Kagawa et al. (2015) are estimations derived from <b>the</b> multi-regional <b>input–output</b> <b>framework</b> (e.g., Lenzen et al. 2012; Dietzenbacher et al. 2013).

We identify the sources of the changes in Japan's energy use structure between 1985 and 1990.

40|$|The {{concern of}} the thesis is to clarify the {{structural}} relevance between market areas and supply areas through the investigation of firm location under the given conditions of market demand, deposit of inputs and technologies for production. Conventional economic analysis studies a solid interaction between input and output, through {{the structure of the}} production function, by means of the duality theory in <b>the</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>framework.</b> This corresponds to the framework of market areas and supply areas in location theory. However, the existing market-area analysis and supply-area analysis focus examination on an independent framework, and a series of approaches has not been sufficiently developed. Although the integrated framework of both types of area would be treated as an extended version of the duality theory, the framework would not be complete unless the analysis took additional spatial factors into consideration. These factors are suggested to be parts of spatially unconstrained and constrained internal and external economies. The spatially constrained types of economies are called agglomeration economies and these, together with spatially unconstrained types of economies, constitute the neglected factors in existing market-area analysis and supply-area analysis. As agglomeration economies have a trade-off interaction with transportation costs, an analysis of assembly and distribution transportation costs is also required. This research clarifies these neglected factors and considers them with the duality theory, applying <b>the</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>framework</b> to both types of area analysis. This alternative approach not only demonstrates the effects of market area change on the spatial structure of supply area and vice versa, but also investigates the incentives governing the determination of the firm location...|$|E

40|$|A first {{approximation}} of the intermediate consumption matrix {{is necessary in}} the process of regionalization of national input-output tables, according to the available information at regional level. Different possibilities appear for this adjustment as could be: using location quotients, gravity models or commodity balance. Then, the most efficient solution should be searched by correction methods. The use of location quotients is correct to generate domestic tables, but their traditional formulations do not detect cross-hauling and, therefore, it involves an overestimation of the domestic intermediate consumption. This paper proposes a modification of this formulation smoothing magnitudes that interfere with the updating processes, so it is feasible to estimate gross exports and imports matrices. For practical purposes, a calibration procedure will be formalized in order to optimize the results of the bi-regional table between Galicia and the rest of Spain.

We also find a growing impact on the economy of private services and transportation, communication, and storage sectors, {{probably due to the}} globalization of these activities. Overall, however, the services sector exhibits lower intersectoral linkages than the manufacturing sector.
