5|$|The {{book has}} a tightly logical structure, and {{presents}} a bold argument. Illustrations {{are used as}} an integral part of the argument, with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time. A brief introduction sets out <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the book.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E

Second chapter compares developed countries in term of exchange-rate regimes and capital liberalization with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> specification of development in Mundell - Fleming trilemma. Third chapter compares developing countries in term of exchange-rate regimes and capital liberalization with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> specification of development in Mundell - Fleming trilemma. Finally, are developed countries with developing countries compared {{in terms of this}} trilemma. Another <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> my bachelor thesis is to find out if these countries follow a muster in their development in terms of the trilemma...|$|R
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|Back {{home she}} resumes {{her job as}} a {{physiotherapist}} in Soweto. Then in June 1976 Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in Afrikaans. They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the banned SACP and African National Congress (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.|$|E
5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady lobbying for future missions. <b>The</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself and Jupiter. Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E

Research questions  How effective are pharmacotherapies in helping people cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  How effective are different combinations of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products in helping people cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  How effective are ‘nicotine-containing products’ in helping people cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  How effective are behavioural support, counselling, advice or self-help (with or without pharmacotherapy) in helping people to cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely, without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  Is there an optimal period to help people cut down or abstain (temporarily or indefinitely) from smoking without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  Is it more or less effective {{to draw up a}} schedule to help people cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely, without <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> quitting?  Do some tobacco harm-reduction approaches have a differential impact on different groups (for example, people of different ages, gender, socio-economic status (SES) or ethnicity) ?  Are there any unintended consequences from adopting a tobacco harm-reduction approach; for example, does it deter people from trying to cut down or abstain from smoking, temporarily or indefinitely...|$|R
30|$|Two {{types of}} coding: open coding and axial {{hierarchical}} coding were applied. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> open coding is to generate as many codes {{as possible to}} identify relevant themes. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> axial coding is to generate the interconnections between these themes.|$|R
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. <b>The</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> Intercultural Information Ethics (IIE), as Ess aptly puts, is to “(a) address {{both local}} and global issues evoked by ICTs / CMC, etc., (b) in a ways that both sustain local traditions / values / preference, etc. and (c) provide shared, (quasi-) {{universal}} responses to central ethical problems” (Ess 2007 a, 102). This formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE, however, is not unambiguous. In this paper, I will discuss two different understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE, one of which advocates “shared norms, different interpretations” and another proposes “shared norms, different justifications”. I shall argue that the first understanding is untenable, and the second understanding is acceptable only with qualification. Finally, I shall briefly suggest an alternative way to understand <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE...|$|R

5|$|In August 1932 {{there was}} an {{unsuccessful}} uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had been particularly appalled by events in Castilblanco. <b>The</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who {{would go on to}} distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the Duke of Seville, Martin Alonso, Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed Swine Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market. The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products, conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations. As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command {{did not come to}} expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by Irish republicans with <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> ending British rule in Ireland and establishing an Irish Republic. Organised by the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members of the Irish Volunteers, {{joined by the}} smaller Irish Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of Britain.|$|E

The band learned their studio output was not as easy to re-create live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{proposals}} {{were published in}} March 1958, and a new bill was introduced under the Ten Minute Rule, failing to gain the requisite support. After A. P.

It was introduced to the House of Lords by Lord Birkett, received the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, and came into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E

5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could be seized or repainting {{demanded by the}} Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.|$|E
