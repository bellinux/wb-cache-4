500|$|As a {{means of}} augmenting the meagre {{allowance}} provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions <b>to</b> <b>gossip</b> columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, Highland Fling, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when {{it was published in}} March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, Christmas Pudding. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the [...] "Bright Young People" [...] and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of [...] "Bobby Bobbin", and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it could not possibly be published under Mitford's own name.|$|E

Fox had learned of the photographs some weeks earlier, and to contain the potentially disastrous effects on her career, the studio and Monroe had decided to talk about them openly while stressing that she had only posed for the photos while she was in a dire financial situation. The strategy succeeded in getting her public sympathy and increased interest in her films: the following month, she was featured on the cover of Life as [...] "The Talk of Hollywood". Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with other publicity stunts that year, such as wearing a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the Miss America Pageant parade, and by stating <b>to</b> <b>gossip</b> columnist Earl Wilson that she usually wore no underwear.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to take forever to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively <b>to</b> <b>Gossip</b> Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny but trying to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers figure out which ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he laughed with pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E

But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references <b>to</b> <b>Gossip</b> Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E
