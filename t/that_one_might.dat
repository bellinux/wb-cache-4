5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was the sense <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
25|$|Video game {{development}} and authorship, much {{like any other}} form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. Video game developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include programmers and graphic designers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the game designer. All of these are managed by producers.|$|E

25|$|Very little can be {{said about}} Ba Zaw’s works in spite of his great {{influence}} on Burmese painting because, to date, only about five of his works have surfaced. Three of the works are watercolors on permanent display {{in the collection of the}} National Museum of Myanmar, one of which appears in Ranard’s Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History. It is a watercolor landscape bearing the orange, brown and yellowish tones <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect of a painter influenced by J. J. Hilder. The works in the National Museum have historical importance, but they cannot be called remarkable.|$|E
25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|No Man's Sky is {{primarily}} {{designed as a}} single-player game, though discoveries can be shared to all players via the Steam Workshop, and friends can track {{each other on the}} game's galactic map. Hello Games' Sean Murray stated <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> spend about forty hours of gametime to reach the centre of the galaxy if they did not perform any side activities, but he also fully anticipated that players would play the game in a manner that suits them, such as having those that might try to catalogue the flora and fauna in the universe, while others may attempt to set up trade routes between planets. Players can track friends on the galactic map and the system maps. Due to limited multiplayer aspects, Sony does not require PlayStation 4 users to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to play the game online.|$|E

25|$|Although {{promises}} {{are made}} to be kept, parties to an agreement are generally free to determine how a contract is terminated, can be terminated and remedial consequences for breach of contract, just as they can generally determine a contract's content. The courts have fashioned only residual limits on the parties' autonomy to determine how a contract terminates. The courts' default, or standard rules, which are generally alterable, are first that a contract is automatically concluded if it becomes impossible for one party to perform. Second, if one party breaches {{her side of the}} bargain in a serious way, the other party may cease his own performance. If a breach is not serious, the innocent party must continue his own obligations but may claim a remedy in court for the defective or imprecise performance he has received. Third, the principle remedy for breach of contract is compensatory damages, limited to losses <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> reasonably expect to result from a breach. This means a sum of money to put the claimant in mostly the same position as if the contract breaker had performed her obligations. In a small number of contract cases, closely analogous to property or trust obligations, a court may order restitution by the contract breaker so that any gains she has made by breaking the agreement will be stripped and given to the innocent party. Additionally where a contract's substance is for something so unique that damages would be an inadequate remedy courts may use their discretion to grant an injunction against the contract breaker doing something or, unless it is a personal service, positively order specific performance of the contract terms.|$|E

We're taking the place!" [...] Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.194), there was a rumor <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Days after the raid, one of the bar owners complained that the tipoff had never come, and that the raid was ordered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, who objected {{that there were no}} stamps on the liquor bottles, indicating the alcohol was bootlegged.|$|E

500|$|Attendees at Feynman's first seminar, {{which was}} on the {{classical}} version of the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to quantize, and Einstein said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> try to apply this method to gravity in general relativity, which Sir Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar did much later as the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler. His doctoral thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired {{by a desire to}} quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laying the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams, and was titled [...] "The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics". A key insight was that positrons behaved like electrons moving backwards in time. James Gleick wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Most of Yonkers' {{economy in}} the early 19th century {{was derived from the}} Saw Mill River. As of 1813, there was a small wharf {{slightly}} upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in. Five small mills existed along the river above the village, all with their own dams, small mill ponds, and nearby tenements for the workers. The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills. [...] Some pastures and orchards existed, but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming. (A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that [...] "the succession of boulders was so continuous <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> have stepped from Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground".) Between the rocky soil and Wells' general refusal to sell or lease most of his land, there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect {{due to the lack of}} students.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
