The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> maker and telescope pioneer Zacharias Janssen.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the second}} Heritage Classic game, held seven seasons after the original. It {{was also the first}} time the NHL held two outdoor games in one season, as it {{followed}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic in Pittsburgh. In spite of criticism that playing two such games in a season would lessen <b>the</b> <b>spectacle,</b> the Heritage Classic eclipsed all previous NHL outdoor games in sponsorship. The game's title sponsor was Tim Hortons.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> diffuse <b>spectacle</b> is more {{effective}} than <b>the</b> concentrated <b>spectacle.</b> <b>The</b> diffuse <b>spectacle</b> operates mostly through seduction, while <b>the</b> concentrated <b>spectacle</b> operates mostly through violence.

40|$|Spectacles are {{routinely}} prescribed by the ophthalmologist and dispensed by the opticians. We investigated how frequently <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> are not dispensed as prescribed {{and whether the}} frequency of inaccurate spectacles would decrease if the patients, {{at the time of}} collecting <b>spectacles,</b> ask <b>the</b> optician to verify that <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> have been dispensed accurately. We found inaccurate spectacles in about one-third of our patients and incorrect spherocylinders more frequently with an error in the spherical element and cylinder axis. These inaccuracies decreased significantly when patients while collecting <b>spectacles,</b> asked <b>the</b> optician to verify the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> dispensed. It is suggested that while prescribing <b>spectacles,</b> <b>the</b> patients should be made aware of the possibility of dispensing errors. To decrease the frequency of incorrect <b>spectacles,</b> <b>the</b> patients while collecting <b>spectacles,</b> should ask <b>the</b> optician to check whether <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> have been dispensed accurately...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} chapter {{the true nature}} of <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> is revealed. <b>The</b> wizard, it transpires, is in fact a good man, who gave <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> to Faliol to dull the visions of {{absolute}} chaos and horror which had been driving him insane. <b>The</b> <b>spectacles</b> refine <b>the</b> world they view to each object's insubstantial essence, exposing the meaninglessness and transience of everything. Faliol's visions, the wizard tells him, are given by the malevolent god Anima Mundi, which wishes to show Faliol the horror of existence.|$|R

Zone in Orlando, Florida was revealed as the location for <b>the</b> <b>spectacle.</b> TNA created a section regarding their event on their website to help promote the event. TNA released a poster featuring Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, and Tomko sometime prior to help promote the event. TNA moved Final Resolution to December {{later in the year}} and held a second event for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, McGown {{staged a}} billiards {{exhibition}} at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the 6-year-old Balukas, where she participated in <b>the</b> <b>spectacle.</b> The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on WNEW-TV's Wonderama. Later that year, Balukas, {{along with her}} younger sister Laura, appeared on CBS's popular show I've Got a Secret. None of the panelists were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spectacles</b> wetland area is {{considered}} to be the most valuable asset of Kwinana's natural environment, covering 3.7 square kilometres. It is named <b>The</b> <b>Spectacles</b> because it comprises two lakes connected by a drain, giving it the appearance of a pair of spectacles from an aerial perspective.|$|R
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of}} the ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on the arm of <b>the</b> <b>spectacles.</b> <b>The</b> sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> to <b>the</b> inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|R

In January 2016, in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey (with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century), the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see <b>the</b> <b>spectacle.</b> There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E

In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from <b>the</b> <b>spectacle.</b>|$|E

The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> of the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} <b>the</b> <b>spectacle,</b> brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E

They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives {{at the very top of}} the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming <b>the</b> <b>spectacle,</b> {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E

In the same telecast, Daniels accused Styles of trying to take his spot as the contender for the championship due to Styles having thrown in the towel for Daniels. Styles argued that he was instead looking out for Daniels' health in the storyline. The following week on the January28 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that the three would compete in a Three Way match for the title at the show.
