5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance</b> in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited {{except for some}} use of Ordnance Survey maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 {{is accompanied by a}} pair of diagrams showing how a holloway ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{final result}} was a chapel, {{complete}} with its unornamented yellow stock brick walls, a tall, eye-catching yet gracefully simple steeple, and simple botanically accurate rose windows, created a dramatic but tasteful and purposeful piece; one that epitomised its low gothic nondenominational function well, whilst establishing Abney Park as a local landmark visible from the thoroughfares of Church Street and the High Street, and from Woodberry Downs in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gueudecourt village {{lies on the}} Le Sars–Le Transloy road, {{north-east}} of Flers and north-west of Lesbœufs.

German troops passed through the village in late September 1914 during the First Battle of Albert, {{part of a series}} of reciprocal operations by the German and Franco-British armies, to advance round the northern flank of their opponent during the operations known as the Race to the Sea. The village became a backwater until 1916 when a third line of defence was dug behind the Somme front, as part of the German preparations to receive the British-French offensive being prepared on the Somme.|$|E

Now a middle-distance athlete, she was due to begin training with former Olympian Eshetu Tura, who was recommended to her by the prominent Qatar-based Somali track coach Jama Aden and the Olympic medalist Mohamed Suleiman. She was allowed to train with <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance</b> Ethiopian team once approval from the Ethiopian Olympic Committee was received. Her personal best time when first meeting with the Ethiopian team was 5 minutes for the 1500 metres; it was made clear that she would need to meet 4:20 to be competitive.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not look directly at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance,</b> observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some {{steps onto the}} beach wearing a black bathing suit and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots standing next to a cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black bathing suit to a different style white bathing suit whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black bathing suit with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself and staring into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance.</b> What becomes of the broken-hearted?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the methods that the Spanish coaches follow in order to improve the aerobic power of their <b>middle,</b> long <b>distance</b> and marathon runners. Twenty-six Spanish coaches took part in the present investigation. We investigated the intensity, running distances and frequency of the weekly training sessions that are used for the enhancement of aerobic power during the year training-cycle. Our results showed that a) in order for the aerobic power to improve, the range of heart beats appeared to be between 160 and 180 beats. min(- 1) for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distances,</b> 150 and 180 beats. min(- 1) for the long distances and 140 and 170 beats. min(- 1) for the marathon, b) the percentage of VO 2 PEAK that is used for the improvement of aerobic power ranged between 77 % and 94 % of VO 2 PEAK for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distances,</b> 72 % and 92 % of VO 2 PEAK for the long distances and 67 % and 85 % of VO 2 PEAK for the marathon, c) the running distances that were performed were between 1700 m and 3000 m for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distances,</b> 1700 m and 3100 m for the long distances and 2400 m and 3800 m for the marathon. The intensity of the distances that were per-formed ranged from 83 % to 89 % of VO 2 PEAK peak for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distances,</b> 76 % to 85 % of VO 2 PEAK for the long distances and 74 % to 84 % of VO 2 PEAK for the marathon and d) the frequency of the weekly training sessions in basic period was 23 sessions per week for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> and long <b>distances</b> and 1 - 2 sessions per week for the marathon. During the special and competitive period the sessions' frequency remained the same as in the basic period except for the marathon where the frequency of the sessions tended to be less repetitive (about 1 session per week) ...|$|R
2500|$|Of the rear, Elisabeth A.Fraser {{notes that}} [...] "he {{background}} {{cuts through the}} centre of the composition and drops inexplicably out and back from the cluster of [...] figures." [...] This dramatic arrangement breaks the picture apart into fragments, with clumps of tangled bodies, scattered glances and other details competing for the viewers attention. In <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance,</b> another mêlée of humanitarian disaster unfolds, and the background is an uneven display of sacked, burning settlements and scorched earth. Most of the Mediterranean horizon is painted with bleak earth colours, and it is punctuated only by smoke, the mane of the rearing horse {{and the head of the}} soldier.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} around 1500 the Virgin and Child often {{dominate}} the composition in Early Netherlandish paintings, with Joseph and the donkey in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance,</b> {{if they are}} visible at all. [...] In a Gerard David in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, Joseph {{is seen in the}} background gathering food by beating a chestnut tree with a long stick, a detail probably borrowed from miniatures of the Labours of the Months in the calendars of books of hours, and perhaps a northern substitute for the dates in the legends. [...] The Washington painting appears to be the earliest in a number of paintings of the subject, or using the central figures in other contexts, that were apparently produced by transfer from copies of drawings. [...] Many of these are loosely attributed to the large Bruges workshop of Adriaen Isenbrandt.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray imaging of the Bathers has {{revealed}} that some components of the composition were altered as Seurat’s work on the canvas progressed, while other components were probably not in the painting at all, as he first painted it. The two reclining figures—one {{at the front of}} the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the X-ray image to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the X-ray image at all, showing he is a late addition. His posture reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front. The skiff and the ferry boat with the tricolor, and the pointillistically applied spots at various locations in the lower mid-section of the painting, are also absent in the X-ray image. A contentious theory suggests that these elements were added by Seurat as a means of making a connection between the Bathers and A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. In spite of their remoteness in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>distance,</b> the motifs and the seated figures on the boat are present in the later painting, and the ferry boat indeed traverses the river between the Courbevoie river-bank and the île de la Grande Jatte itself. The late additions in Bathers bring for the first time a note of vitality to the serene picture in keeping with the more [...] "sociable" [...] climate of A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.|$|E
