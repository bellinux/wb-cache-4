[...] Salaethus was executed immediately, although he suggested that, in return for his life, he would have the Spartan force besieging Plataea withdrawn. [...] The assembly then turned its attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with the prisoners at Athens {{and the rest of the}} Mytileneans back on Lesbos. [...] What followed was one of the most famous debates in the history of the Athenian democracy, and one of only two occasions on which Thucydides records the content, and perhaps some of the actual words, of the opposing speeches in the assembly. [...] As such, the debate has been the subject of much scholarly analysis, aimed elucidating both the circumstances of the revolt and the internal politics of Athens at that time.|$|E

2500|$|BioShock {{director}} Ken Levine described Andrew Ryan as {{a character}} of ideals, {{in contrast to the}} game's other antagonist, Frank Fontaine, who has no ideals. Designing the encounter between the player and Ryan was a controversial decision for the developers, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the player's motive is at this point. Ryan taking his own life to prevent Jack, the protagonist, from accomplishing this, was described as the [...] "ultimate insult" [...] by Levine. The scene took a long time for the developers to finish. Levine stated that they figured out who the character of Andrew Ryan is too early, adding that they underestimated the impact that this would make. While he is saner than the opponents the players encounter before him, including a plastic surgeon who takes his ideal of beauty too far, he is as unmovable as they are, unwilling to change his ideals. When discussing how many people would get the good ending to BioShock, he commented that Ryan would not, choosing to take the easier path.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} he came to compose his account of Malthus for The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt had {{acquired}} perspective and achieved a more balanced view of his subject. He notes {{at the outset that}} [...] "Mr. Malthus ... attained a scientific reputation in questions of moral and political philosophy." [...] There is no mistaking what the man stands for: [...] "In weighing his merits we come at once <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he has done or failed to do." [...] We know immediately that we are speaking of his [...] "'Essay on Population' [...] distinct leading proposition" [...] which [...] "has changed the aspect of political economy in a decided and material point of view": the proposition [...] "that 'the population cannot go on perpetually increasing without pressing on the limits of the means of subsistence, and that a check of some kind or other must, sooner or later, be opposed to it.' This is the essence of the doctrine which Mr. Malthus has been the first to bring into general notice, and as we think, to establish beyond the fear of contradiction." ...|$|E

He wrote later: [...] "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty" [...] again and again turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it means to be a}} poet. [...] "My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk", Keats notes to Shelley. In September 1819, Keats wrote to Reynolds [...] "How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it ... I never lik'd the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday's walk that I composed upon it".

60|$|It will be {{seen from}} these facts that, as regards iron, the Chinese have allowed the Japanese to acquire a {{position}} of vantage from which they can only be ousted with great difficulty. Nevertheless, it is absolutely imperative that the Chinese should develop an {{iron and steel industry}} of their own on a large scale. If they do not, they cannot preserve their national independence, their own civilization, or any of the things that make them potentially of value to the world. It should be observed that the chief reason for which the Japanese desire Chinese iron is {{in order to be able}} to exploit and tyrannize over China. Confucius, I understand, says nothing about iron mines;[107] therefore the old-fashioned Chinese did not realize the importance of preserving them.

60|$|Closely {{associated}} with this suggestion of antiquity in Quoskh's demeanor is the opposite suggestion of perpetual youth which he carries with him. Age has no apparent effect on him whatsoever. He is as old and young as the earth itself is; he is a March day, with winter and spring in its sunset and sunrise. Who ever saw a blue heron with his jewel eye dimmed or his natural force abated? Who ever caught one sleeping, or saw him tottering weakly on his long legs, as one so often sees our common wild birds clinging feebly to a branch with their last grip? A Cape Cod sailor once told me that, far out from land, his schooner had passed a blue heron lying dead on the sea with outstretched wings. That is the only heron that I have ever heard of who was found without all his wits about him. Possibly, if Quoskh ever dies, it may suggest a solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> becomes of him.

I cannot conceive that any single proposition whatever in religion is true in the scientific sense; and yet all the while I think the religious view of the world is the most true view.

You {{are not alone in}} it. You are not lord of all you survey. Your leadership is disputed.
