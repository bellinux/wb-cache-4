5|$|Hand {{served as}} {{a federal judge in}} the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, {{including}} <b>torts,</b> contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law. His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited courtroom experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found tiresome, and patent law, which fascinated him.|$|E

Blacksmith's wife and Ely S. Parker (Blacksmith's successor as sachem of the Wolf Clan), together the administrators of Blacksmith's estate, succeeded Blacksmith as plaintiffs.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{legislature}} {{has made significant}} inroads into <b>tort</b> law, <b>tort</b> theorists have focused their attention overwhelmingly on the common law. Serious consideration has never {{been given to the}} challenges that statutory <b>tort</b> law poses for theories of <b>tort</b> law. In this article we begin to redress this omission by examining the implications of statutes for corrective justice and rights-based theories of <b>tort</b> law. Our central task is to determine whether these leading theories accurately explain <b>tort</b> law once statutory <b>tort</b> law is taken into account. As a precursor to this analysis, we consider whether statutes form part of <b>tort</b> law (some influential theorists believe or arguably believe that they do not). We contend that statutes are part of <b>tort</b> law and that the theories under examination fail to explain important aspects of statutory <b>tort</b> law. Partly because of this failure, they are not satisfactory accounts of the whole of <b>tort</b> law, which is often how they are presented by their proponents...|$|R
40|$|Leaving aside {{difficult}} to interpret doctrinal developments, such as the abrogation of traditional immunities, liability insurance has at least the following six impacts on <b>tort</b> law in action. First, for claims against all but the wealthiest individuals and organizations, liability insurance is a de facto element of <b>tort</b> liability. Second, liability insurance limits are a de facto cap on <b>tort</b> damages. Third, <b>tort</b> claims are shaped to match the available liability insurance, {{with the result that}} liability insurance policy exclusions become de facto limits on <b>tort</b> liability. Fourth, liability insurance makes lawsuits against ordinary individuals and small organizations into repeat player lawsuits on the defense side, making <b>tort</b> law in action less focused on the fault of individual defendants and more focused on managing aggregate costs. Fifth, liability insurance personnel transform complex <b>tort</b> rules into simple rules of thumb, also with the result that <b>tort</b> law in action is less concerned with the fault of individual defendants than <b>tort</b> law on the books. Sixth, negotiations over the boundaries of liability insurance coverage (which appears nowhere in <b>tort</b> law on the books) drive <b>tort</b> law in action...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} appropriate purpose of <b>tort</b> law continues to rage. Some advocate that <b>tort</b> rules should minimize accident costs {{as an instrument}} for maximizing social welfare and wealth. Others argue that <b>tort</b> rules should fairly protect the individual right to physical security. Although these two conceptions of <b>tort</b> law are fundamentally incompatible, it is a separate question whether the requirements of welfare economics can be satisfied by rights-based <b>tort</b> rules. This article identifies a class of rights-based <b>tort</b> rules that conforms to existing <b>tort</b> practice and satisfies the distributional requirements of welfare economics. These fair <b>tort</b> rules protect the individual right to physical security for reasons of individual autonomy, a justification that rules out the maximization of social welfare {{as a reason for}} compromising the right-holder’s autonomy. The <b>tort</b> right, however, does not constrain social welfare in all possible states of the world. The right only protects the autonomy of the right-holder and does not bar the right-holder from exercising her autonomy. The right-holder can exercise her autonomy to promote her welfare, eliminating any conflict between the <b>tort</b> right and the Pareto principle. In addition to being consistent with the Pareto principle, this class of rights-based <b>tort</b> rules satisfies the equity-efficiency criterion. These rights-based <b>tort</b> rules therefore satisfy the two requirements of welfare economics that are relevant for evaluating distributional rules. The substantive compatibility of rights-based <b>tort</b> rules and welfare economics is further confirmed by analyses showing that any rights-based <b>tort</b> system is likely to provide an important role for economic analysis, one that operates within the constrained space of individual welfare. As a distributional matter, there is no conflict between efficiency and fairness in <b>tort</b> law...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in <b>torts</b> class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to <b>torts</b> and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in <b>torts</b> (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E

40|$|In, 1996 {{both the}} United States House of Representatives and Senate passed {{legislation}} that, if enacted, would preempt state <b>tort</b> laws in significant ways. Why would a Congress otherwise apparently committed to vesting states with greater policymaking autonomy call for federal control of <b>tort</b> law? <b>Tort</b> policymaking {{has traditionally been}} done at the state level. One assumption underlying this distribution of power is that states are better able than the national government to fashion <b>tort</b> rules appropriate for local conditions and circumstances. In other words, states {{are thought to have}} a special competence in crafting <b>tort</b> rules responsive to local needs. Some advocates for <b>tort</b> reform at the federal level maintain, however, that states are incapable or unlikely to develop <b>tort</b> rules – especially in the realm of product liability – consistent with national economic policy. Federal <b>tort</b> reform is needed, so the argument goes, to counter pressures that exist at the state level to use <b>tort</b> law as a vehicle for redistributing wealth from nonresident defendants to resident plaintiffs. Our paper examines these two, contradictory assumptions about state competence in the realm of <b>tort</b> policymaking. First we explore the proposition that states are incompetent to formulate sensible <b>tort</b> law policy, especially in the area of product liability. Second, we employ social scientific research methodology to question whether states have special competence to formulate <b>tort</b> policy...|$|R

In Polish, as an example, the English word torte is translated into Polish as <b>tort,</b> but <b>tort</b> can be also translated as layer cake or cream cake. Birthday cake is <b>tort</b> urodzinowy and wedding cake is <b>tort</b> weselny (though the general word for cake is ciasto).

5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first Restatement of <b>Torts</b> for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the Restatement compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E

25|$|The form of {{reasoning}} used in common law {{is known as}} casuistry or case-based reasoning. The common law, as applied in civil cases (as distinct from criminal cases), was devised {{as a means of}} compensating someone for wrongful acts known as <b>torts,</b> including both intentional <b>torts</b> and <b>torts</b> caused by negligence, and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating contracts. The type of procedure practiced in common law courts is known as the adversarial system; this is also a development of the common law.|$|E
40|$|Economists {{argue that}} <b>tort</b> law {{promotes}} an efficient {{allocation of resources}} to safety, while philosophers contend that it dispenses corrective justice. Despite the divide, the leading <b>tort</b> theories share something in common: they are grounded in an unduly narrow view of <b>tort.</b> Both economists and philosophers confuse the institution of <b>tort</b> law with the rules that are distinctive of it. They offer theories of <b>tort</b> 2 ̆ 7 s substantive rules, {{but for the most}} part ignore the procedures by which those rules are implemented. As a consequence, both miss and misconstrue much about <b>tort</b> law. The problem is particularly acute for economists. They analyze the impact of <b>tort</b> 2 ̆ 7 s substantive rules on accident and accident avoidance costs. Yet, the institution of <b>tort</b> law generates many other costs and benefits for society, and those costs and benefits affect the optimal arrangement of <b>tort</b> 2 ̆ 7 s rules. The fact that economists have not factored these additional costs and benefits into their analyses calls into question their descriptive and normative claims about <b>tort.</b> Corrective justice theory is not in as much trouble as the economic approach, but it is troubled still. Philosophers 2 ̆ 7 neglect of the procedural dimension of <b>tort</b> has caused them to overlook ways that <b>tort</b> does justice between wrongdoers and victims. And it has led them to make misleading claims about the nature of both corrective justice and <b>tort</b> law. This Article draws out the trouble with <b>tort</b> theory through a thought experiment, starring Harry Potter. Potter 2 ̆ 7 s magic helps to highlight the features of <b>tort</b> that the leading theories overlook Once they are in view, the Article considers the ways in which the omissions cast doubt on the claims those theories make, investigates ways they might improved, and offers several observations about the choice between them...|$|R

Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into libel and slander), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tort</b> reform may {{not affect}} all {{segments}} of society equally. Studies have shown that many <b>tort</b> reforms disproportionately reduce compensation to women, children, the elderly, disadvantaged minorities, and less affluent people. This study goes beyond <b>tort</b> reforms disproportionate effect on compensation, to explore whether <b>tort</b> reform also has a disproportionate effect on accidental death rates. We explain that, theoretically, <b>tort</b> reforms care-level effects and activity-level effects may disproportionately impact the accident rates of different groups. Using the most accurate, comprehensive data on medical malpractice <b>tort</b> reforms and state-level data from 1980 - 2000, we examine empirically whether <b>tort</b> reforms indeed have such a disproportionate effect. The results from our empirical analysis are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We find {{that the impact of}} <b>tort</b> reform varies substantially among demographic groups. When we consider the net effect of all the reforms in our study together, our results suggest that women, children, and the elderly do not enjoy <b>tort</b> reforms benefits as much as men and middle-aged people. In fact, they might even be harmed by reform. ...|$|R
