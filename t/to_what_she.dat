5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country {{life in which}} each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E

Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, {{she believed in}} progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Jenner's gender {{transition}} {{is the subject}} of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers. Jenner is an executive producer of the show. The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends.

5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> can hold.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

5000|$|The James Brown song [...] "Hot Pants (<b>She</b> Got <b>to</b> Use <b>What</b> <b>She</b> Got <b>to</b> Get <b>What</b> <b>She</b> Wants)", {{released}} in August 1971, was, {{according to his}} trombonist Fred Wesley, inspired {{by the sight of}} women of all colours wearing hotpants {{in a wide range of}} materials in the Black and White Club, Brussels.|$|R

25|$|In July 2011, Nina Paley made {{a protest}} video {{regarding}} the film's deletion from YouTube in Germany due <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> regards as fraudulent take-down notice {{under the aegis}} of GEMA, Germany's major music and performance rights organization, but which may be an instance of a larger on-going conflict regarding copyright and royalties between YouTube and GEMA.|$|E
25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s Valette {{worked as}} an unpaid {{volunteer}} labor inspector in the Paris region.

She attended the 1891 international congress in Brussels as a confirmed Guesdist.|$|E

Benjamin has also been involved with the anti-war organization United for Peace and Justice.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact}} that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought of her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However {{she seemed to be}} unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1429 during the Hundred Years' War, in {{obedience}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said was the command of God, Joan of Arc inspired the Dauphin's armies {{in a series of}} stunning military victories which lifted the siege of Orleans and destroyed {{a large percentage of the}} remaining English forces at the battle of Patay. A series of military setbacks eventually led to her capture in the Spring of 1430 by the Burgundians, who were allied with the English. They delivered her to them for 10,000 livres. In December of that same year she was transferred to Rouen, the military headquarters and administrative capital in France of King Henry VI of England, and placed on trial for heresy before a Church court headed by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, a supporter of the English.|$|E
