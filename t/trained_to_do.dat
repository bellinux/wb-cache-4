5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and the animal {{must be able to}} do this without human assistance: it must also be shown that {{the birds are}} able to do this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E

While other agencies may be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> similar, the very important distinction is {{the staff of}} NSW Ambulance also provide life saving medical intervention {{to those who are}} lost, trapped or in a precarious situation. This is especially important as Fire and Rescue NSW personnel are generally Basic Life Support (BLS) trained hence not being trained to provide acceptable levels of professional clinical care.|$|E
25|$|However, Sperlich {{notes that}} Chomsky has been vilified by {{corporate}} interests, {{particularly in the}} mainstream press. University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, {{regardless of whether they}} have been academically <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so or not.|$|E

25|$|Ogawa and his wingman {{had just}} swept down on Bunker Hill {{so quickly that}} her gunners {{barely had time to}} respond. Ogawa's wingman {{released}} a 550-lb bomb which smashed through the flight deck and out the side, exploding just above the water. The aircraft crashed into the flight deck and skidded over the side, destroying nearly all of the 34 fully armed and fueled planes parked on the flight deck. At the same time, Ogawa was completing his dive with his Zero through the AA fire, aiming for the flight deck near the bridge of the ship to cause the most damage, as kamikaze pilots were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> At nearly a vertical dive, Ogawa dropped his 550-lb bomb just before impact with the flight deck, crashing near the island at about 10:05 hours.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by {{packs of}} dogs to be shot. This {{activity}} is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, {{decided that this}} activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least {{because it is more}} difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place. On Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the current Conservative Government are proposing Amendments to the Act, after realising they had only a slender chance of Repealing it. The amendments will be voted upon by a free vote, after just one hour's debate in the House of Commons. One of the key amendments is the flushing out of foxes, for them to be shot to death. Whilst this might sometimes prevent the foxes from being attacked by hounds, it is conceivable such attacks will happen, especially with dogs having previously been <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

500|$|Ward’s accomplishments {{were not}} limited to the high jump. An Associated Press article in 1932 noted: “His {{specialty}} is the high jump for which he has a mark of 6 feet 7½ inches. He can run the high hurdles and the low hurdles. He has broad jumped 22 feet without training in that event. He put the 16-pound shot over 43 feet without prior experience, and it believed he might be developed into a world champion weight man. He unquestionably could be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the springs. He is only 19. Ward has an ideal build for a track man, six feet, one inch tall, 185 pounds of well-distributed weight, good legs, natural co-ordination.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E

500|$|Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society {{campaign}} against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign {{to those found in}} the wild. Captive life is also stressful due the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to [...] in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Dolphins are often <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> several anthropomorphic behaviors, including waving and kissing—behaviors wild dolphins would rarely do.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ability to}} perform an ambling gait is usually an {{inherited}} trait. [...] In 2012, a DNA study found that horses from several gaited and harness racing breeds carried a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which controls the spinal neurological circuits related to limb movement and motion. In 2014, that mutation was found to originate in a single ancestor to all gaited horses. [...] Some gaited breeds naturally perform these gaits from birth, others need to be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them. [...] Some breeds have individuals who can both amble and perform a trot or pace. [...] In the Standardbred breed, the DMRT3 gene was also found in trotting horses, suggesting that it inhibits the ability to transition into a canter or gallop.|$|E
