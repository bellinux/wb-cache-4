25|$|Although Piper had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> {{anonymous}} {{because of}} the sexual assault, she chose to waive her anonymity, {{in an attempt to}} increase public awareness of the situation for burn victims, and also the treatment they go through. Piper also took part in a documentary about her experience, Katie: My Beautiful Face, which was aired by Channel 4 on 29 October 2009, and, according to figures from Attentional, gained over 3.3million viewers. The programme was repeated three times during 2009: once on Christmas Day, 2009 on Channel 4 (to tie in with Piper giving the Alternative Christmas Message) and twice on More4 (in early November and late December, each a few days after a C4 screening). There was further More4 screening on 13 February 2011 ahead of the release of Piper's book and follow-up series. The film was broadcast to viewers in Wales on the now-defunct analogue service of S4C on 15 November 2009 at midnight: digital viewers in Wales had access to the Channel 4 and More4 broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company {{felt that the}} notion of a quick trip would be destroyed by a long drive to the new airport. Prior to the opening of DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E

500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent {{as part of}} their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Remaining silent is optional—they may speak or be silent as they wish. The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners {{to make sure that the}} suspect is aware they have that right prior to questioning, in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right (and would have relied upon it had they been aware). Miranda v. Arizona [...] and related cases contemplate that a suspect might invoke their rights (make clear they wish to rely on them), waive their rights (make clear they do not wish to rely on them), or do neither of these. A number of cases such as the present one, refine Miranda by addressing when and at what point a suspect, who is aware that they have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent, is said to have begun to rely on that right, as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it.|$|E
500|$|At {{least one}} scholar {{has argued that}} Thompkins {{effectively}} gutted Miranda. In <b>The</b> <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Remain</b> Silent, Charles Weisselberg argues that [...] "the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v.

[...] and that [...] "But in Thompkins, neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied waiver after lengthy questioning. Thompkins persevered for almost three hours before succumbing to his interrogators. In finding a waiver on these facts, Thomphins gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids." ...|$|E
500|$|The case of North Carolina v.

The court held that where a Miranda warning had been given and was understood by the accused, an accused's uncoerced statement established an implied waiver of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent. Thompkins answer to the police question, having understood but not chosen to invoke his rights, was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. Further corroboration was that he had sporadically made other comments as well.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2010, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Berghuis v. Thompkins that a {{criminal}} suspect must now invoke <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent unambiguously.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver.
