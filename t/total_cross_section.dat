The outlook would be more favorable if the plasma could reabsorb the radiation. Absorption occurs primarily via Thomson scattering on the electrons, which has a <b>total</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of σT = 6.65×10−29 m². In a 50–50 D-T mixture this corresponds {{to a range of}} 6.3 g/cm²./σT = 2.5×(1.67×10−24 g)/(6.65×10−25 cm²) = 6.28 g/cm² This is considerably higher than the Lawson criterion of ρR > 1g/cm², which is already difficult to attain, but might be achievable in inertial confinement systems.|$|E

Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the <b>total</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers.|$|E
