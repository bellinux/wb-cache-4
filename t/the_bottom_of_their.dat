5|$|Cadet George Washington Street was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported black and light blue striped jerseys and caps, with white pants and blue socks. The Naval Academy wore maroon socks, caps, and belts, with white pants and jerseys. Both teams also nailed strips of leather to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{young people in}} some {{countries}} would tightly fold or roll <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pants.

2500|$|The Blackfoot Confederacies {{reside in}} the Great Plains of Montana and Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The name [...] "Blackfoot" [...] came from the colour of the peoples' leather footwear, known as moccasins. They had dyed or painted <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> moccasins black. One account claimed that the Blackfoot Confederacies walked through the ashes of prairie fires, which in turn {{coloured}} <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> moccasins black. They had migrated onto the Great Plains and west from the upper Northeastern area. The Blackfoot started as Woodland Nations but {{as they made their}} way over to the Plains, they adapted to new ways of life and became accustomed to the land. They established themselves as Plains Indians in the late 18th century, earning themselves the name [...] "The Lords of the Plains".|$|R

5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown {{on the back and}} whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, {{football}} {{began as}} a sport at the Academy. Student William John Maxwell organized a team made up of fellow students, without any support of faculty. He organized a game with the Baltimore Athletic Club, which ended in a scoreless tie. Maxwell graduated in 1880, and the football program ended in his absence. In 1882, Carter re-initiated and organized a new football team. He took a position as the team coach, the first in school history; he also functioned as a back when playing. He scheduled a single game for the season, which was played on Thanksgiving Day against the Baltimore-based Clifton Football Club. The Clifton team {{was made up of}} players from Johns Hopkins University, who were unable to play for their school due to the administrator's negative views towards the sport. Carter designed a maroon and white uniform for the squad and a strip of leather which was nailed to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shoes to prevent slipping.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck {{to comply with the}} formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{tongues of}} long-beaked {{echidnas}} have sharp, tiny spines {{that help them}} capture their prey. They have no teeth, and break down their food by grinding it between <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mouths and their tongues.

5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse can be {{distinguished}} from other large flies by two easily observed features. Tsetse fold their wings completely when they are resting so that one wing rests directly {{on top of the}} other over their abdomens. Tsetse also have a long proboscis, which extends directly forward and is attached by a distinct bulb to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads.|$|E

25|$|The system {{consists}} of a pyramid of leagues, bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation. A certain number {{of the most successful}} clubs in each league can rise to a higher league, whilst those that finish at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> league can find themselves sinking down a level. In addition to sporting performance, promotion is usually contingent on meeting criteria set by the higher league, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances.|$|E
25|$|His third {{marriage}} was to Nerine Kidd Shatner, from 1997 {{until her death}} in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10p.m. to discover Nerine's body at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> backyard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An autopsy detected alcohol and Valium (diazepam) in her blood, but the coroner ruled {{the cause of death}} as an accidental drowning. The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed.|$|E
25|$|A trip to Slovakia was {{in store}} for GB in Pool B in 1996. GB started {{positively}} with a much better account against Denmark who they had been routed against the previous year falling only to a 5–0 defeat. Unfortunately any hopes of a great comeback were dashed in their second game against the Danes who GB had previously done well against, collapsing to a 7–1 defeat. That scoreline was repeated in the final group round game against the Dutch to leave GB adrift at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> group.|$|E

Only one of the Niitsitapi tribes are called Blackfoot or Siksika. The name is said to have come from the color of the peoples' moccasins, made of leather. They had {{typically}} dyed or painted the soles <b>of</b> <b>their</b> moccasins black. One legendary story claimed that the Siksika walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> moccasins black.|$|R

25|$|The 2005 ICC Trophy {{represented}} {{a chance for}} the USA to re-establish themselves on the world stage and qualify for the 2007 World Cup. A poor showing saw them finish at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> group, with four losses and a match abandoned due to rain from their five group fixtures. This failure robbed the USA of the prize of full One Day International status on offer to the World Cup qualifiers. This failure was compounded on August 9, 2005 when the ICC expelled the USA from the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 Detroit Lions {{season was}} the franchise’s eightieth season {{overall in the}} National Football League. It was the first season with the Lions for new head coach Jim Schwartz, {{and most of his}} new {{coaching}} staff. The Lions also introduced slightly new uniforms and logos. The Lions spent the whole season at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> division and finished at 2–14, the second-worst record during the 2009 season. Pro Football Reference has argued that, owing to a weaker programme featuring the NFC West and AFC North vis-à-vis their 2008 schedule against surprisingly strong NFC South and AFC South divisions, the 2009 Lions were actually a weaker team than the 0–16 2008 Lions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} have investigated {{to what extent}} these behavioral economic lab experiments on social preferences can be generalized to behavior in the field. In a 2011 study, Fehr and Leibbrandt {{examined the relationship between}} contributions in public goods games to participation in public goods in the community of shrimpers in Brazil. These shrimpers cut a hole in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fishing bucket in order to allow immature shrimp to escape, thereby investing in the public good of the shared shrimp population. The size of the hole {{can be seen as the}} degree to which participants cooperate, as larger holes allow more shrimp to escape. Controlling for a number of other possible influences, Fehr and Leibbrandt demonstrated a positive relationship between hole size and contributions in the public goods game experiment.|$|E
6000|$|In one cart stood a {{blind man}} in the uniform of the Salvation Army, gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, [...] "Eternity! Eternity!" [...] His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some {{of the people who}} crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay {{prostrate}} in <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> conveyances. <b>The</b> horses' bits were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.|$|R

25|$|Although many kiosks {{have been}} fitted with {{replacement}} backs over recent years, unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> back panel. The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark {{can be found at}} about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel. These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, the year of manufacture is also included. The more recently erected non-BT K6 kiosks (generally painted black) are for the most part new castings, sourced from new manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|If Japanese {{rule was}} harsh when {{contrasted with the}} more paternalistic Australian approach, it was, {{at least for the}} native Nauruans, not as brutal as in other areas {{controlled}} by the Japanese. The occupiers tried to seduce the natives using propaganda, educational programs, and entertainment. They opened a Japanese school, a language which many Nauruans learned during the war, and hired native dancers for celebrations they organized, which brought the Nauruans extra money. They opted not to interfere with the work of the two European priests, who had great influence among the population, and allowed religious services to take place. They also hired some of the employees of the former administration. However, the Japanese were particularly harsh with the Chinese, who were at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> perceived racial hierarchy. They were underfed and beaten more often and more brutally than the other inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|After the {{expansion}} of the previous CONCACAF Champions' Cup into the Champions League in 2008, the Caribbean gained two additional qualification positions. Joe Public, after finishing runners-up in the 2007 Caribbean Club Championship, became the first club to represent the TT Pro League in the Champions League. On 26 August 2008, the Eastern Lions stunned the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer in the preliminary round following a 2–1 win in front of a crowd of 2,100 in Marvin Lee Stadium, before defeating the American club 4–0 in the return match to advance to the group stage. With the result, Joe Public became the first Caribbean club to defeat a team from the United States in a CONCACAF club competition. In the group stage, Joe Public were drawn with Atlante, Olimpia, and Montreal Impact and struggled to obtain positive results. The Eastern Lions finished with a disappointing one win from six to finish at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> group. However, the club's lone win came in Cancún against eventual Champions League winners Atlante, marking the first time a Trinidadian club had defeated a team from the Mexican Primera División.|$|E

50|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parade uniforms, most regiments of {{the modern}} Indian and Pakistani armies wear long white spats into which {{soldiers}} tuck <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> trousers.

In the Finnish Navy, spats are part of the winter uniform; and the United States Navy Honor Guard and Rifle Guard wear them while performing ceremonies. Spats are also still used as a traditional accessory in many marching band and drum and bugle corps uniforms in the United States.|$|R
25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> necks, backs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> thighs and <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tails.|$|R
