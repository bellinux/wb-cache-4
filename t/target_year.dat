5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments {{proved to be a}} bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the <b>target</b> <b>year</b> from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014. Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.|$|E
25|$|During December 1994 Max Basher {{announced}} that Port Adelaide {{had won the}} tender for the second South Australian AFL licence. However a licence did not guarantee entry and although a <b>target</b> <b>year</b> of 1996 was set, this was reliant upon an existing AFL club folding or merging with another. In 1996, the cash-strapped Fitzroy announced it would merge with the Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions.

25|$|Traffic {{forecasts}} {{from the}} early 1990s predicted a traffic load in the north-south direction for 2010 {{that could not be}} met on the existing lines. The operating concept for this <b>target</b> <b>year</b> envisaged 108trains on the new line each day and in each direction, 24 passenger trains and 84 freight trains. For this purpose an Interregio service (Karlsruhe–Stuttgart–Nuremberg–Erfurt–Leipzig) would run at two-hour intervals and an Intercity/ICE service (Munich–Erfurt–Berlin) would run hourly over the new line; the old line (Großheringen–Saalfeld railway and Franconian Forest Railway) would be operated as an Interregio service. The Interregio trains of the new line would run via Coburg and Ilmenau and the IC/ICE services would run between Bamberg and Erfurt (although some services would stop during the day in Coburg). The IR journey would take 25minutes from Ilmenau to Bamberg and about 20 minutes to Erfurt.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 December {{after a day}} of frantic {{negotiations}} between heads of state, it was announced that a [...] "meaningful agreement" [...] had been reached between on one hand the United States and on the other, in a united position as the BASIC countries (China, South Africa, India, and Brazil). An unnamed US government official was reported as saying that the deal was a [...] "historic step forward" [...] but was not enough to prevent dangerous climate change in the future. However, the BBC's environment correspondent said: [...] "While the White House was announcing the agreement, many other – perhaps most other – delegations had not even seen it. A comment from a UK official suggested the text was not yet final and the Bolivian delegation has already complained about the way it was reached – 'anti-democratic, anti-transparent and unacceptable'. With no firm target for limiting the global temperature rise, no commitment to a legal treaty and no <b>target</b> <b>year</b> for peaking emissions, countries most vulnerable to climate impacts have not got the deal they wanted." [...] The use of [...] "meaningful" [...] in the announcement was viewed as being political spin by an editorial in The Guardian.|$|E

[...] The college {{followed}} {{through with a}} carbon neutrality plan released in 2009, with 2020 as the <b>target</b> <b>year</b> for carbon neutrality. [...] According to the plan, general improvements to Maine's electricity grid will account for 7% of carbon reductions, commuting improvements will account for 1%, and the purchase of renewable energy credits will account for 41%. [...] The college intends to reduce its own carbon emissions 28% by 2020, leaving the remaining 23% for new technologies and more renewable energy credits. The plan includes {{the construction of a}} solar thermal system, part of the [...] "Thorne Solar Hot Water Project"; cogeneration in the central heating plant (for which Bowdoin received $400,000 in federal grants); lighting upgrades to all campus buildings; and modern monitoring systems of energy usage on campus. In 2017 the College was on track to meet the 28% own source reduction target and efforts have continued in the areas of energy conservation, efficiency upgrades and transitioning to lower carbon fuel sources. Bowdoin's facilities are heated by an on-campus heating plant which burns natural gas. In February 2013, the college announced that 1.4% of its endowment is invested in the fossil fuel industry. [...] The disclosure was in response to students' calls to divest these holdings.|$|E
