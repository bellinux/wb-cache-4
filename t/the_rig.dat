5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can take hold. Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before they can take off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain with him on <b>the</b> <b>rig,</b> but Hansen is able to fight him off and kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> explodes below them.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{receives}} Doggett and Mulder's message, {{and tells}} them that Kersh has broken the quarantine. Mulder destroys the platform's radio {{so that the}} black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers stop their attack and begin to sabotage <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b> Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and jump off <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rig</b> {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. <b>The</b> <b>rig</b> also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen. Separate footage of <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E

5|$|Advanced systems {{played a}} key role in the rig's operation, from {{pressure}} and drill monitoring technology, to automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> that month.|$|E

5|$|Other {{additions}} include <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> and the Anti-Tank; <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> is {{a modified}} version of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), {{concentration and}} bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda. Nasadiya Sukta of <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda suggests {{the presence of an}} early contemplative tradition.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks <b>the</b> <b>rig,</b> stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{specialized}} types of service rigs: the carrier, the pumptruck, the doghouse, a 5-ton equipment truck and several crew vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>rigs</b> usually travel in a convoy, {{because all of}} <b>the</b> component <b>rigs</b> are needed for proper oil well servicing. The crew use the equipment on <b>the</b> <b>rigs</b> to provide a variety of services, including completions, work-overs, abandonment's, well maintenance, high-pressure and critical sour-well work and re-entry preparation.|$|R
25|$|As Twenty One's emcee and co-producer, Jack Barry did not {{directly}} <b>rig</b> <b>the</b> shows himself (even quiz-show scandal investigator Joseph Stone questioned his involvement, and Herb Stempel has said in interviews that he believes Enright hid <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> from Barry until it was exposed), yet he admitted in interviews given in the 1970s and 1980s his role in covering up <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> for Enright.|$|R
5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they must go to the radio room and contact her father. They contact <b>the</b> <b>rig,</b> but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b> Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E
5|$|New {{properties}} {{have also}} been introduced, including temporary properties which are constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> unit (formerly known as the APC). Temporary properties cannot build new units like other properties can, but can only be used as stationary resupply bases providing some defensive cover for units, and can be captured. Each Rig unit can construct one of two temporary properties, the Temporary Port and Temporary Airport. Additionally, the new Radar property has been added; when captured it clears a five-tile radius of Fog of War.|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of <b>the</b> <b>rig,</b> a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E

5|$|Bond goes to San Francisco {{where he}} learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin {{could be the}} product of medical {{experimentation}} with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician, Dr. Carl Mortner. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording Zorin's conversation. Ivanova's partner Klolktoff is captured and killed while trying to place limpet mines on <b>the</b> <b>rig,</b> but Ivanova and Bond escape. They go to her place where Bond is able to steal the recording. Bond tracks down the woman that Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to purchase her family's oil business.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still recite <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda at {{religious}} ceremonies, {{prayers and}} other occasions. These ceremonies include birth, wedding, initiation ceremonies, {{as well as}} death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include Vastushanti which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house, Satyanarayana Puja, originating in Bengal in the 19th century, is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking {{the name of the}} family's gotra and the kula daivat are important aspects of these ceremonies. Like most other Hindu communities, Deshasthas have a shrine called a devaghar in their house with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities. Ritual reading of religious texts called pothi is also popular.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
