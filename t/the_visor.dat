5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. <b>The</b> <b>visor</b> portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. <b>The</b> <b>visor</b> was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, Prost used {{variants}} of his helmet design, in 2007 {{he used his}} original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe trepassing <b>the</b> <b>visor,</b> designed by kaos design.|$|E
50|$|In one {{suggested}} protocol, chimpanzees {{are given}} first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored <b>visors.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>visors</b> is transparent {{whereas the other}} is not. <b>The</b> <b>visors</b> themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are {{given the opportunity to}} use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing <b>the</b> transparent <b>visor</b> and <b>the</b> other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing <b>the</b> transparent <b>visor.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{helmet and}} visor were cast from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. <b>The</b> <b>visor</b> would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix formula {{was changed}} again in 1938, abandoning the {{previous}} system of weight restrictions and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz' new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang {{to make it}} a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race, despite losing <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by tyres of the many lapped cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. <b>The</b> <b>visors</b> allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. <b>The</b> <b>visors</b> also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.|$|R

5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and visor buried together some 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. <b>The</b> <b>visor</b> was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E

His sons Leo and Greg inherited his helmet design, but Leo's helmet has the red chin area and the white part that envelops <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> (not counting the top) is red with white outline, while Greg's helmet has the blue chin area and the white area that envelopes <b>the</b> <b>visor</b> is blue with white outline.|$|E

25|$|Athena {{additionally}} wears a helmet, {{which also}} helps to date the statue. This is because Athena wears a Corinthian helmet, which in fourth century B.C became very popular, {{as opposed to an}} Attic helmet where she is shown wearing in other sculptures.

25|$|Batches 4 and 5 {{were better}} built, {{eliminating}} the recurrent {{problems in the}} powerplant, and are still in service, after having been refitted {{at the end of}} the 1990s. The second series started with Batch 6, with an added climate control system in the right rear of the turret. Batch 7 introduced a transmission system to the command vehicle, and a data system giving instantaneous vision of the state of all battle tanks and acquired targets. It also incorporated minor improvements in <b>the</b> <b>visor.</b> Batch 8 was a modernisation of the electronic system, and Batch 9 replaced the thermal imaging ATHOS by a SAGEM Iris with better resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} flimsy mesh visor, with imperfect {{coverage of}} the face, is considered acceptable because the chips produced by well-maintained chainsaws are of relatively uniform size and speed.
