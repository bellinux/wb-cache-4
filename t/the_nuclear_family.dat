5|$|In {{the colonial}} United States <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> {{was the most}} common family form. Typical {{families}} consisted of five or more children initially; because of high infant mortality rates, only a few children survived adolescence. Colonial families existed to serve six main functions: self-sufficient business, school, vocational institute, church, house of correction, and welfare institution.|$|E

40|$|Many {{university}} students complaining on {{not being able}} to manage their time well, when to begin and to do something, so, time which should be useful is wasted useless. Procrastination in beginning or finishing tasks faced, lateness in doing the tasks, time gap between plans and actual performance, doing other more pleasant activities than doing the tasks that must be done are aspects of academic procrastination. One of external factors influencing the {{university students}} in doing the academic procrastination is <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family’s</b> support. Every kind of family’s support has aspects such as being informative, emotional care, instrumental help and assessment help. The objective of this research was to know the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family’s</b> support and <b>the</b> academic procrastination in the university students. This research was conducted at psychology faculty of Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta with subjects were the students as many as 231 people determined by using the technique of non-probability purposive sampling. The measurement instruments used were the scale of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family’s</b> support and <b>the</b> scale of the academic procrastination.

5|$|The {{extended}} family consists of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In some circumstances, the {{extended family}} comes to live either with or {{in place of a}} member of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family.</b> An example includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old age.

5|$|The {{traditional}} family {{structure in the}} United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest {{stripped}} away {{most of the}} defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E

25|$|Historian Lawrence Stone {{identifies}} {{three major}} types of family structure: in about 1450-1630, the open lineage family dominated.

5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon {{the civil service}} system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the pre-industrial family is now believed {{to be similar to}} modern types of family. Many sociologists used to believe that <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> was the product of industrialization, but evidence highlighted by historian Peter Laslett suggests that the causality is reversed and that industrialization was so effective in North-western Europe specifically because the pre-existence of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> fostered its development.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{there were}} three aims to this study. The first aim was to explore {{the extent to which}} the war in former Yugoslavia has been subject of {{communication}} in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> of 19 former Bosnian refugees in the Netherlands (range 18 to 31 years). The second aim was to gain knowledge about social functioning of these former refugees. The third aim was to investigate whether there was a relationship between communication in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> and <b>the</b> social functioning of the participants. Method: in order to answer these explorative questions both quantitative and qualitative methods have been used. Communication in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> has been assessed using the Interfamiliaire Communicatielijst over Oorlog en Migratie (ICOM), an instrument that has been developed for usage in this research project. Social functioning has been assessed by the Schaal voor Interpersoonlijk Gedrag (SIG). All research questions have been subject of discussion in two focus groups. Results: the participants valued the ways of talking about the war and the subsequent flights to the Netherlands in their <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> as being quite open, informative and emotionally expressive. Most participants seem to be leading quite fulfilling lives and are pretty well adjusted to the Dutch society. Striking are the expressive communication skills in assertive social situations of the participants and the fear of showing insecurities, as measured by the SIG. A relationship between communication and the amount of experienced tension within assertive social situations was found. The relationship between communication and the frequency of assertive social interaction is not clear. Conclusion: the refugees that participated in this study were highly educated, well functioning and well adjusted, with no apparent pathology. Results have been interpreted in the light of the clinical samples that have been mostly used in research concerning this subject. Explanations concern cultural predispositions, roll changes in the new society and post-war psychological adaptation processes. The relatively small sample (N= 19) and the rather broad definition of the term social functioning may have accounted for some of the effects...|$|R
