5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would want to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E

500|$|Rumors of {{a multimillion-dollar}} bidding war over Jackson's {{recording}} contract began to circulate in spring 1991. Jet magazine reported: [...] "A recording company has offered {{in excess of}} $50 million to sign superstar Janet Jackson to a recording contract, making the 24-year-old singer/songwriter/dancer/actress the key player {{in one of the}} hottest bidding wars among today's major record companies." [...] Reports indicated that Capitol, Virgin and Atlantic were all bidding for Jackson's contract, as her ties to A would soon expire; by March, she had signed with Virgin. The New York Times declared [...] "Janet Jackson has signed what {{is believed to be the}} most lucrative contract in the history of recording. The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and actress signed an exclusive contract with Virgin Records it was announced yesterday." [...] Her new contract guaranteed a twenty-two percent royalty payment, in addition to her then-historic signing bonus. Chuck Philips of the Los Angeles Times reported that it had been the largest bidding war in recent memory and that [...] "ne reason the bidding was so heavy, various industry observers have noted, was that Jackson-at just 24-is still a relatively fresh face on the pop scene and that her dance-pop style is ideal for today's pop/video climate." [...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist and we expect her growth to be enormous." [...] Chairman Richard Branson spoke with Jackson privately to seal the deal. He commented: [...] "A Rembrandt rarely becomes available... When it does, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are determined to get it. I was determined." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E
