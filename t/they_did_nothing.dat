5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{general who}} won the last civil war of the Roman Republic, Gaius Octavian, became {{the master of the}} state. In the years after 30 BC, Octavian set out to reform the Roman constitution, and to found the Principate. The {{ultimate}} consequence of these reforms was the abolition of the republic, and the founding of the Roman Empire. Octavian was given the honorific Augustus ("venerable") by the Roman Senate, and became known to history by this name, and as the first Roman Emperor. Octavian's reforms did not, at the time, seem drastic, since <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> more than reorganize the constitution. The reorganization was revolutionary, however, because the ultimate result was that Octavian ended up with control over the entire constitution, which itself set the stage for outright monarchy. When Diocletian became Roman Emperor in 284, the Principate was abolished, and a new system, the Dominate, was established. This system survived until the ultimate fall of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 1453.|$|E

25|$|At a Ullico {{board meeting}} on March 28, Georgine {{proposed}} returning his profits to the company. But other board members argued this would pressure {{them to return}} their profits, too—something they {{did not wish to}} do. The scandal was causing a split in the AFL-CIO's member unions. Sweeney and some unions argued that surrendering profits {{was the only way to}} restore confidence in the labor movement. But other unions, led by Martin Maddaloni, president of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the plumbers' union), said <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> that directors in other companies had not also done. Meanwhile, an aggravated Thompson issued a public statement accusing Ullico and its legal counsel of making defamatory statements about him and his inquiry and misrepresenting the report's findings.|$|E

25|$|On 19/20 September, {{an armed}} revolt by Montagnards {{serving in the}} armed forces took place. The {{indigenous}} paramilitaries took control of four military camps in Darlac Province, killing 70 ARVN troops of Vietnamese ethnicity, and then taking a number of others and their US advisers hostage. However, the Americans eventually convinced the Montagnards to stop, after Khánh made concessions. On 20 September, the Vietnamese Confederation of Labor and their 300,000 members staged a general strike for two days, causing electricity in the cities to be cut for two days. This prompted Khánh to make concessions to laborers. This was followed by other protests and riots in some cities, the largest being in the southern coastal town of Quy Nhơn where the public service stopped functioning for a short period. In some areas of I Corps, the commanders were not disturbed by the unrest so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to stop them.|$|E
500|$|The Burning of Norfolk was an {{incident}} that occurred on January 1, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. [...] British Royal Navy ships in the harbor of Norfolk, Virginia began shelling the town, and landing parties came ashore to burn specific properties.

On 25 January 1919 she was listed by the Directorate of Ukraine as planned to be completed and included into the navy list by 1920. On 27 January 1919 she was mentioned at Directorate Navy Ministry order at the list for renaming from 1920 [...] – into Soborna Ukraina (: Union of Ukraine). However none of the short-lived Directorate orders were actually implemented. She remained at Nikolayev throughout the Russian Civil War, of no use to either side. The victorious Soviets finally inspected her in 1923 {{to see if she}} was worth completing. Her dilapidated state and obsolescent design caused them to conclude that it was not worth doing and she should be sold for scrap. Efforts were made to sell the hull abroad to raise hard currency, but when these came to nought she was towed to Sevastopol on 28 June 1927 to begin dismantling.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the lower}} price console's {{positioning}} as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega {{had a difficult}} time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. [...] Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. [...] Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was [...] "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system. [...] Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. [...] According to Bayless, [...] "games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. [...] Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. [...] By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to show off what the hardware was capable of." ...|$|E

Vietnamese historians were ridiculing and mocking men for the fact that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> while [...] "mere girls", whom they viewed with revulsion, took up the banner of revolt-the Vietnamese poem which talked about the revolt of the Trung Sisters while the men did nothing was not intended to praise women nor view war as women's work as it has been wrongly interpreted.|$|E
2500|$|Easton {{reported}} that the drain was now nearly useless, and that £10,000 {{would be needed to}} put it back into good order. In 1829, he published a proposal to improve the drain so that it would be navigable from Dunball to Yeovil. Drainage required the water levels to be lower, but navigation required them to be higher, and so the scheme came to nothing. The Commissioners scoured the drain, but no real progress was made. In 1842, another report was commissioned, from a Mr. Glyn. His two alternatives were to lower the clyse at Dunball by , and to convert {{the lower part of the}} channel into a reservoir. Steam engines would be used to pump water into it, and it would empty by gravity at low tide. The Commissioners were unsure whether their powers allowed them to start such work, so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b> In 1844, with the clyse doors in imminent danger of collapse, they paid for the cill to be lowered by [...] and fitted new doors, but the moors still flooded during most winters.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was general}} {{surprise}} when, in an incident {{known as the}} Arms Crisis, Haughey, along with Blaney, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations {{of the use of}} the funds to import arms for use by the IRA. The Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice Micheál Ó Móráin and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made opposition leader Liam Cosgrave aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the Dáil next day if he didn't act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from cabinet. Both men refused, saying <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to terminate their appointments as members of the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while Micheál Ó Móráin was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a former Flemish National Socialist and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. After trial all the accused were acquitted but many refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey's political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna Fáil but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches – the wilderness years – building support within the grassroots of the party, during this time he remained loyal to the party and served the leader but after the debacle of the [...] "arms crises" [...] neither man trusted the other.|$|E
