The system consists of two experimental chambers and other components such as tritium storage-supply, gas purification, isotope separation, and exhaust gas handling devices. These components provide a complete tritium circulation in the system, and hence <b>tritium</b> <b>waste</b> can be minimized {{for a variety of}} experimental works. One of the chambers is designed for experiments using molecular tritium, and the other for tritium plasma generated with ECR discharge. A Zr-Ni alloy is applied for impurity removal from the exhaust gas from both of the experimental chambers and gas chromatography is used for the isotope separation of purified hydrogen isotope mixtures. Other kinds of gettering materials are used for tritium storage-supply. The exhaust gas handling system has two different devices; one is a conventional wet device, consisting of a Pt-catalyst bed and a molecular sieve bed, the other a dry device using two getter beds.

40|$|<b>Tritium</b> <b>waste</b> {{recycling}} {{is a real}} economic and ecological issue. Generally under the non-valuable Q 2 Oform (Q = H, D or T), waste can be converted into fuel Q 2 for a fusion machine (e. g. JET, ITER) by isotopeexchange reaction Q 2 O + H 2 = H 2 O + Q 2. Such a reaction is carried out over Ni-based catalyst bed packed ina thin wall hydrogen permselective membrane tube. This catalytic membrane reactor can achieve higherconversion ratios than conventional fixed bed reactors by selective removal of reaction product Q 2 bythe membrane according to Le Chatelier’s Law. This paper presents some preliminary permeation tests performed on a catalytic membrane reactor. Permeabilities of pure hydrogen and deuterium {{as well as those}} of binary mixtures of hydrogen, deu-terium and nitrogen have been estimated by measuring permeation fluxes at temperatures ranging from 573 to 673 K, and pressure differences up to 1. 5 bar. Pure component global fluxes were linked to perme-ation coefficient by means of Sieverts’ law. The thin membrane (150 �m), made of Pd–Ag alloy (23 wt. %Ag),showed good permeability and infinite selectivity toward protium and deuterium. Lower permeabilityvalues were obtained with mixtures containing non permeable gases highlighting the existence of gasphase resistance.

40|$|A {{process to}} recover tritium from tritiated {{water has been}} {{successfully}} demonstrated at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly. A 2 -stage palladium membrane reactor (PMR) is capable of recovering tritium from water without generating additional waste. A substantial amount of tritiated water will be generated in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor both from torus exhaust and auxiliary operations. In addition, this process {{can be used to}} recover tritium from tritiated waste water being prepared for disposal in radioactive waste repositories. A large quantity of tritiated waste water exists world wide because the predominant method of cleaning up tritiated streams is to oxidize tritium to tritiated water. A series of cold (non-tritium) water processing experiments were run in preparation for the tritiated water processing tests. Optimum operating conditions were determined with these experiments. Tritium was recovered from a container of molecular sieve loaded with 2050 g (2550 std. l) of water and 4. 5 g of tritium. The maximum water processing rate for the PMR system used was determined to be 0. 5 slpm. A control method was developed to automatically liberate steam from the molecular sieve and add the desired amount of CO before injection into the PMR system. The maximum decontamination factor achieved in the 1 st stage ranged from 100 to 260, depending on the inlet flow rate. Performance of the 2 nd stage could not be measured because the outlet tritium concentration was below the background of the ion chamber used for analysis. Although the DF could not be measured, it is known that the DF was high because no tritium was detected, except during start-up, in the <b>tritium</b> <b>waste</b> treatment system that was downstream from the PMR system. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|An {{organic polymer}} {{is used as}} a {{conventional}} standard material for tritium beta-ray sources. It is, present study, cis- 1, polybutadiene (CPB) was examined to be tritiated photochemically under UV irradiation. This method is expected to produce no tritiated byproduct, in contrast with conventional chemical syntheses from monomers having been applied to prepare standard tritium beta-ray sources and to immobilize tritium in the form of organic polymers. It was found that the UV irradiation on CPB in the presence of HT could cause CPB tritiated with producing no detectable tritiated byproduct. In addition, it was also observed that CPB was isomerized to its trans-isomer. There was a linear relation between the tritiation and the isomerization of CPB. A [－CH 2 －CH=CH－CH－] radical mechanism was proposed for the tritiation and the isomerization. The extent of the tritiation was rather low in the present study as 432 MBq/g for 10 hour UV irradiation from a low pressure mercury lamp (5 W) at 30 Torr of HT. The specific activity, however, was comparable to conventional beta-ray sources and hence this method is promising to prepare standard tritium beta-ray sources without producing tritiated byproducts.

These liquid wastes were generated from the Purex process (for producing plutonium) and the HM process (for producing <b>tritium).</b> The liquid <b>wastes</b> were designated as high-level wastes and low-level wastes. As the production requirements increased with the resulting increase in liquid wastes, additional storage tanks and associated facilities were constructed. Since the waste vol-ume was large and waste storage facilities construction was expensive, methods {{to reduce the cost}} of storing these wastes and increase the safety of storage were implemented. Storage tanks of differing designs and facilities to concentrate and to handle waste in the tank farms were constructed.

All of the tritium contained in the waste {{was assumed to be}} available as a gas in the free volume inside the waste container at the beginning of disposal, and to then permeate the stainless steel waste container. From estimates of the tritium content of each waste form, the void or free volume of the package, disposal temperature and container geometry, the amount of <b>tritium</b> exiting the <b>waste</b> container by permeation was calculated.

40|$|Compounds {{labelled}} with deuterium and tritium {{are widely}} used in the life sciences. Consequently {{there is always a}} need for improved methods - better incorporation, higher specificity, reduced reaction time etc. {{and in the case of}} <b>tritium,</b> less radioactive <b>waste.</b> This thesis is concerned with such aspects. Chapter 1 is a review of the background to tritium and current methods of labelling and analysis of hydrogen isotopes. In chapter 2 the possible use of an organometallic compound - the ruthenium dihydro complex, RuH 2 CO(PPh 3) 3, which is known to catalyse the insertion of olefins into the ortho position of aromatic ketones, is explored. Solid deuterated formates e. g. 2 -naphthy methyl-d-formate and d-formanilide were prepared and these were used to make the deuterated complex, RuD 2 CO(PPh 3) 3 which was used to exchange deuterium into the ortho position of aromatic ketones. Aromatic compounds with other functionalities, however were not so amenable to labelling, aromatic amides were the only other compounds successfully labelled. The method is therefore more restrictive than was hoped. A method to prepare tritiated formates by ozonolysis of 2 -[T]- 5 -phenyloxazole to a mixed anhydride followed by nucleophillic attack was discovered. [T]-formanilide was prepared in this way but only at low levels of radioactivity (0. 1 Ci/mmol, 3. 67 GBq/mmol) which prevented the tritiated complex being prepared. In chapter 3 the use of zeolites as strong acid catalysts for hydrogen isotope exchange reactions was explored. Isotope exchange was carried out on simple organic molecules using hydrogen, platinum and palladium exchanged zeolite-Y with D 2 O and HTO as isotope source. Some studies were also carried out using solid deuterium sources with the metal exchanged zeolites. Exchange occurred using 2 -naphthgyl methyl-d-formate, tetrabutyl ammonium-d-formate and potassium-d-formate.

40|$|International audienceAbstract In this paper, {{we aim at}} {{understanding}} tritium {{behavior in}} the graphite moderator of French CO 2 -cooled nuclear fission reactors (called UNGG for “Uranium Naturel-Graphite-Gaz”) to get information on its distribution and inventory in the irradiated graphite waste after their dismantling. These findings should be useful both to improve waste treatment processes and to foresee tritium behavior during reactor decommissioning and waste disposal operations. The {{purpose of the present}} work is to elucidate the effects of temperature on the behavior of tritium during reactor operation. Furthermore, it aims at exploring options of thermal decontamination. For both purposes, annealing experiments were carried out in inert atmosphere as well as in thermal conditions {{as close as possible to}} those encountered in UNGG reactors and in view of a potential decontamination in humid gas. D+ ions were implanted into virgin nuclear graphite in order to simulate tritium displaced from its original structural site through recoil during reactor operation. The effect of thermal treatments on the mobility of the implanted deuterium was then investigated at temperatures ranging from 200 to 1200 °C, in inert atmosphere (vacuum or argon), in a gas simulating the UNGG coolant gas (mainly CO 2) or in humid nitrogen. Deuterium was analyzed by Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) both at millimetric and micrometric scales. We have identified three main stages for the deuterium release. The first one corresponds to deuterium permeation through graphite open pores. The second and third ones are controlled by the progressive detrapping of deuterium located at different trapping sites and its successive migration through the crystallites and along crystallites and coke grains edges. Extrapolating the thermal behavior of deuterium to tritium, the results show that the release becomes significant above the maximum UNGG reactor temperature of 500 °C and should be lower than 30 % of the total amount produced over a reactor operating time corresponding to about 11 effective full-power years. Moreover, it would mainly concern the tritium located close to the free surfaces. Furthermore, the total extraction of the remaining <b>tritium</b> in graphite <b>waste</b> should be more efficient in dry inert gas than in humid gas, but would require temperatures higher than 1300 °C for the total removal of the most deeply located deuterium...|$|R
40|$|Legacy heavy-water {{moderator}} {{operations at}} the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{have resulted in the}} contamination of equipment pads, building slabs, and surrounding soil with tritium. At the time of discovery the tritium had impacted the shallow (< 3 -m) groundwater at the facility. While tritium was present in the groundwater, characterization efforts determined that a significant source remained in a concrete slab at the surface and within the associated vadose zone soils. To prevent continued long-term impacts to the shallow groundwater a CERCLA non-time critical removal action for these source materials was conducted to reduce the leaching of tritium from the vadose zone soils and concrete slabs. In order to minimize transportation and disposal costs, an on-site thermal treatment process was designed, tested, and implemented. The on-site treatment consisted of thermal detritiation of the concrete rubble and soil. During this process concrete rubble was heated to a temperature of 815 deg C (1, 500 deg F) resulting in the dehydration and removal of water bound tritium. During heating, tritium contaminated soil was used to provide thermal insulation during which it&#x 27;s temperature exceeded 100 deg C (212 deg F), causing drying and removal of tritium. The thermal treatment process volatiles the water bound tritium and releases it to the atmosphere. The released tritium was considered insignificant based upon Clean Air Act Compliance Package (CAP 88) analysis and did not exceed exposure thresholds. A treatability study evaluated the effectiveness of this thermal configuration and viability as a decontamination method for tritium in concrete and soil materials. Post treatment sampling confirmed the effectiveness at reducing <b>tritium</b> to acceptable <b>waste</b> site specific levels. With American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding three additional treatment cells were assembled utilizing commercial heating equipment and common construction materials. This provided a total of four units to batch treat concrete rubble and soil. Post treatment sampling verified that the activity in the treated soil and concrete met the treatment standards for each medium which allowed the treated concrete rubble and soil to be disposed of on site as backfill.
