40|$|This paper aims to {{test the}} {{capitalist}} and democratic peace arguments within <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Notwithstanding <b>the</b> theoretical arguments and empirical evidence which indicate two different dynamics of interstate conflict in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> and <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>worlds,</b> <b>the</b> proponents of both “democratic peace” and “capitalist peace” arguments did {{not take into account}} <b>the</b> distinction between <b>developing</b> and developed countries and tested their hypotheses within samples that included “all dyads” in different time periods. This study aims to fill this gap by testing capitalist and democratic peace arguments within <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> It tests <b>the</b> capitalist and democratic peace arguments through statistical analysis (logistic regression) of the militarized interstate disputes in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> between 1951 and 2000. The results support the “capitalist peace” argument and suggest that, within <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> economic development leads to interstate peace, whereas democracy does not.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} {{organizational and}} political issues {{associated with the use}} of geographic information systems (GIS) and land information systems (LB) in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> <b>The</b> paper suggests that “appropriate technology ” for <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> does not have to be old-fashioned or unsophisticated; it just has to be cheap, effective, reliable, and easy to use. As a result, the question of whether GIS technology is appropriate for regional planning in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is dependent on the availability of all four components of the GIS technology “package”: suitable equipment, appropriate information, proper organization, and available expertise. This paper considers each of these components as they relate to the use of GIS for regional planning in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world...</b>|$|R
