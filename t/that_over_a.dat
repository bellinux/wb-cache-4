5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought <b>that,</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|Carte finally {{assembled}} a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company {{to launch a}} series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, The Sorcerer, in November 1877. This work was a modest success, and H.M.S. Pinafore followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, Pinafore became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands {{and others at the}} theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Indeed, Pinafore was so successful <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.|$|E

Abstract The main aim of {{this paper}} is to give {{invariant}} properties of representations of algebras under cleft extensions <b>over</b> <b>a</b> semisimple Hopf algebra. Firstly, we explain the concept of cleft extension and give a relation between cleft extension and crossed product which is the approach we depend upon. Then, by making use of them, we prove <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> algebraically closed field k, for a finite dimensional Hopf algebra H which is semisimple as well as its dual H∗, the representation type of an algebra is an invariant property under a finite dimensional H-cleft extension. In the other part, we still show <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary field k, the Nakayama property of a k−algebra is also an invariant property under an H-cleft extension when the radical of the algebra is H-stable...|$|R
5|$|The storm's effects also {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} over 33,000cattleheads and inflicted a heavy blow to the country's November–December rice harvest. Crop damage occurred across 174,000hectares (430,000acres) of land in Bagerhat, Bhola, Khulna, and Satkhira districts as well as Cox's Bazar. The total gross weight of crop losses was estimated at 200,000tonnes (220,000tons), accounting for 70%of Bangladeshi crops that were ready for harvest. Extensive damage to infrastructure was reported across the nation. Most mud and straw houses and tin shed offices and schools were destroyed due to the storm. Telecommunications and electrical supplies were disrupted by the storm in at least sixteen towns and four coastal districts. In the capital city of Dhaka, debris and fallen trees caused by winds of up to 120km/h (75mph) {{resulted in}} both power outages and paralyzed traffic. The power outages also disrupted the city's distribution of water. In Shyamnagar Upazila, all mud and straw-constructed homes were destroyed. Overall, an official estimates suggested 50,000homes were destroyed across the country. However, independent investigations were more aggressive in their estimates, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> million homes accounting for 60–80% of homes in coastal Bangladesh were destroyed, displacing as many as seven million people.|$|E
