5|$|In 1974, {{a decade}} of work began on the {{construction}} of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with <b>this</b> <b>threat.</b> While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.|$|E

5|$|To counter <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> {{the group}} has {{galvanized}} an effort to strengthen the dam. Replacing the sand, which could shift during an earthquake, with more than 350 walls, {{the group has}} equipped the dam with sensors. Alarms are connected to these sensors, which would alert nearby citizens to the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to <b>this</b> <b>threat</b> by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 to deal with <b>this</b> <b>threat.</b> Politically, {{the suppression of the}} slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E

5|$|By 5 November, General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area (SWPA) {{had decided}} that the Finschhafen area would be {{developed}} into a major air and naval base, but the large Japanese force on Sattelberg still overlooked the base area. In order to remove <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> Wootten sent the 26th Infantry Brigade to capture Sattelberg on 16 November. On 25 November, after 10 days of fighting, and an advance up the southern approaches from Jivevaneng by infantry supported by artillery, armour and air support, Sattelberg was seized by the Australians. Having suffered heavy casualties, and short on supplies, the Japanese withdrew north to Wareo, where they established themselves in preparation for further attacks by the Australians.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. <b>This</b> <b>threat,</b> combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E
5|$|From early 1942 Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union. Operating from fjords on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. To counter <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> the Allies were forced to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet, and capital ships accompanied most convoys {{part of the way}} to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{following}} the Second World War's Battle of France, the United Kingdom was {{under threat of}} invasion from Germany. During the summer, the Battle of Britain dampened <b>this</b> <b>threat.</b> As the year progressed, {{the size of the}} British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised. During October, with the possibility of a German invasion during 1941, these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then assigned to newly created County Divisions.|$|E

5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 1941, Müncheberg was {{informed}} by Gruppenkommandeur Schöpfel that the 7. Staffel had {{to relocate to}} Sicily in support of X. Fliegerkorps, {{under the command of}} General der Flieger (General of the Flyers) Hans Geisler, for actions against the strategically important island of Malta. With the opening of a new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter <b>this</b> <b>threat</b> the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort to neutralise the RAF defences and the ports.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 9, Church formed Task Force Davidson to {{eliminate}} <b>this</b> <b>threat</b> to Yonil. The airfield itself had not been used {{since the middle of}} August except for emergency landing and refueling of planes, but evacuation of US Air Force equipment, bombs, and petroleum products was still in progress. Davidson commanded the task force, which was composed of the US 19th Infantry, less the 3rd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, the 13th Field Artillery Battalion, C Battery of the 15th Field Artillery Battalion, A Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company, two batteries of antiaircraft automatic weapons, and other miscellaneous units.|$|E

5|$|Spurred on by this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series of {{follow-up}} offensives in January and February 1943 intended to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of the}} remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk. Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. To deal with <b>this</b> <b>threat,</b> Army Group Don, Army Group B, and parts of Army Group A were united as Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 {{after falling}} gravely ill on the {{previous}} Christmas Day. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the chapter house at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, {{and it is possible}} that the stress of <b>this</b> <b>threat</b> caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.|$|E
5|$|The French {{operations}} in the area were hampered {{by a lack of}} a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to Malta, but that was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several submarines, one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914. <b>This</b> <b>threat</b> from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic. As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area. Later in the war, Démocratie was sent to Mudros along with her sister ships to reinforce the blockade of the Dardanelles.|$|E
