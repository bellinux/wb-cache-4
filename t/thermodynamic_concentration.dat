40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurements are {{described}} involving neutron spin echo and quasi-elastic light scattering in an end-linked polyfluorosilicone (PFS) gel swollen in acetone {{as well as}} in the equivalent solution. Small-angle elastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on the same system. For the PFSacetone system, both dynamic light scattering and neutron spin echo yield similar results for the characteristic relaxation rates and for the intensity scattered by concentration fluctuations. It is shown that the relaxing part of the spin echo decay is described by the same <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>concentration</b> fluctuations that define the osmotic modulus of the system. Both the collective diffusion coefficient and the intensity of the dynamically scattered light are found to be greater in the gel than in the solution. This difference indicates that the polymer solvent friction coefficient in the cross-linked network is lower than in the un-cross-linked solution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurements are {{reported}} of the osmotic swelling and elastic properties of cross-linked polyisoprene gels swollen in toluene, {{as a function}} of the polymer volume fraction r. The swelling pressure and shear modulus results may be combined to yield the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter λ for the cross-linked state of this system. It is found that λ can be expressed as λ) λ 0 + λ 1 r + λ 2 r 2, where λ 0) 0. 427, λ 1) 0. 000, and λ 2) 0. 112. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements are also reported for the same gels. The scattering intensity associated with the spontaneous <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>concentration</b> fluctuations in the gels is compared with that computed from the osmotic data. The agreement between the observed neutron intensities and the calculated values is good. The SANS measurements reveal two additional components to the scattered intensity: one due to the local elastic constraints of the cross-links and the other being caused by dense clusters that show no appreciable deformation when subjected to an external elastic strain field...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} able to simulate under dynamic conditions the physical, chemical and biological processes prevailing in a biological sulfate reducing gas-lift reactor. The proposed model is based on differential mass balance equations for substrates, products and bacterial groups involved in a sulfate reduction process. Heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria (HSRB), autotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria (ASRB), homoacetogenic bacteria (HB), methanogenic archaea (MA) and acetate degraders (AD) are the microbial groups {{taken into account in}} the model. The model is also used to validate a steady-state design model previously proposed by Esposito et al. 2009. The proposed model is able to simulate the competition between the biological bacteria growing in the reactor, and predict the performance of a gas-lift reactor. The model includes two main parts: 1) a kinetic part including growth, metabolism and competition of SRB, HB, MA and AD in the system and 2) a mass-transfer part describing the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>concentration</b> equilibria of gaseous components in the liquid and gas phase. The model has been validated using experimental data obtained by operating a laboratory-scale gas-lift reactor as described in Esposito et al. 2003. The model can be applied to simulate the sulfate reduction process in a gas-lift reactor for several purposes, such as the evaluation of the optimal process conditions in terms of COD:SO 42 - ratio, hydraulic retention time and gas input flow. In particular, model simulations reported in this paper show the model capability to predict the prevailing bacterial species and concentrations in the reactor {{as a function of the}} hydraulic retention time...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on the structural relaxation and the intermolecular cooperativity in dynamically asymmetric blends of PS/PVME (polystyrene/poly(vinyl methyl ether)). The temperature regime where chain connectivity effects dominate the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>concentration</b> fluctuation (T/T-g > 0. 75, T-g is the glass transition temperature of the blends) was studied using dielectric spectroscopy (DS). Interestingly, in the blends with MWNTs a bimodal distribution of relaxation was obtained in the loss modulus spectra. This plausibly is due to different environments experienced by the faster component (PVME) {{in the presence of}} MWNTs. The segmental dynamics of PVME was observed to be significantly slowed down in the presence of MWNTs and an Arrhenius-type behavior, weakly dependent on temperature, is observed at higher frequencies. This non-equilibrium dynamics of PVME is presumed to be originating from interphase regions near the surface of MWNTs. The length scale of the cooperative rearranging region (xi CRR) at T-g, assessed by calorimetric measurements, was observed to be higher in the case of blends with MWNTs. An enhanced molecular level miscibility driven by MWNTs in the blends corroborates with the larger xi CRR and comparatively more number of segments in CRR (in contrast to neat blends) around T-g. The configurational entropy and length scale of the cooperative volume was mapped as a function of temperature in the temperature regime, Tg < T < T-g + 60 K. The blends phase separated by spinodal decomposition which further led to an interconnected PVME network in PS.

Sinusoidal controlled disturbances were imposed at the laminar jet interface using a piezoelectric vibrating nozzle with breakup dynamics recorded using a high-speed camera and drop sizes measured using fiber Phase Doppler Anemometry. Emphasis was placed on how bulk and interfacial properties of the prepared liquids influenced ligament and drop evolution. It was found experimentally that if the proper concentration of surfactant was selected (close to the critical micelle concentration), and if the surfactant adsorption/desorption was fast enough, Marangoni interfacial stresses developed and led {{to an increase in}} satellite drop size (as was observed by previous researchers for breakup simulations of shear-thinning jets covered with insoluble surfactant). ^ In addition to experiments, a one-dimensional theoretical investigation based on Taylor expansions of liquid velocity, bulk surfactant concentration and pressure in the ligament, as proposed by Eggers and Dupont (1994), was carried out at low Reynolds number. The effect on jet dynamics of a soluble surfactant combined with either a generalized Newtonian liquid (Carreau fluid) or an elastic liquid (Johnson-Segalman) was analyzed. Using the model developed, the adsorption and desorption kinetics {{in the case of a}} generalized Newtonian liquid jet were shown to rely on the initial interfacial concentration of surfactant: if the surfactant at the jet exit plane was initially at the thermodynamic equilibrium value, a slowly adsorbed/desorbed surfactant could lead to a jump in satellite drop size (Mac, the critical Marangoni number, ∼ 1), while if the <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium <b>concentration</b> was not originally reached a the jet exit plane a slowly adsorbed/desorbed surfactant rarely led to a jump in satellite drop size (Mac 3 ̆e 2).

With time, the intermedaites equilibrate towards the global minimum, corresponding to the lowest overall Gibb's free energy (ΔG°), shown in blue on the reaction diagram in figure 1. The driving force for products to re-equilibrate towards the most stable products {{is referred to as}} thermodynamic control. The ratio of products to at any equilibrium state is determined by the relative magnitudes of free energy of the products. This relationship between population and relative energies is called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.|$|R
