5|$|Martinengo {{had been}} ill {{for some time}} before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been {{neglected}} and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the capella), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 {{at the age of}} 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional a cappella repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed <b>their</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.|$|E

It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts—willing or unwilling—to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for <b>their</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|E

25|$|A final {{submission}} to the United States Court of Appeals was submitted in October 1994, with Bonin contending {{such issues as}} his being denied the effective assistance of counsel at both his trials, {{that he had been}} denied due process at his Los Angeles trial due to the judge's refusing to suppress the testimony of Munro and Miley, and that the judge at his Orange County trial had denied his counsel's motion for a change of venue upon the basis that pretrial publicity had effectively minimized any chance of obtaining an unbiased jury within the county. This final appeal was rejected on June 28, 1995, with the appellate judges stating they had found no evidence of legal misconduct, and that no evidence existed that the 13 jurors who served upon Bonin's Orange County trial who had admitted to minimal, indirect pretrial exposure to the Freeway Killer case had, {{as a result of this}} pretrial publicity, been incapable of judging Bonin with impartiality. As such, the appellate judges declared <b>their</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the validity of Bonin's convictions.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because <b>their</b> <b>satisfaction</b> or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E

40|$|Visitors to the West Coast of the South Island {{were interviewed}} (using a survey {{questionnaire}} and in-depth interview techniques) {{in order to}} determine <b>their</b> <b>satisfactions</b> with the attractions which they had visited.

In-depth interviews with visitors to the Coast revealed a number of senses of place which were held by those visitors. The strongest of these were based around the natural and historic features of the area. Analysis of these senses of place pointed to the possibility that the psychological, aesthetic, and self-actualisation needs of visitors were being met by the experience, thus giving rise to feelings of satisfaction. Finally, the study recommended that the provision of access, careful development, retention, preservation, and signposting of natural and historic features of the Coast should be afforded a high priority if current levels of visitor satisfaction are to be maintained or increased...|$|R
500|$|After the {{relatively}} lukewarm commercial {{performance of their}} previous record, No Line on the Horizon (2009), lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty over how the band could remain musically relevant. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence—the longest gap between albums of their career—the group reportedly worked on three separate projects with multiple producers, including an aborted companion to their previous record called Songs of Ascent.
