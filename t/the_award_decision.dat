40|$|The Asian casino {{market has}} been rapidly {{expanding}} {{in recent years as}} evidenced by the success of recently built integrated resorts (IR) in Macau. In light of the successes in Macau, the Korean government has decided to allow an IR to be built near the Incheon International Airport in Korea. The airport, with its great number of transient passengers, provides ample potential customers for the proposed IR. Combining the two factors of Asian casino market growth, and the high number of potential customers, the Incheon IR has a great chance for success. The Korean government entertained bids from two different companies for the business license for the Incheon IR, Caesars Entertainment and Paradise-Sega Sammy. Based on business experience, capital, and size, the two companies were very comparable. The eventual winner of the business license was Paradise-Sega Sammy. The purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that led to the choice of Paradise-Sega Sammy as the winner.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an "audit" of the multistage application and appeal process that the U. S. Social Security Administration (SSA) uses to determine eligibility for disability {{benefits from the}} Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. We study a subset of individuals from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who applied for DI or SSI benefits between 1992 and 1996. We compare <b>the</b> SSA's ultimate <b>award</b> <b>decision</b> (i. e. after allowing for appeals) to the applicant's self-reported disability status. We use these data to estimate classification error rates under the hypothesis that applicants' self-reported disability status and <b>the</b> SSA's ultimate <b>award</b> <b>decision</b> are noisy but unbiased indicators of, a latent "true disability status" indicator. We find that approximately 20 % of SSI/DI applicants who are ultimately awarded benefits are not disabled, and that 60 % of applicants who were denied benefits are disabled. Our analysis also yields insights into the patterns of self-selection induced by varying delays and award probabilities at various levels of the application and appeal process. We construct an optimal statistical screening rule using a subset of objective health indicators that the SSA uses in making <b>award</b> <b>decisions</b> that results in significantly lower classification error rates than does SSA's current award process...|$|R
