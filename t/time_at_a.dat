5|$|Elements of the {{committee}} met with Lutyens in January 1919 to discuss options for the memorial. Lutyens argued against {{the committee}}'s initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park, which the committee agreed to. Lutyen's initial design consisted of a large ceremonial pillar with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a soldier lying on a sarcophagus. This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty sarcophagus or cenotaph, supported by a plinth {{on top of a}} pillar, with pine cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed to <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> total cost of £9,845.|$|E

Coal was also delivered by rail {{to the east of}} the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E

5|$|Federer and Andy Murray {{have met}} 25 times with Federer leading 14–11. Federer leads 12–10 on hard courts, and 2–1 on grass. They {{have never met}} on clay. The two have met six times at the Grand Slam tournament level, the first {{three times in the}} finals, Federer winning all three of these matches; at the 2008 US Open and the 2010 Australian Open, both of which he won in {{straight}} sets, and at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships in which Murray took the opening set, but went on to lose in four sets. However, Murray won their encounter in the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open, defeating the Swiss for the first <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Grand slam tournament in five sets. At the 2014 Australian Open, Federer reversed that result, defeating Murray in four sets in the quarterfinals. The most recent meeting between the two in a Major was in the semifinals of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, where a dominant Federer triumphed in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|In the 2017 Rogers Cup, held in Montreal, Nadal had {{a chance}} to regain the ATP No. 1 ranking if he made the semi-finals; however, he lost in the 3rd round to Canadian {{teenager}} Denis Shapovalov. Federer progressed to the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev and sustained an injury during the second set. Due to the renewed back injury, Federer then pulled out of the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, leaving Nadal as the only Big Four player competing there and allowing him to reclaim the ATP No. 1 ranking. In the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, Nadal was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals, breaking the streak of 42 consecutive Big Four appearances in Masters 1000 semi-finals and finals. At the US Open, Nadal was be seeded first (for the first <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> major since 2014), Murray second, and Federer, who is only 5 points behind Murray, third. The 2017 US Open would also be the first major Djokovic has missed after a streak of 51 consecutive appearances. Furthermore, Murray ultimately pulled out of the US Open, having not recovered from his hip injury suffered during Wimbledon, leaving just Nadal and Federer as the only Big Four players remaining in the draw. With this withdrawal, Murray would fall out of the top 2 {{for the first time since}} May 2016. Nadal made the semi-finals, while Federer lost in the quarter-finals to Juan Martin del Potro. This loss ended Federer's undefeated record in Grand Slam matches during 2017, and also marked the sixth time that both Federer and Nadal came within one match of meeting each other at the US Open, but did not do so due to one of them losing. This phenomenon previously occurred at the semi-finals of all US Opens between 2008 and 2011, and in the fourth round of the 2013 tournament. Nadal then defeated Del Potro to reach his first US Open final since 2013, and defeated Kevin Anderson in the final to win his third US Open title.|$|E
