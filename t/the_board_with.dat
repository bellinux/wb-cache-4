5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, chess was {{revolutionized}} {{by the new}} theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling the center of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> distant pieces rather than with pawns, which invited opponents to occupy the center with pawns, which become objects of attack.|$|E
5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

5|$|Graham was {{dismissed}} in February 1995, {{for bringing the}} club into disrepute over his transfer misconduct. He {{was found guilty of}} financial impropriety by a league investigation, leaving <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> no other choice but to terminate his contract. Stewart Houston came in as caretaker and revitalised the squad, taking Arsenal to the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. The Arsenal board subsequently hired Bruce Rioch, on a three-year deal in June 1995. Rioch's tenure lasted just 61 weeks and in his only season at the club, he guided Arsenal to fifth position, which came with a UEFA Cup spot. Rioch was sacked in August 1996, amid reports of disagreements with vice-chairman David Dein.|$|E
5|$|Nevada methodically {{moved down}} the field on their first drive and scored first on a 16-yard run by Stefphon Jefferson to cap off an 8-play, 75-yard drive. Later in the quarter, the Wolf Pack took a 14-0 lead {{following}} a 17-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cody Fajardo to Zach Sudfeld. Arizona fumbled on the ensuing kickoff. On the first play of their drive, Nevada took a 21-0 lead on a 28-yard touchdown pass to Sudfeld. All-American running back Ka'Deem Carey finally got Arizona on <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a 21-yard touchdown run {{late in the first}} quarter.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 Gator Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 1, 2001 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Early on, Virginia Tech took {{advantage}} of Clemson mistakes to build a first-quarter lead. On the game's first possession, the Tech defense forced a Clemson punt. Clemson mishandled the kick, and Tech was able to recover the ball at the Clemson 23-yard line. One play later, Tech was on <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a touchdown pass from quarterback Michael Vick. By {{the end of the}} first quarter, Tech had taken a 14–0 lead. Clemson was able to close the gap to 14–10 in the second quarter, but Tech added another touchdown before halftime to take a 21–10 lead into the second half.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{was never}} in {{contention}} during the game, as Michigan's offense was shut {{out in the first}} half, while Wisconsin's offense dominated Michigan's defense and jumped out to a 24–0 halftime lead. Wisconsin's only score of the first quarter was a 1-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball. In the second quarter, they added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by Philip Welch, a 27-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball, and a 61-yard run by James White. Michigan started the second half by finally getting on <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> 2 touchdowns: a 24-yard reception by Darryl Stonum, and then a 4-yard run by Denard Robinson. Wisconsin responded with a 23-yard run by James White. Michigan replied with an 11-yard run by Denard Robinson. The Badgers added to their lead on the opening play of the fourth quarter with a 3-yard run by Montee Ball. Wisconsin then more added points with a 40-yard field goal. Michigan's only score of the quarter was a 28-yard catch by Roy Roundtree. Wisconsin sealed its win with a 4-yard run by Montee Ball.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1996, exactly {{one year after}} the Hokies' {{previous}} bowl game. Instead of New Orleans, however, the Hokies were playing in stormy Miami, Florida at Pro Player Stadium. Neither team scored until late in the first quarter when Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller put Virginia Tech on <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Hokies' 7–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter didn't last long, however. Nebraska scored a field goal early in the second quarter and tacked on a touchdown to take a 10–7 lead halfway through the second quarter. Then Nebraska got its biggest play of the game as Tech's Druckenmiller fumbled the ball. A Nebraska player scooped up the ball, returning it 31yards for a touchdown. Tech was able to score a touchdown before halftime, but Nebraska still held a 17–14 lead as the second half began.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal-energy storage has received considerable attention {{in recent years}} due to their high storage density [1, 2]. A series of microencapsulated PCMs (Micro-PCMs) with good phase change behavior have been synthesized through in-situ polymerization and the applications of the obtained Micro-PCMs in thermal regulatory of gypsum boards are presented in this study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal that the Micro-PCMs were dispersed homogeneously in <b>the</b> gypsum <b>boards</b> (as seen in Fig. 1). Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results show that all <b>the</b> gypsum <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> different weight percent of the Micro-PCMs possess good phase change behavior (see Fig. 2). The melting and freezing temperatures {{as well as the}} latent heat of <b>the</b> gypsum <b>board</b> <b>with</b> 60 wt. % Micro-PCMs and 3 wt. % glass fibers are quite suitable for the potential thermal energy storage of building applications. Thermal cycling tests indicate that <b>the</b> gypsum <b>board</b> <b>with</b> Micro-PCMs maintains good thermal stability after 10 melting-freezing cycles. Furthermore, <b>the</b> gypsum <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> Micro-PCMs show a good thermal-regulated property as seen in Fig. 3. As the around temperature is 50 oC or 0 oC, the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> can be kept in the rage of 20 - 27 oC for about 20 min due to the phase change of the inside Micro-PCMs. The mechanical property of <b>the</b> gypsum <b>board</b> <b>with</b> Micro-PCMs is highly improved after adding 3 wt. % glass fibers. From the above results, it can be concluded that <b>the</b> gypsum <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> Micro-PCMs have a good potential for thermal energy storage purpose of building materials. 中国科学院大连化学物理研究所The {{application of}} phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal-energy storage has received considerable attention in recent years due to their high storage density [1, 2].

30|$|The {{results are}} shown in Table  1. As with dry-bending strength, the wet-MOR of CA boards was {{lower than that of}} <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. However, <b>the</b> wet-MOE of <b>boards</b> was higher than those of <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. The wet-MOR value of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> under {{effective}} conditions satisfied the type 13 requirement of JIS A 5908 (> 6.5  MPa) [19]. SH of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> was lower than that of <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> PF and pMDI, probably because the CA made particles brittle [31]. Gambhir and Jamwal [32] reported that brittle particles absorbed very little energy. This means that <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> CA seemed to result in weak holding power for screws. The SH value of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> bonded <b>with</b> CA satisfied type 8 standard of JIS A 5908 (> 300  N) [19]. As to the formaldehyde emission test, <b>the</b> <b>board</b> bonded <b>with</b> CA did not emit formaldehyde, such as <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> pMDI and PF. The formaldehyde emission value of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> bonded <b>with</b> CA was lower than the F**** criteria of the lowest formaldehyde emission of JIS A 5908 standard [19]. Thus, <b>boards</b> bonded <b>with</b> CA are environmentally friendly.|$|R
