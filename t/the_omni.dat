5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at <b>the</b> <b>Omni</b> Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E

25|$|The Georgia Tech vs. Georgia {{game was}} played in <b>the</b> <b>Omni</b> Coliseum for 14 years {{beginning}} in 1981 and ending in 1994.
