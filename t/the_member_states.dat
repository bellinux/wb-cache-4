5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. <b>The</b> exporting <b>member</b> <b>state</b> zero-rates <b>the</b> VAT. This means that <b>the</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). <b>The</b> importing <b>member</b> <b>state</b> [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to <b>the</b> importing <b>member</b> <b>state</b> at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|R
