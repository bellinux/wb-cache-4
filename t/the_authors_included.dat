5000|$|A {{number of}} {{alternate}} history stories and novels {{appeared in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries (see, for example, Charles Petrie's If: A Jacobite Fantasy 1926). In 1931, British historian Sir John Squire collected a series of essays {{from some of the}} leading historians of the period for his anthology If It Had Happened Otherwise. In this work, scholars from major universities (as well as important non-university-based authors) turned their attention to such questions as [...] "If the Moors in Spain Had Won" [...] and [...] "If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness". The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to Hendrik Willem van Loon's fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of Manhattan. Among <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>included</b> were Hilaire Belloc, André Maurois, and Winston Churchill.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently his {{interests}} shifted {{into the realm}} of contemporary architectural theory, and he developed a particular interest in Continental Philosophy and its potential impact on architectural thinking. Leach's position in regards to architectural theory was first set out in the [...] "cultural reader" [...] he edited, Rethinking Architecture (1997). The book contained a selection of well-known writings about architecture written by thinkers within Continental Philosophy, ranging from Hermeneutics and Phenomenology to Structuralism and Deconstruction, prefaced by Leach's own introductions. Among <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>included</b> were: Jacques Derrida, Martin Heidegger, Umberto Eco, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard and Walter Benjamin. What the selection set out to represent was a rethinking of architectural practice; making it a critical activity, not simply accepting the given paradigm, {{while at the same time}} placing architecture within the realm of cultural studies. He subsequently published a series of edited volumes and monographs based on material from that book.|$|E
