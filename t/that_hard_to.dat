500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is obviously very complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not quite sure {{how they feel about}} the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times panned the [...] "overwhelmingly complicated, globe-hopping, enemies within, enemies without story line" [...] and 3D but noted that [...] "the humor, when it works, offers 'Retaliation' some redemption." [...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} have to think <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{keep up with the}} Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} album's concept, and for being more humorous than the band's preceding albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's hard not to warm to this, even if his music isn't your own personal bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's not all <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> imagine Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it might be one of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice." [...] Entertainment.ie called it an entertaining pop album, and summarized that [...] "the pop world would be a much more boring place without —and that's what really counts." ...|$|E

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

6000|$|No {{one will}} have a {{difficulty}} now in understanding how that could be, but in the evil days of the world malaria, {{that would have been}} held to be the most impossible thing. I should have had to crush that second love out of my thoughts, to have kept it secret from Anna, to have lied about it to all the world. The old-world theory was there was only one love--we who float upon a sea of love find <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand. The whole nature of a man was supposed {{to go out to the}} one girl or woman who possessed him, her whole nature to go out to him. Nothing was left over--it was a discreditable thing to have any overplus at all. They formed a secret secluded system of two, two and such children as she bore him. All other women he was held bound to find no beauty in, no sweetness, no interest; and she likewise, in no other man. The old-time men and women went apart in couples, into defensive little houses, like beasts into little pits, and in these [...] "homes" [...] they sat down purposing to love, but really coming very soon to jealous watching of this extravagant mutual proprietorship. All freshness passed very speedily out of their love, out of their conversation, all pride out of their common life. To permit each other freedom was blank dishonor. That I and Anna should love, and after our love-journey together, go about our separate lives and dine at the public tables, until the advent of her motherhood, would have seemed a terrible strain upon our unmitigable loyalty. And that I should have it in me to go on loving Nettie--who loved in different manner both Verrall and me--would have outraged the very quintessence of the old convention.|$|E
