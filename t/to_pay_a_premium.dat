25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds {{are referred to as}} callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium,</b> the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.|$|E

The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E

In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… we had on hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859.

The aim is to {{investigate}} how consumers perceive organic premium products {{and if they are}} willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> price <b>premium</b> for these products. We conducted an experiment with 426 Danish consumers, in which we manipulate production method (organic vs. conventional), premium production (premium vs. non-premium) and extrinsic quality (high vs. low) across three meat products (pork, beef and chicken). Our findings show that consumers perceive organic products as of higher quality. However, they are not willing to purchase or <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> price <b>premium</b> for organic products per se. What makes consumers increase their purchase intention is to <b>a</b> greatest extent <b>premium</b> production and less extrinsic quality. Premium production did not interact with organic, thus consumers remain unaffected as to whether the product is organic or not. In other words, a product being organic does not increase willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> price <b>premium</b> or purchase intention for premium products. Similar is the case for products of low extrinsic quality, in the assumption that organic production may jeopardize a product’s extrinsic quality...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} in the marketing literature has indicated that, while consumers’ interests in ethical products are growing, demand for such products still remains weak. Previous {{research has indicated that}} anticipated guilt can {{have a positive effect on}} ethical consumption. Thus, the objective of the current study is to investigate the moderating role of consumers’ socially responsible consumption behaviour (SRCB) on the relationship between anticipated guilt and ethical consumption. Specifically, the current study hypothesizes that, when viewing a guilt ad, high (vs. low) SRCB individuals will generate higher, ethical purchase intentions, willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> ethical <b>premium,</b> and attitudes toward an ethical brand. The findings from the two experimental studies indicate that, when viewing a guilt ad for an ethical product, high SRCB individuals are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> higher ethical <b>premium</b> and generate more favourable brand attitudes than low SRCB individuals. However, when viewing a non-guilt ad, high SRCB individuals did not differ from low SRCB individuals in their willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> ethical <b>premium</b> or brand attitudes. Further, consumers’ socially conscious self-identity was explored as a mediator of these effects. By understanding the moderating role that SRCB plays in the relationship between anticipated guilt and ethical consumption, this paper intends to assist marketers in understanding for which consumers a guilt appeal is an appropriate strategy in marketing ethical products...|$|R

60|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} {{at first sight}} that when the exchange is unfavorable, or, in other words, when bills are at a premium, the premium must always amount to a full equivalent {{for the cost of}} transmitting money. But a small excess of imports above exports, or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries, does not usually affect the exchanges to {{the full extent of the}} cost and risk of transporting bullion. The length of credit allowed generally permits, on the part of some of the debtors, a postponement of payment, and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way, and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals. And this is the more likely to happen, as there is a self-adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself. Bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported. But the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export. Besides the price they obtain for their goods, they draw for the amount and gain the premium. It is, on the other hand, a diminution of profit to those who import. Besides the price of the goods, they have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for remittance. So that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export, and a discouragement to import. And if the balance due is of small amount, and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade, it is soon liquidated in commodities, and the account adjusted by means of bills, without the transmission of any bullion. Not so, however, when the excess of imports above exports, which has made the exchange unfavorable, arises from a permanent cause. In that case, what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices, and it can only be restored by acting on prices. It is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports, and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills; for, if the exports were kept up to the imports, bills would not be at a premium, and the extra profit would not exist. It is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Urban Land Development) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. California {{adopted the}} CalGreen {{building}} code in 2011, which requires developers to incorporate green features in new commercial buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The code provides cities {{the opportunity to}} require additional features above the minimum standard. However, the literature on green buildings suggests that rent per square foot could differ between markets and submarkets depending on the demand for green buildings. Using the CoStar Professional Property(c) commercial property database, I perform a regression analysis using the log rent per square foot per year {{as the dependent variable}} and explanatory variables that control for quality, size, and location. I use LEED and Energy Star buildings to control for green buildings and multiply these variables with the submarket variables to measure the demand for green buildings within each submarket. 	After controlling for size, quality, and location, I find that tenants are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> rental <b>premium</b> for Energy Star certified buildings in all submarkets across California, while the rental premium for LEED buildings is not statistically significant. However, I find that certain submarkets within California are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> rental <b>premium</b> for LEED features, suggesting that there is a difference in demand for green buildings. I find that tenants in cities with residents with more education and higher incomes could be willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for the non-financial benefits of LEED buildings. In addition, tenants in locations that culturally favor the green features of LEED could be more willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> rental <b>premium.</b> My findings first suggest that each city needs to assess the demand for green buildings before raising the developments standards. Second, cities that have insufficient demand could offer development incentives if the societal benefit of the green features outweigh the costs. Finally, California should align the building standard more closely with energy star, since tenants in California are more willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for energy savings and it would further decrease the greenhouse gas emissions.
