40|$|Currently, mould {{design and}} <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process {{parameters}} of transfer moulding for electronic packages are done manually in a trial-and-error manner. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters is largely {{dependent on the}} experience of engineers. The paper describes an intelligent process design system for transfer moulding of electronic packages that is used to determine optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters mainly based on case-based reasoning, artificial neural networks and a multiobjective optimization scheme. The system consists of two modules: a case-based reasoning module and a process optimization module. The former module is used to determine initial mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters while the latter module is used to determine optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters. Implementation of the intelligent system has demonstrated that the time for the determination of optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters can be greatly reduced, and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters recommended by the system can contribute to the good quality of moulded packages.
