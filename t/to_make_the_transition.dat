5|$|As of 2014, Spokane {{is still}} trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of}} a less {{prominent}} manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|Playschool or leikskóli, is non-compulsory {{education}} for those {{under the age}} of six, and {{is the first step in}} the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 2007. The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that playschools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> into compulsory education as easy as possible. However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the local authority, who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.|$|E
50|$|The game {{also takes}} {{advantage}} of a cut part of the Portal series in Pneumatic Diversity vents/tubes, which were featured in early trailers for Portal 2. They are used in Aperture Tag to move the player from level to level in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> faster.|$|R
30|$|For {{the event}} {{boundary}} and event middle conditions, summary movies (highlights) were created from the still frames drawn {{from either the}} event boundary or event middle. The frames were individually presented on the screen for 3  seconds at a time, with a 250 -ms faded transition {{before and after the}} still was presented, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> between frames more natural.|$|R
5000|$|A GFSK {{modulator}} {{differs from}} a simple frequency-shift keying modulator in that before the baseband waveform (levels −1 and +1) goes into the FSK modulator, it is passed through a Gaussian filter <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> smoother so <b>to</b> limit its spectral width. Gaussian filtering is a standard way for reducing spectral width; it is called [...] "pulse shaping" [...] in this application.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a {{significant}} amount of time working on new return strategies and formations. Ultimately, Lovie Smith converted Hester into a wide receiver in order {{to increase the number of}} opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of Deion Sanders. However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E
5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2011, WSET began {{broadcasting}} {{its local}} newscasts in high definition, {{the station is}} the third in the Roanoke-Lynchburg market <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to HD.|$|E
25|$|The ITER project aims <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> long-awaited <b>transition</b> from {{experimental}} studies of plasma physics to full-scale electricity-producing fusion power stations.|$|R
5000|$|Rather than {{directly}} modulating {{the frequency}} with the digital data symbols, [...] "instantaneously" [...] changing the frequency {{at the beginning of}} each symbol period, Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) filters the data pulses with a Gaussian filter <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> smoother. This filter has the advantage of reducing sideband power, reducing interference with neighboring channels, at the cost of increasing intersymbol interference. It is used by DECT, Bluetooth, Cypress WirelessUSB, Nordic Semiconductor, Texas Instruments LPRF, Z-Wave and Wavenis devices. For basic data rate Bluetooth the minimum deviation is 115 kHz.|$|R
30|$|Equations  112 and 115 are the Equations  61 and 64 in the text, respectively. The latter signifies {{that the}} {{probability}} density function for <b>the</b> population <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> next <b>transition</b> is exponentially distributed.|$|R
25|$|On September 12, 2016, it was {{reported}} that starting with Chrome 56, users will be warned when they visit non-secure HTTP websites to encourage more sites <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to HTTPS.|$|E
25|$|Karl Dane's rapid career decline, {{depression}} and subsequent death {{have been cited}} as an extreme example of the fate that befell many silent film stars who were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from silent to sound films.|$|E
25|$|Vélez's accent {{would likely}} hamper her ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition.</b> That idea was dispelled after she {{appeared}} in her first all-talking picture in 1929, the Rin Tin Tin's vehicle Tiger Rose. The film was a hit and Vélez's sound career was established.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, {{societies}} {{also learn}} {{from those who}} have gone through these transitions before and, therefore, may be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> faster and better. When the Netherlands introduced primary education in 1618, it was a pioneering initiative. When Japan did the same thing late in the 19th century, it had the advantage of the experience of the USA and other countries. When many Asian countries initiated primary education in the 1950s after winning independence, they could draw on the vast experience of more developed nations. This is a major reason for the quickening pace of progress.|$|R
50|$|Jun Akiyama (born 1973) is a Japanese {{video game}} event {{director}} and scenario writer {{who works at}} Square Enix. He joined the predecessor company Square in 1995. In his role as event planner for Final Fantasy VII, Akiyama {{was responsible for the}} story elements and cutscenes involving the characters Red XIII and Yuffie Kisaragi, respectively. During his work as the event director of Vagrant Story, he intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> between gameplay and event scenes as smooth as possible. The fully polygonal graphics of the game entailed precise camera movements, character animations and the usage of different lens effects.|$|R
50|$|For this reason, power {{switches}} {{intended to}} interrupt a load current have spring mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> between {{on and off}} is as short as possible regardless of {{the speed at which}} the user moves the rocker.|$|R
25|$|In 1931, José A. Ferreyra {{directed}} Muñequitas porteñas, {{the first}} Argentine film {{to be made}} with Vitaphone sound synchronisation. That year, Ferreyra made a second sound film, El Cantar de mi ciudad, encouraging other early directors <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to sound.|$|E
25|$|Nursery school, or leikskóli, is non-compulsory {{education}} for {{children younger than}} six years, and {{is the first step}} in the education system.

25|$|Future U.S. President James Madison was a {{key figure}} in the {{transition}} to religious freedom in Virginia, and Reverend Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped The College of William & Mary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> as well, and to become a university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine in the process.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from <b>the</b> racetrack to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses.|$|R
25|$|Lawrence & Foulks {{was one of}} the few New York shipyards {{to survive}} the post-Civil War slump, but was either unwilling or unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> postwar <b>transition</b> from wooden to iron shipbuilding, and closed its doors around the turn of the century.|$|R
50|$|Secure {{attachment}} {{in infancy}} {{was characterized by}} noticeable distress when the parent left the room. When the parent returned, the child was extremely happy to see them. Infants {{are more likely to}} choose a parent over any other person, especially a stranger. As they embark on childhood, those who maintain secure attachment have an easier time making friends and meeting new people and hold a trustworthy bond with their parents. Adolescents benefit from parental support, but they are also beginning <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> from relying heavily on their parents to a more independent environment with more freedom. In adulthood, {{they are more likely to}} have long-lasting relationships, high self-esteem, find pleasure from romantic relationships and are able to easily talk with their partners.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} TV {{effectively}} destroyed Australia's once thriving radio production industry {{within a few}} years, {{and the absence of}} local production quotas for TV in this formative period compounded the problem. Faced with almost unbeatable competition from American-made programming, local technical and creative professionals in radio were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to the new medium, as many of their American and British counterparts had done when TV was introduced there.|$|E
25|$|The Baghdadis {{and later}} the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) {{provided}} some assistance with the housing and food problems. Faced with language barriers, extreme poverty, rampant disease and isolation, the refugees were able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from being supported by welfare agencies to establishing a functioning community. Jewish cultural life flourished: schools were established, newspapers were published, theaters produced plays, sports teams participated in training and competitions, and even cabarets thrived.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> between drivers as {{seamless}} as possible, system {{designers have}} attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver {{is in the same}} vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.|$|E
30|$|A {{robustness}} check {{with a sample}} of individuals ages 25 and over is provided in Panel A of the Appendix: Table  14. The result that immigrant workers are more likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> employment-to-unemployment <b>transition</b> holds up with the sample of adults who are likely to have completed their education.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the 2010s, several {{governmental}} analysts observed that commercial networks were having trouble making the transition to digital television and subsequently, a $250m rebate was implemented on their licensing fees. The government funded stations, ABC and SBS, received increased funding in the closing stages of the 2000s to enable them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to digital TV. Meanwhile, the community station C31 received no government assistance or funding to make the transition; this still remains a source of controversy.|$|E
25|$|Thus, they {{maintain}} {{that the only way}} socialism will come about is for a majority of people, on a worldwide basis, to believe in the superiority of this alternative social system. They endorse the theory of impossibilism, and favour achieving this objective through the use of elections, although in the current situation their main function is as a propaganda group to try to raise consciousness. In contrast to Leninists, they believe that it is possible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from capitalism to the complete abolition of the state immediately that the majority decide to do it.|$|E
25|$|Imran Tahir {{was born}} in Lahore, Pakistan, and learnt the game while growing up there. Being the eldest sibling, he started working {{at the age of}} 16 as a retail {{salesman}} at Lahore's Pace Shopping Mall on a meager salary, to support his family. His fortunes changed when he was selected during trials to represent the Pakistan U-19 cricket team, eventually progressing onto the Pakistan A side on some tours. However, he failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to the next stage. Pakistan were blessed with some quality spinners and Tahir could not make his mark at the senior level to warrant a selection.|$|E
50|$|The World Wars {{significantly}} influenced society's {{view and}} treatment of individuals with disabilities. Before the wars, individuals with disabilities were considered as burdens on society. As many veterans of war returned home with physical impairments and psychological needs, new programs {{had to be put}} in place <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> back into society, as traditional methods were not able to accommodate.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Dallas, Texas, Betty Luna hurled two no-hitters during her seven {{seasons in the}} All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. A hard-thrower, {{she was one of}} <b>the</b> few {{pitchers}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> successful <b>transition</b> from underhand to overhand through the many stages of the circuit, although she pitched on awful expansion teams that did not give her much run support.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{non-profit}} and non-governmental organizations that seek <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sociocultural <b>transition</b> {{easier and more}} efficient for the refugees. One such organization, Saejowi, provides defectors with medical assistance {{as well as an}} education in diverse topics ranging from leadership and counseling techniques to sexual violence prevention and avoidance. Another organization, PSCORE, runs education programs for refugees, providing weekly English classes and one-on-one tutoring.|$|R
