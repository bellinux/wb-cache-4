Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> {{in which the}} {{point-like}} particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E

In 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defined care coordination and proposed five <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> for exploring care coordination. This study aimed to update current <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> and clarify key concepts related to care coordination. Methods: We performed a literature review to update existing <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks.</b> An in-depth analysis of these <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> was conducted to formulate key concepts related to care coordination. Results: Our literature review found seven previously unidentified <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> for studying care coordination.

These were ‘external factors’, ‘structure’, ‘tasks characteristics’, ‘cultural factors’, ‘knowledge and technology’, ‘need for coordination’, ‘administrative operational processes’, ‘exchange of information’, ‘goals’, ‘roles’, ‘quality of relationship’, ‘patient outcome’, ‘team outcome’, and ‘(inter) organizational outcome’. Conclusion: These 14 interrelated key concepts provide a base to develop or choose a framework for studying care coordination. The relational coordination theory and the multi-level framework are interesting as these are the most comprehensive. </p...|$|R
