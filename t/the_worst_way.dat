[...] Brown delivers his vocals in an aggressive and manipulative manner as he sings [...] "Give it to her in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>way,</b> can't wait to blow her candles out." [...] At the end of the song, Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude; [...] "Remember how you did it/ If you still wanna kiss it/ Then come and get it." [...] According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun, the instrumentation of [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] consists of [...] "snaky, slurpy, bass-droppin' beats."

2500|$|Moller {{also was}} present at Prague, Olomouc and Zorndorf. [...] There, at Zorndorf, Moller's {{artillery}} was {{a key to the}} battle plan. [...] Frederick's plan of attack was first to hammer the Russian right with heavy artillery fire and then to launch Heinrich von Manteuffel's advanced guard against it. Expecting cavalry, the Russians formed in a square, the best way to receive an mounted attack but <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>way</b> to receive an artillery barrage. Moller opened fire with 60 total of his 18- and 24-pounders, placed in two locations around Zorndorf; the initial range was too far, so they closed about 600 paces, and then ripped the Russian squares apart. [...] Russian sources reported that one particular cannon shot killed or wounded 48 grenadiers. Despite this accuracy, Moller's contribution at Zorndorf could not be measured in a single stroke, but in his ability to move his horse artillery around the battlefield. At 1:00 pm, they were in one place, firing canister into tightly-packed Russian formations; [...] at 4:00 pm, they were another place, pounding the Russian line; at 7:00, they were elsewhere, preventing a Russian counter-attack.|$|E
2500|$|On March 11, 2016, HRC {{voted to}} endorse Republican US Senator Mark Kirk over his Democratic Party {{challenger}} Representative Tammy Duckworth in his re-election bid to the US Senate. [...] The endorsement {{was met with}} widespread surprise and criticism in news media and social media as HRC had given Kirk a score of 78 percent out of 100 percent on LGBT issues, while HRC awarded Duckworth a score of 100 percent. David Nir at Daily Kos called the endorsement as [...] "appalling as it is embarrassing" [...] and [...] "pathetic and stupid", while Slate observed that Democrat control of the Senate was effectively necessary for passing the Equality Act of 2015 and beneficial for many other LGBT equality issues, and thus {{it would be in}} line with the organization's stated goals for Duckworth to be elected rather than Kirk. Meanwhile, The New Republic stated that, in light of a recent internal report revealing HRC's [...] "serious diversity problem", [...] "Choosing the white male candidate in this race over the Asian-American female candidate—someone who happens to have a better voting record anyway—is probably <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>way</b> of convincing your detractors that you are taking a core problem seriously." [...] HRC president Chad Griffin defended the endorsement in a column published by the Independent Journal Review, describing the senator's work on behalf of LGBT equality issues including co-sponsoring the Equality Act of 2015. Griffin stated: [...] "The truth is we need more cross party cooperation on issues of equality, not less", adding [...] "when members of Congress vote the right way and stand up for equality — regardless of party — we must stand with them. We simply cannot ask members of Congress to vote with us, and then turn around and try to kick them out of office." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{critics were}} {{satisfied}} with the episode: the British newspapers The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both reported that [...] "The End" [...] received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale and stated that he didn't consider the episode to be [...] "wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series", highlighting the episode's [...] "narrative dead ends" [...] as part of the reason. Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture". Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe also gave the episode a mixed review, citing some of the episode's [...] "quite hokey" [...] metaphors. David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, describing the final scenes as [...] "wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light [...] huggy-bear". He added: [...] "It looked like [...] was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music – just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another." [...] Max Read of Gawker was also particularly scathing, calling the finale [...] "incredibly dumb" [...] and remarking that [...] "it ended in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>way</b> possible". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode 1½ stars out of 5, saying that many fans would wish [...] "for a time slip that would give them those 2½ hours and possibly six seasons back". M.L. House of TV Fanatic felt [...] "bored" [...] and [...] "especially disappointed" [...] by the finale, and that the show's resolution was [...] "overarching". Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer also spoke negatively of the finale, calling the series [...] "one of TV's longest, lamest cons." [...] Laura Miller of Salon.com suggested that the finale episode was a failure because of its fan base, calling the series [...] "the quintessential example of a pop masterpiece ruined by its own fans." ...|$|E
