50|$|APG101 {{constitutes}} an innovative approach to treating GBM. The <b>therapeutic</b> <b>aim</b> {{is to increase}} both progression-free as well as overall survival of patients with GBM. The therapeutic approach is based on research conducted by the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). As demonstrated by Kleber et al., the binding of the CD95 ligand to its cognate receptor stimulates the invasive growth of glioblastoma cells. Thus, the inhibition of this interaction through APG101 reduces tumor cell growth and migration. An article published in the scientific journal Nature by Prof. Marcus Peter and his team at the University of Chicago provides additional evidence for APG101’s principle of inhibiting the CD95/CD95L system {{in the treatment of}} tumors.|$|E

5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{interpretation}} {{comes from the}} New Wittgenstein family of interpretations under development since 2000. This so-called [...] "resolute reading" [...] is controversial and much debated. The main contention of such readings is that Wittgenstein in the Tractatus {{does not provide a}} theoretical account of language that relegates ethics and philosophy to a mystical realm of the unsayable. Rather, the book has a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>aim.</b> By working through the propositions of the book the reader comes to realize that language is perfectly suited to all his needs, and that philosophy rests on a confused relation to the logic of our language. The confusion that the Tractatus seeks to dispel is not a confused theory, such that a correct theory would be a proper way to clear the confusion, rather the need of any such theory is confused. The method of the Tractatus is to make the reader aware of the logic of our language as he is already familiar with it, and the effect of thereby dispelling the need for a theoretical account of the logic of our language spreads to all other areas of philosophy. Thereby the confusion involved in putting forward e.g. ethical and metaphysical theories is cleared in the same coup.|$|E

30|$|Positive {{therapeutic}} approaches {{refer to}} clinical practices {{concerned with the}} facilitation of optimal functioning as well the alleviation of distress and dysfunction (Joseph & Linley [2006]). It may not be apparent at first why clinicians should be interested in positive functioning, {{but there are a}} number of reasons. First, the benefits of well-being include better physical health (Chida & Steptoe [2008]; Howell et al. [2007]), improved social and occupational functioning (Pavot & Diener [2004]), and a decreased likelihood of future psychopathology (Wood & Joseph [2010]). Second, as with traditional measures of dysfunction, feedback on positive functioning is also likely to be helpful to both clients and therapists (Rashid & Ostermann [2009]). Third, by fostering engagement, meaning and positive emotions as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>aim</b> it may also be helpful in treating current disorders such as depression (Seligman et al.

The recognized effects of ucOC are the improvement of insulin secretion from the pancreas, the amelioration of systemic insulin sensitivity, in particular in skeletal muscle, and the stimulation of the global endocrine activity of the Leydig cell, including vitamin D 25 -hydroxylation and testosterone production.
