5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> {{to recover from}} such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, {{as well as the}} remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{reveals that}} Gray {{felt that the}} poem was unimportant, {{and that he did}} not expect it to become as popular or {{influential}} as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.|$|E

5|$|Despite the coup's {{failure and}} his death, Abdallah {{had been able}} to {{consolidate}} his control over Mosul, becoming the virtual founder of a Hamdanid-ruled emirate there. During his long absences in Baghdad in his final years, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to his eldest son, al-Hasan, the future Nasir al-Dawla. After Abdallah's death, Hasan's position in Mosul was challenged by his uncles, and it was not until 935 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to secure confirmation by Baghdad of his control over Mosul and the entire Jazira up to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E

After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store.

5|$|The {{reign of}} King Donnchad I from 1034 {{was marred by}} failed {{military}} adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040. MacBeth ruled for seventeen years, so peacefully <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to leave to go on pilgrimage to Rome. However, he was overthrown by Máel Coluim, the son of Donnchad who some months later defeated MacBeth's stepson and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III. In subsequent medieval propaganda Donnchad's reign was portrayed positively, while MacBeth was vilified. William Shakespeare followed this distorted history in describing both men and the Queen consort Gruoch in his play Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock {{near the town of}} Brocklesby.|$|E

He instead sends a {{different}} D-Mail in an attempt to convince Faris' father to not part with the IBN computer. Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of him. In this worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in Rainet Access Battlers card game tournaments. Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him, Okabe is still satisfied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to prevent Mayuri's death. He decides to build a new life with Faris at his side.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta had {{continued}} writing articles, {{in which he}} reflected Padmore's influence. He produced an article for a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster {{was married}} to Isabella, {{daughter}} of Henry, Lord Beaumont, in 1330. The two had no sons, but two daughters: Maud and Blanche. While Maud {{was married to}} William I, Duke of Bavaria, Blanche married Edward III's son John of Gaunt. Gaunt ended up inheriting Lancaster's possessions and ducal title, {{but it was not}} until 1377, when the dying King Edward III was largely incapacitated, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to restore the palatinate rights for the county of Lancaster. When Gaunt's son Henry of Bolingbroke usurped the crown in 1399 and became Henry IV, the vast Lancaster inheritance, including the Lordship of Bowland, was merged with the crown as the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but it is thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to {{maintain}} the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825 Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercia's supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded {{to take control of}} the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829 he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove him out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle subsequently described Ecgberht as a bretwalda or 'wide-ruler' of Anglo-Saxon lands.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to control the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of Cold Feet began in January 1998. Bullen {{continued}} his method of developing storylines based on his own life; {{he and his wife}} had their first child in the latter half of 1997, so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny, who have their first child in Cold Feets first episode. Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet. During the second series he cut back to one show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident enough that he would have a future in television <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E

5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to appoint Prime Ministers {{on the basis of}} his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E
