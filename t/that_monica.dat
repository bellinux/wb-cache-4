5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner to find <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants}} to humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, {{the issue is}} not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note. Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group. Further tests showed <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music. Interestingly, a later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.|$|E

25|$|Monica Charles Brooks-Dent (played by Keesha Sharp) is William's wife. All {{four of the}} girlfriends (especially Lynn and Toni) {{hated her}} (Joan comes to see her {{vulnerable}} side and becomes her friend, and Toni moves to New York {{at the end of}} the sixth season). In the seventh season, they slowly and later fully accept Monica as their friend as Monica does the same. Although engaged to William, the two date twice before; they meet at a bar the first time. Since the last time William proposes to her in Monaco, he has occasionally had doubts about ever doing so. Eventually he marries her, but on their wedding day he has too much to drink and confesses that he has had and still has doubts about marrying her. Monica leaves William in Season 7 but returns shortly after the girlfriends go to Chicago to persuade her to get back together with William. On their visit, they discover <b>that</b> <b>Monica,</b> due to her father's dementia and her mother's power of attorney, has been cut off from her family fortune, so Joan offers Monica a job at the J-Spot. William is thrilled about Monica's return until she demands half of what he earned while they were married. They manage to slowly rebuild their relationship but constantly clash at the J-Spot. In the Season 7 finale, they get back together. By Season 8, Monica was pregnant and is seen spending more time with the other three girlfriends, particularly Joan.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> serves as [...] "the solid center in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E

500|$|Early in the series, Monica's {{apartment}} is established {{as one of}} the show's two primary locations. In the pilot, the apartment number is 5, which was changed to 20 in subsequent episodes after the writers determined <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> actually lived on a much higher floor. Season three's [...] "The One Where No One's Ready" [...] takes place entirely in Monica's apartment because the show's budget was not large enough to accommodate additional sets or guest stars at that time. In the series finale, Phoebe certifies that each character shared Monica's apartment at least one point during their lives.|$|E
500|$|Several {{months before}} Friends premiered, NBC had {{conducted}} a research report, {{the results of}} which determined <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> was the only character to have been remotely well received by test audiences. When Friends first aired, critics initially perceived Monica – who was immediately established as the show's [...] "mother hen" [...] – and Cox as the series' main character and star, respectively. Critics have been largely receptive towards both Cox and her character; the Los Angeles Times holds Cox's acting responsible for disproving the stigma that attractive women are incapable of delivering comedic performances. Revered as a television icon, Monica famously addressed several topics that were rarely discussed in prime time television at the time, including safe sex, casual sex, and age disparity in relationships. Despite garnering positive reviews for her performance, Cox is the only main cast member to have never been nominated for an Emmy Award during Friends ten-year run.|$|E
500|$|In the pilot, Monica is dumped almost {{immediately}} after sleeping with her new date Paul {{on the night of}} their first date. Monica is tricked into bed with him after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone {{in the two years since}} his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica's role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC's west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica's role in the pilot, which he considered [...] "casual sex", and created a [...] "stacked" [...] questionnaire asking audience members if they thought Monica was a whore. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.|$|E

Monica has short-lived romantic involvements with both singer Wayne Masterson and married Titania Records executive Neil Kittredge.

500|$|Cox married actor David Arquette in 1999 {{while the}} show was on hiatus between seasons five and six, hence the actress legally changed her full name to Courteney Cox Arquette. The opening credits of the season six premiere [...] "The One After Vegas" [...] {{features}} an inside joke in which Cox's new surname [...] "Arquette" [...] {{is attached to the}} surnames of each cast and crew member. The episode is dedicated to Cox and Arquette, reading, [...] "For Courteney and David, who did get married." [...] Before marrying Cox, Arquette had guest starred in an episode of Friends as Phoebe's love interest. During season 10, Cox got pregnant with her and Arquette's child. At that same time, her character and on-screen husband were going through the process of adopting a child. Like Monica and Chandler, Cox and Arquette had also struggled with conceiving in real life. Although Kudrow's real-life pregnancy had successfully been written into the show, the same could not have been done for Cox because Friends had already long-established <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> is incapable of having children. Therefore, the crew attempted to conceal Cox's pregnancy using a combination of baggy, loose-fitting costumes and props instead. However, at times the actress' growing belly was still detectable by viewers in spite of the crew's best efforts.|$|E
500|$|A dress {{rehearsal}} {{was held on}} May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> did not care enough about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as [...] "a slut". Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, and surveyed the other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, {{they had to take}} NBC's considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica's lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene [...] "smart and subtler". They sought to protect other parts of the script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot's three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the [...] "Mr. Potato Head" [...] line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3.|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{very strong}} will, the {{character}} tends to exhibit outstanding perseverance {{when it comes to}} what she expects out of her relationships, jobs, and life in general, oftentimes refusing to settle for anything less than what satisfies her. Early in the series, Monica develops a reputation for experiencing bad luck and encountering rather unfortunate circumstances when it comes to dating, romantic relationships, and her love life. Nick at Nite joked that the character [...] "likes to keep things tidy in her home and love life, although the latter is a bit more difficult." [...] This motif is frequently explored as a source of comic relief; the character's friends would often [...] "pick apart" [...] her new dates and boyfriends. In his review of the series, David Hiltbrand of People referred to the character as [...] "an unlucky-in-love codependent," [...] while the Chicago Tribunes Ken Parish Perkins observed <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> [...] "often misfires when shooting for Mr. Right." [...] According to Mike D'Avria of Splitsider, Monica [...] "never shied away from jumping into the sac with both random guys and people she worked with" [...] – among them a high school senior, an old high school crush, and an alcoholic – prior to dating Chandler, and of the show's six main characters maintains the highest total of serious relationships. Cox described Monica as goofy, angry, and sarcastic, while referring to her as the show's most sexually active character despite her [...] "goody two shoes" [...] image.|$|E

500|$|Identified by Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog as [...] "the {{epitome of}} a ... control freak", Refinery29's Kelsey Miller {{summarized}} Monica's personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica {{is known for}} being a [...] "neat freak" [...] obsessed with cleanliness – {{especially when it comes}} to maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica's neuroses until the show's first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel, author Cheryl St. John wrote <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James Tison of Bustle wrote that Monica's cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being [...] "the lame one" [...] among her friends, although [...] "she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important". However, the Los Angeles Timess Steve Weinstein observed that Monica's actions often tend to contradict her [...] "Miss Perfect" [...] image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently [...] "makes a fool of herself" [...] in addition to being [...] "so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends' messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles." [...] Although several of Monica's personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as [...] "quirky and amusing" [...] as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.|$|E
500|$|Monica has a {{complicated}} {{relationship with her}} parents Jack (Elliot Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles), more-so with her mother. Entertainment Weekly referred to the character's relationship with her parents as [...] "esteem-sucking." [...] In fact, the majority of Friends main characters have [...] "strained relationships" [...] with their parents. Described as [...] "hypercritical," [...] Judy enjoys constantly criticizing her daughter's appearance, career, and love life, while acting much kinder towards her son, who she favors. Chelsea Mize of Bustle wrote <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> and Ross' [...] "wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents." [...] Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica's competitiveness originates from having grown up with Ross as a brother, against whom she often competed as a child. Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross' relationship as [...] "A blend of love and sibling jealousy with an urge to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence", with Ross often making fun of his sister's weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, Television's Changing Image of American Jews categorized Monica as a [...] "masked" [...] Jew, explaining that [...] "the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish" [...] than Monica, who the author dismissed as [...] "china-doll like" [...] in appearance and demeanor. In his book Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1, author Stephen Harlan Norwood agrees that, unlike the show's male Jews, Monica's Jewish [...] "markers" [...] have been virtually removed.|$|E
500|$|Each main {{cast member}} auditioned for Friends having had {{some degree of}} prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in Friends, Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her {{physical}} appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as Family Ties and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Los Angeles Times Steve Weinstein believes <b>that</b> <b>Monica</b> {{was the first major}} role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom The Trouble With Larry, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who [...] "was the funny one", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for Friends following its cancellation. When Friends premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star, despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote Friends as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team. As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her [...] "If I could do anything funnier". Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.|$|E

500|$|When Friends premiered in September 1994, critics {{initially}} perceived Monica as the show's main character; Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker attributes this to {{the fact}} that Cox was the show's most famous cast member at the time.

Tony Scott of Variety commended the entire cast for [...] "appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills ... especially Cox", while The Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik described her acting as [...] "terrific".
