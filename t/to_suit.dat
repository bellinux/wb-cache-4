5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> French tastes.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front.|$|E

These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the different operating environment.|$|E

In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.|$|E
5|$|Many camouflaged textile {{patterns}} {{have been}} developed <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the need to match combat clothing to different kinds of terrain (such as woodland, snow, and desert). The design of a pattern effective in all terrains has proved elusive. The American Universal Camouflage Pattern of 2004 attempted <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> all environments, but was withdrawn {{after a few years}} of service. Terrain-specific patterns have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains. The problem of making a pattern that works at different ranges has been solved with pixellated shapes, often designed digitally, that provide a fractal-like range of patch sizes so they appear disruptively coloured both at close range and at a distance. The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian CADPAT, issued to the army in 2002, soon followed by the American MARPAT. A pixellated appearance is not essential for this effect, though it is simpler to design and to print.|$|E

5|$|ATP synthase, {{also called}} complex V, {{is the final}} enzyme in the {{oxidative}} phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions {{in the same way}} in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> different conditions.|$|E

Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with many former homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. There remains a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E
