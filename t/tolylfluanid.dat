50|$|The {{issue is}} {{specifically}} addressed in major regulatory frameworks. In Europe, for instance, “nonrelevant” metabolites are distinguished from metabolites that are “relevant for groundwater resources” or even “ecotoxicologically relevant”. The latter are those whose risk to soil or aquatic biota is comparable or {{higher than the}} parent and must meet the same standards as their parent. Groundwater-relevant metabolites are those likely to reach groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 μg/liter and to display the same toxicity as the parent compound. In the past toxicology issues typically emerged only decades after market introduction. Examples are the detection of chloridazon products (first marketed in 1964) in surface and groundwater, or <b>tolylfluanid</b> (first marketed in 1971). That these substances were overlooked for so long may partially be attributable to prior limits on analytical capabilities. However, labeling some metabolites as nonrelevant may have resulted in directing attention away from them. The decision to tolerate up to 10 μg/liter of “nonrelevant” metabolites in groundwater and drinking water is politically highly contentious in Europe. Some consider the higher limit acceptable as no imminent health risk can be proven, whereas others regard it as a fundamental deviation from the precautionary principle.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} European Concerted Action on Male Reproduction Capability an {{exposure}} assessment survey was conducted among seasonal workers in the fruit growing sector in the Netherlands. Dermal exposure to the fungicides captan and <b>tolylfluanid</b> was measured using cotton gloves (12 persons) and skin pads on several body parts (12 persons). In addition, a set of exposure data was used from a study conducted recently among Dutch fruit growers. For harvesting activities, re-entry time {{appeared to be an}} important determinant of dermal exposure to captan and <b>tolylfluanid.</b> Explained variance of regression models was moderate to high (range 0. 30 - 0. 87). For captan, calculated half-life times from the most recent exposure survey were lower (glove data: 5 days; pad data: 6 days) compared with half-life times based on the previously conducted study (11 days). Possible explanations for the discrepancy are discussed. For <b>tolylfluanid,</b> estimated half-life times during harvesting were 2 and 3 days, based on pad and glove data, respectively. Prediction of captan exposure during other crop activities appeared to be far more difficult (explained variance equal to 0. 06), although the estimated half-life time was comparable with that for harvesting. The data suggest that re-entry time gives useful information to group workers in broad exposure categories. Nonetheless, it was concluded that large studies are needed to evaluate the importance of re-entry time in more detail...|$|E

Yeast composition of fungicide-treated and untreated young apple fruit with or without russet symptoms was investigated and enzyme activity of the yeasts was studied. Cryptococcus albidus, C. laurentii,Rhodotorula glutinis, Sporobolomyces roseus andMetschnikowia pulcherrima dominated the apple fruit surface. Russeted apple fruitlets had a higher red yeast density than non-russeted fruitlets. Invitro fungicide susceptibility of the dominant yeast species varied. Dithianon and dodine were active against all tested species, captan and <b>tolylfluanid</b> showed specificity for certain species, whereas pyrimethanil and bupirimate were largely ineffective. Fungicide treatment in the field had a clear effect on the yeast composition. Metschnikowia etschnikowia pulcherrima was eliminated from the phyllosphere and cryptococco$ï species diminished by both captan and dithianon.

Euparen Multi was daily administered per os to female mice (ICR strain) at four different doses of 118, 294, 588 and 1177 mg/kg b. m., beginning on day 1 of pregnancy. Embryos obtained on day 4 of pregnancy were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide, Calcein AM), and the number of nuclei, blastocyst formation, distribution of embryos according to the nucleus number and cell death incidence were determined. Embryos in the experimental groups (except for the lowest dose 118 mg/kg b. m.) showed a highly significant dose-dependent reduction in total cell numbers corresponding to the lower proportion of blastocysts. The occurrence of cell death was significantly increased in all experimental groups, indicating that Euparen Multi is able to cause cell death at relatively low doses.

Within three years, {{as a consequence of the}} infestation, some cultivars showed symptoms of poor growth, in isolated cases the plants died. Control of irises against this pathogen has not yet been satisfactorily solved. At the present time no fungicides against B. convolute have been re­gis­te­red, only fungicides protecting ornamental plants against Botrytis cinerea. We explored the effect of seven active substances – captan, carbendazim, fenhexamid, iprodione, mancozeb, pyrimethanil and <b>tolylfluanid</b> (in vitro) in four different concentrations on the growth of the mycelia, germination of conidia and sklerotia. We evaluated the germination of B. convoluta conidia over 24 and 48 hours, my­ce­lium growth and germination of sclerotia over 5 days. In control plants the germination capacity of conidia over 48 hours reached 98 – 99 [*]%. Over 24 hours all the tested concentrations of preparations containing the active substances <b>tolylfluanid</b> and captan markedly affected the germination of conidia; their effectiveness ranged between 88 and 100 [*]%. All the active substances in the registered concentration (mancozeb 0. 2 [*]%, tolylfluanids 0. 2 [*]%, carbendazim 0. 2 [*]%, pyrimethanil 0. 25 [*]%, ipro­dio­ne 0. 3 [*]%, fenhexamid 0. 15 [*]% and captan 1 [*]%) prevented, or considerably reduced, the growth of B. convoluta mycelia (98. 8 – 100 [*]%).

40|$|International audienceAntifouling (AF) paints {{are used}} to prevent the {{attachment}} of living organisms to the submerged surfaces of ships, boats and aquatic structures, usually by the release of biocides. Apart from copper, organic booster biocides are the main active components in AF paints, but their use can {{have a negative impact}} on the marine environment. The direct effects of biocides on marine bacteria are poorly known. This work investigates the impact of two biocides, viz. diuron and <b>tolylfluanid,</b> on the growth and the viability of marine microorganisms and on their ability to form biofilms. The biocides in solution were found to inhibit growth of two strains of marine bacteria, viz. Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio vulnificus, at a high concentration (1000 microg ml(- 1)), but only a small effect on viability was observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the booster biocides decreased biofilm formation by both bacteria. At a concentration of 10 microg ml(- 1), the biocides inhibited cell attachment and reduced biofilm thickness on glass surfaces. The percentage of live cells in the biofilms was also reduced. The effect of the biocides on two diatoms, Fragilaria pinnata and Cylindrotheca closterium, was also evaluated in terms of growth rate, biomass, chlorophyll a content and attachment to glass.

The {{principle of the}} method was homogenisation of the apples, extraction with ammonium acetate–acetic acid solution in methanol–water by ultrasonication, filtration and determination by LC-MS/MS. The repeatability and within laboratory reproducibility for the three spiking levels 0. 02, 0. 04 and 0. 2 mg kg− 1 were between 4 - 35 %. In general, the repeatability and reproducibility were about 10 – 20 %. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 0. 01 - 0. 14 mg kg- 1. The method was used on incurred samples from parts of the ISAFRUIT project financed by the European Commission under the 6 th framework. Samples were analysed at four different stages, after harvest, after storage (controlled), after water bath and after 28 days at room temperature. Pesticide residues were found at all stages, but {{no significant differences in}} the concentration were seen between the stages analysed. Only for <b>tolylfluanid</b> storage at room temperature in 28 days decreased the concentration significantly, only 0 - 6 % of the original amount of <b>tolylfluanid</b> remained in the apples..

The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality of papaya seeds treated with fungicides and stored under two environmental and packaging conditions. Additionally, the efficiency of fungicide treatments in the control of damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani was evaluated. Papaya seeds were treated with the fungicides Captan, <b>Tolylfluanid</b> and the mixture <b>Tolylfluanid</b> + Captan (all commercial wettable powder formulations). Seeds of the control group were not treated. The seeds were stored for nine months in two conditions: packed in aluminum coated paper and kept at 7 ± 1 °C and in permeable kraft paper and kept in non-controlled environment. At {{the beginning of the}} storage and every three months the seed quality (germination and vigor tests), emergence rate index, height, dry mass and damping of plants in pre and post-emergence (in contaminated substrate and mycelia-free substrate) were analyzed. Both storage conditions as well as the fungicide treatments preserved the germination and seed vigor. In the infested substrate, seedling emergence was favored by fungicides, but in post-emergence, fungicides alone did not control the damping off caused by R. solani. Symptoms of damping off were not observed in the clean substrate.

The overall {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the possibility of biological control and to find naturally occurring needle fungi with biosuppressive activity against grey mould on conifer seedlings in Swedish forest nurseries. The potential of biological control was demonstrated by means of the microbial products Binab, GlioMix and Mycostop. These products reduced B. cinerea infections in Scots pine seedlings by 16 to 57 % in a field trial at a Swedish forest nursery, and by 51 to 94 % in growth room assays under controlled climatic conditions. The effect of BinabÒ and GlioMixÒ was of the same level as the fungicide <b>tolylfluanid.</b> A novel microcosm bioassay was developed to evaluate microorganisms for biocontrol of B. cinerea in co-inoculation tests on three-week-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings. Pre-inoculation treatment by incubation at 40 °C for five hours predisposed seedlings to infection by B. cinerea. Different isolates of needle fungi were low to highly effective in suppression of B. cinerea. One of these isolates was identified as a Fusarium sp. strain F 31 and was shown to secrete a spectrum of enniatins in liquid medium. Two new enniatins, J 2 and J 3, were co-isolated. Inhibitory activity to spore germination of B. cinerea was shown for the enniatins B, B 1, B 4 and K 1. Based on the screening tests, nine fungal isolates were selected and evaluated for their efficacy to suppress spontaneous infections by B. cinerea in first-year Scots pine seedlings in a small-scale field experiment. Two isolates of Trichoderma sp. and the fungicide <b>tolylfluanid</b> showed some degree of control. The impact of the tested control agents on the community structure of needle-inhabiting fungi was analysed.

Diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol, and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol were identified in Directive 2013 / 39 /EU for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been tasked with proposing seven substances as candidates for the completion of the 1 st Watch List and identifying analytical methods for their monitoring. The procedure and criteria used to identify a short-list of substances for possible inclusion in the Watch List is described in the JRC Science and Policy Report “Development of the 1 st Watch List under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive" (Carvalho et al., 2015). EU Member States and stakeholder groups had the opportunity to comment on the proposed substances and on the analytical methods, whose availability was a criterion for the selection of the compounds. The finally proposed 10 (groups of) substances for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List are diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), oxadiazon, methiocarb, 2, 6 -ditert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, tri-allate, neonicotinoid insecticides as a group (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), and 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -methoxycinnamate. Analytical methods for additional substances were searched and investigated because they were among those considered for inclusion in the list, but either did not fulfil all selection criteria, in some cases because enough monitoring data were found to exist already, or were not ranked highly enough. These substances were trichlorfon, cyclododecane, aminotriazole (amitrole), dimethenamid-P, diflufenican, dichlofluanid, formaldehyde, triphenyl phosphate, <b>tolylfluanid,</b> ciprofloxacin, and free cyanide.

Models describing the prediction of volatility and potential fate of these substances in the environment have become an important tool in the pesticide authorisation procedure at the EU level. The main topic {{of this research is}} to assess the rate and extent of volatilisation of ten pesticides after application on field crops. RESULTS: For eight of the ten pesticides, the volatilisation rates modelled with PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales) corresponded well to the calculated rates modelled with ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System). For the other pesticides, large {{differences were found between the}} models. Formulation might affect the volatilisation potential of pesticides. Increased leaf wetness increased the volatilisation of propyzamide and trifloxystrobin at the end of the field trial. The reliability of pesticide input parameters, in particular the vapour pressure, is discussed.

The comparison of average IC 50 values of cell cultures revealed that the most sensitive cell lines were PK 15 (IC 50 = 10 – 3. 27 M) and RK 13 (IC 50 = 10 – 3. 21 M), whereas MDBK (IC 50 = 10 – 2. 55 M) and BEPC (IC 50 = 10 – 2. 52 M) were less sensitive to pesticide exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{fungicide}} Euparen Multi (containing 50 % <b>tolylfluanid)</b> was investigated on the induction of chromosomal aberrations (CA) in cultured bovine peripheral lymphocytes. Cultures from two healthy donors were treated with tolylfluanid-based fungicide at concentrations ranging from 1. 7 to 17. 5 μg/ml for the last 24 and 48 hours of cultivation. Conventional cytogenetic method (CA assay) with Giemsa staining as well as {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with whole bovine chromosomes 1 and 5 painting probes were used in the experiment. In the CA assay, no clastogenic {{effect of the}} fungicide was found after Euparen Multi treatment for 24 hours. On the contrary, significant elevation in polyploidy induction was observed with dose-dependence in one of the donors. Using prolonged time of exposure to the fungicide (the last 48 h of the cultivation), a slight clastogenic effect was detected at the doses of 8. 75 and 17. 5 μg/ml (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01, respectively) in donor 1 and at the dose of 8. 75 μg/ml (P < 0. 05) in donor 2. The highest doses tested caused reduction of the mitotic indices (MI) (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01) in both donors as well as both treatment times. The evaluation of stable structural aberrations in lymphocytes by two-colour FISH (48 h exposure) using bovine chromosome painting probes revealed the presence of nonreciprocal translocations at two examined concentrations (3. 5 μg/ml and 8. 75 μg/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmerging {{data suggest}} that {{environmental}} endocrine disrupting chemicals {{may contribute to the}} pathophysiology of obesity and diabetes. In a prior work, the phenylsulfamide fungicide <b>tolylfluanid</b> (TF) was shown to augment adipocyte differentiation, yet its effects on mature adipocyte metabolism remain unknown. Because of the central role of adipose tissue in global energy regulation, the present study tested the hypothesis that TF modulates insulin action in primary rodent and human adipocytes. Alterations in insulin signaling in primary mammalian adipocytes were determined by the phosphorylation of Akt, a critical insulin signaling intermediate. Treatment of primary murine adipose tissue in vitro with 100 nM TF for 48 h markedly attenuated acute insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a strain- and species-independent fashion. Perigonadal, perirenal, and mesenteric fat were all sensitive to TF-induced insulin resistance. A similar TF-induced reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was observed in primary human subcutaneous adipose tissue. TF treatment led to a potent and specific reduction in insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS- 1) mRNA and protein levels, a key upstream mediator of insulin's diverse metabolic effects. In contrast, insulin receptor-β, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, and Akt expression were unchanged, indicating a specific abrogation of insulin signaling. Additionally, TF-treated adipocytes exhibited altered endocrine function with a reduction in both basal and insulin-stimulated leptin secretion. These studies demonstrate that TF induces cellular insulin resistance in primary murine and human adipocytes through a reduction of IRS- 1 expression and protein stability, raising concern about the potential for this fungicide to disrupt metabolism and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} variables on larval metamorphosis of the solitary ascidian Ciona savignyi were investigated in a laboratory setting. The progression of metamorphic changes were tracked under various temperature, photoperiod, substrate, larval density, and vessel size regimes. Metamorphosis was maximised at 18 °C, 12 : 12 h subdued light:dark, smooth polystyrene substrate, and 10 larvae mL− 1 in a twelve-well tissue culture plate. Eliminating the air-water interface by filling culture vessels to capacity further increased the proportion of metamorphosed larvae; 87 ± 5 % of larvae completed metamorphosis within 5 days compared to 45 ± 5 % in control wells. The effects of the reference antifouling compounds polygodial, portimine, oroidin, chlorothalonil, and <b>tolylfluanid</b> on C. savignyi were subsequently determined, highlighting (1) the sensitivity of C. savignyi metamorphosis to chemical exposure and (2) the potential to use C. savignyi larvae to screen for bioactivity in an optimised laboratory setting. The compounds were bioactive in the low ng mL− 1 to high µg mL− 1 range. Polygodial was chosen for additional investigations, where it was shown that mean reductions in the proportions of larvae reaching stage E were highly repeatable both within (repeatability = 14 ± 9 %) and between (intermediate precision = 17 ± 3 %) independent experiments. An environmental extract {{had no effect on}} the larvae but exposing larvae to both the extract and polygodial reduced potency relative to polygodial alone. This change in potency stresses the need for caution when working with complex samples, as is routinely implemented when isolating natural compounds from their biological source. Overall, the outcomes of this study highlight the sensitivity of C. savignyi metamorphosis to environmental variations and chemical exposure...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{environmental}} pollutants {{were examined}} for their {{interaction with the}} glucocorticoid hormone system. The focus was placed on interference with the glucocorticoid synthesis and the glucocorticoid-signalling pathway in various in vitro test systems. Several aryl methyl sulphones competitively inhibited CYP 11 B 1 activity in mouse adrenocortical Y 1 cells. The DDT metabolite, 3 -methylsulphonyl- 2, 2 ’-bis(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 ’-dichloroethene (3 -MeSO 2 -DDE) had a higher affinity to the enzyme than the endogenous substrate, 11 -deoxycorticosterone. In fact, 3 -MeSO 2 -DDE (Ki 1. 6 μM) was almost as potent as the drug metyrapone (Ki 0. 8 μM), a well-known inhibitor of the enzyme. 3 -MeSO 2 -DDE inhibited CYP 11 B 1 activity in human adrenocortical H 295 R carcinoma cells, and at higher concentrations the CYP 21 activity. The human H 295 R cell line {{seems to be a}} useful test system for studies of enzyme activities and could be used to screen endocrine disrupting chemicals interfering with the glucocorticoid hormone synthesis. Several chiral PCB methyl sulphones and the fungicide <b>tolylfluanid</b> proved to be antagonists to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in rat hepatoma cells and/or Chinese hamster ovary cells stable transformed with a human GR and a responsive reporter vector. The 4 -methylsulphonyl- 2, 3, 6, 2 ’, 4 ’, 5 ’-hexachlorobiphenyl (4 -MeSO 2 -CB 149) enantiomers had similar antagonistic effect on the GR. Co-exposure of substances led to additive inhibitory effects on glucocorticoid-regulated protein synthesis in rat hepatoma cells. In general, 4 -substituted but not 3 -substituted methylsulphonyl-PCBs interacted with the glucocorticoid hormone system. In the environment, humans and wildlife are constantly exposed {{to a wide range of}} chemicals. Considering the effects of these substances via mechanisms of actions described in this thesis, interference of xenobiotics with the glucocorticoid hormone system deserves further attention. In conclusion, environmental pollutants can interact with the glucocorticoid hormone system in vitro, yet the effects of the tested substances on this hormone system remain to be established in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Protea scab, {{a commercially}} {{important}} disease of Protea spp., is discernable by raised, circular to oval, red â€“ black leaf and stem lesions, which distort young plant growth. The causal agent {{was determined to}} be Sphaceloma protearum (Teleomorph ElsinoÃ« spp.). Erumpent conidophores and acervuli in diseased tissue were characteristic of the Loculoascomycete ElsinoÃ«. The teleomorph state was rarely observed. Ascospores were hyaline, ellipsoid, 4 transversely septate, 0 - 1 vertical septa, 11 - 13 (- 16) x 4 - 5 Î¼m. Elliptical, aseptate, hyaline conidia were obtained in vitro in Friesâ€™s medium. S. protearum is an extremely slow growing fungus, 2 - 5 mm in 14 days on malt extract agar (MEA) at 25 ÂºC and 32 - 90 % relative humidity (optimum growth conditions). Maximum cardinal temperature was below 30 ÂºC. Colonies were irregular, raised and convoluted, with smooth colony margin, red-brown in colour and released a red pigment into the agar. Chlorothalonil, at 1000 ppm, was added to MEA to control growth of contaminants. It had no effect on S. protearum growth. Protea compacta x susannae cv Pink Ice developed typical disease symptoms 3 to 4 weeks after inoculation by insertion of a mycelium plug into stem tissue, from which S. protearum was re-isolated. Additional hosts not previously recorded were: P. grandiceps x eximia cv Rosie, P. compacta x burchellii cv Brenda, P. longifolia cv Satin Pink, P. compacta x obtusifolia cv Red Baron, P. repens cv Guerna, P. laurifolia cv Regal Mink, P. neriifolia cv Silvertips and P. F 2 hybrid cv Niobe. The pathogen over-wintered in old scab lesions as ascospores and / or resting mycelium. Infection was by wind and water dispersed propagules. Plants under stress, such as lack of water, were particularly susceptible to infection. In vitro fungicide trials of 3 isolates revealed that EC 50 for mycelial growth was below the 100 % inhibition level of the recommended field concentration (IRC) for captan and prochloraz (all isolates), mancozeb (isolate J 24) and azoxystrobin (isolate D 01). <b>Tolylfluanid</b> offered no protection against S. protearum. In the field good control of protea scab on P. cv Pink Ice was obtained with azoxystrobin (250 mg/l) and prochloraz (500 mg/l), with AUDPC of 1. 39 and 1. 43 respectively. This was followed by the positive control (1. 84), mancozeb (1. 96) and lastly [captan + benlate] (2. 06). Plants should be sprayed when actively growing, and during hot, moist weather conditions (20 - 27 ÂºC, 45 - 90 % humidity). Cultural methods are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|From an {{environmental}} perspective, {{there is a}} need to reduce the amount of biocides from antifouling paints in the marine ecosystem as these biocides can exert a negative effect on the marine life. One way to do this is to optimize the use of biocides in antifouling paints, and thereby avoid unnecessary overdosing. This thesis has been produced within the research program Marine Paint which has the overall aim to produce an antifouling paint with a lower environmental impact than the paints existing on the market today. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis has been to evaluate the efficacy and ecotoxicity of eight antifouling biocides to both target and non-target organisms. The biocides investigated were: medetomidine, triphenylborane pyridine (TPBP), <b>tolylfluanid,</b> copper, irgarol, zinc pyrithione, copper pyrithione and 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl 3 (2 H) -isothiazolone (DCOIT). The target organisms investigated were the macroalga Ulva lactuca and periphyton (i. e. microbial communities). It is important to keep in mind that all target organisms that antifouling biocides are meant to affect, are also non-target organisms when they grow on natural substrates in the marine ecosystem. Therefore, effects on target organisms are not only of interest for efficacy evaluations, but also for ecotoxicological assessments of the biocides. Both the efficacy and ecotoxicity of the eight biocides has been evaluated for the target organisms in settlement assays in which the organisms were allowed to settle and grow in the presence of the biocides. Full concentration-response curves from 0 to 100 % effect were produced to enable future mixture predictions. Such mixture predictions can be used for paint optimization, but also in environmental applications such as hazard assessments. Copper pyrithione was the biocide that most efficiently prevented growth of both Ulva lactuca and periphyton communities, and for Ulva lactuca is was also the biocide with the highest ecotoxicity. Due to different shapes of the concentration-response curves, the toxicity ranking was not consistent at all effect levels (from EC 10 to EC 98), and irgarol was found to be more toxic to periphyton at lower concentrations than copper pyrithione. In order to extend the ecotoxicological evaluations of the biocides beyond target organisms, effects on the non-target organism Acartia tonsa was investigated. Acartia tonsa is one of the most commonly occurring pelagic calanoid copepods in coastal waters world-wide. Effects on mortality and egg production were studied for three of the eight biocides, namely DCOIT, TPBP and medetomidine. It was shown that neither DCOIT nor medetomidine affected the egg production specifically, but inhibition of egg production occurred at the same concentration as mortality. TPBP was on the other hand shown to affect the egg production at concentrations lower than lethal concentrations. Antifouling biocides present in the marine environment can exert selection pressure on marine life and through the process of natural selection induce tolerance development. An extreme tolerance to the antifouling biocide irgarol in a population of Ulva lactuca from the mouth of the Gullmar fjord has been described. This indicates that the use of antifouling paints has made its imprint on the marine ecosystem. The results from this thesis have deepened the understanding of the biological effects of antifouling biocides. The well-defined concentration-response curves gives information on both efficacy and ecotoxicity, and the information can be used in a number of applications where either biocidal efficacy or ecotoxicity is of interest, such as hazard assessments and in the design of antifouling paints...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} fruit rot, caused by Didymella bryoniae, in glasshouse cucumbers in the Netherlands {{gave rise to}} a study of the biology of the pathogen, the epidemiology of the disease, and control methods. Stems, leaves and growing tips may be attacked, and fruits may be infected internally as well as externally. Internal infection of fruits starts at the blossom end and is initially hard to observe externally. With external fruit rot, lesions occur on any place of the fruit, predominantly in the post harvest period. The survival of the fungus outdoors and in glasshouses was studied. Outdoors, the fungus was able to survive winters with 14 days of frost. A temperature above 5 °C was needed for growth and fructification of the fungus. Diseased plant residues remained an infection source {{as long as they were}} not decomposed. Deliberate introduction of diseased plant debris in the glasshouse caused an earlier appearance of symptoms, and increased the severity of the disease. Hygienic measures are advised to eliminate infection sources. The number of daily trapped ascospores showed a peak after sunset, both outdoors near diseased plant debris and in glasshouses with diseased plants. Watering the plants in the glasshouse favoured ascospore release. Under controlled environmental conditions, ascospores were not released at a high relative humidity or after a change in relative humidity. They could only be trapped after wetting of the substrate. The first ascospores in glasshouses were trapped at about the same time the first symptoms on the plants appeared. Wounding was essential to achieve external fruit rot. The degree of rot was increased by more severe wounding. The rotting of the fruits increased progressively from 12 to 23 °C; it decreased at higher temperatures and no rot at all occurred at 35 °C. To reduce rotting without diminishing the shelf life, fruits have to be stored at 12 °C in the post harvest period. Relative humidity during storage had no effect on fruit decay. A low nitrogen fertilization of the crop decreased the degree of fruit rot but reduced also the production. The difference in fruit rot in the light and in the dark had no practical significance. Internal fruit rot was achieved by inoculation of the open flower; however, the majority of the fruits escaped infection. It took more than two days for the fungus to reach the fruit after infection of the style. Neither the method of inoculation, nor amending nutrients to the inoculum suspension influenced the incidence of internal fruit rot. Slight wounding by removing parts of the flower had no effect on the incidence of internal fruit rot, whereas severe wounding by blossom excision reduced it with 75 %. Inoculation of wilted flowers resulted in 60 % less infection than inoculation of fresh flowers. Some powdery mildew resistant cultivars showed resistance to internal fruit infection. This resistance was associated with a long style and a short flowering period. However, no obvious effect of the flowering period within a cultivar on the incidence of internal fruit rot was observed. Growing plants under drought stress markedly increased internal fruit infection. Duration of fruit growth and fruit thinning had no effect on fruit infection. Relative humidity had no effect either. For flower infection no free water seems to be needed. It is not yet clear whether some kind of defence mechanism to fruit infection existst from which the fungus may escape under certain circumstances. Under controlled environmental conditions infection of growing tips and leaves was rare at 60 % r. h., it increased at 95 % r. h. and was most serious if the plants were kept wet. A period of 1 hour of free water was sufficient for the initial stage of infection. For further expansion of the disease, leaf wetness was required. A high relative humidity did not predispose leaves to infection. Wounding was essential for infection of older leaves, but not for infection of young plant tissue. A higher conidial concentration increased infection. The effect of leaf wetting on the number of infected sites was comparable with the effect of a tenfold conidial concentration. In glasshouses with cucumbers grown in a commercial way, a lower night temperature in the pre-inoculation period, between 12 and 24 °C, increased the disease incidence later on in the season, whereas no postponed effect of the day temperature, between 17 and 26 °C, was observed. The daily maximum relative humidity was about 10 % lower in glasshouse compartments with a minimum ventilator opening than in compartments without a minimum ventilator opening. This decreased the disease incidence on uninoculated plants to 35 % and on fruits to 40 %. The spread of the disease from inoculated plants to uninoculated ones was more rapid under humid than under drier conditions. However, production was higher under more humid conditions. Disease incidence was higher at an interval of 5 °C between heating and ventilation than at an interval of 2 °C. Little ventilation with an electric fan at an interval of 5 °C between heating and ventilation hardly influenced the incidence of the disease. The influence of transition to day temperature 3 h before, 1 h before, 1 h after and 3 h after sunrise on the incidence of the disease was studied. The later the transition to day temperature took place, the longer the periods with high relative humidity were maintained, the longer the periods the fruits stayed wet by condensation of water and the higher the incidence of the disease on inoculated plants and fruits was. Inoculation of plants resulted in a high infection pressure and in an increase of the disease incidence on plants and fruits as well as in an increase of the number of misshapen fruits. Inoculation reduced the number of internodes by 18 % after four weeks and the number of fruits by 10 %. The male and female flowering cultivar Spotvrije was as susceptible to stem and fruit rot as the female flowering hybrid Farbio. The tested breeding material showed plant resistance, both in the young and mature stage, and resistance to external fruit rot if the fruits were slightly wounded. Resistance to internal fruit rot was not observed. Not always a correlation was found between the activities of fungicides in vitro and in vivo. Testing fungicides on young inoculated plants under humid conditions was a reliable method. Best control was obtained with benzimidazole fungicides, <b>tolylfluanid</b> and chlorothalonil. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, used to control powdery mildew, and dicarboximides, used to control Botrytis, gave also some control of D. bryoniae. Frequent, preferably weekly sprays were necessary to obtain a reasonable effect. The disease has to he controlled by a combination of hygienic measures, chemical control and manipulation of the glasshouse environment, especially by preventing humid conditions. A contribution of resistance breeding is expected in the future...|$|E
