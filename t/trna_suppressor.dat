40|$|Ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) {{exist in}} yeast {{both as a}} single {{chromosomal}} array of tandemly repeated units and as extrachromosomal units named 3 um plasmids, although {{the relationship between these}} two forms is unclear. Inheritance of rDNA was studied using two systems. The first used a naturally occuring rDNA restriction enzyme polymorphism between two strains to distinguish between their rDNA arrays, and the second involved cloning a <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> gene into rDNA to label individual rDNA units. An added interest {{to the study of the}} inheritance of rDNA in yeast was the possible association between it and the inheritance of the Psi factor, an enigmatic type of nonsense suppressor in yeast which shows extra-chromosomal inheritance. In a cross heterozygous for the rDNA polymorphism and the psi factor, tetrad analysis suggested that the psi factor had segregated 4 : 0. The majority of the rDNA units segregated in a 2 : 2 fashion, which suggested that reciprocal recombination in the rDNA of psi + diploids is heavily suppressed as was previously shown for psi - diploids. A heterologous plasmid containing the <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> gene was constructed and transformed into haploid and diploid hosts. A series of transformants was obtained and physical and genetic analysis suggested that they contained <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> gene(s) integrated into their rDNA. In a cross heterozygous for rDNA-tRNA gene insert(s), 6 % of the tetrads dissected showed a meiotic segregation of the suppressed phenotype which could most probably be accounted for by inter-chromosomal gene conversion. This observation could be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, recombination intermediates between rDNA on homologues may occur in meiosis, but they are mostly resolved as gene conversions without reciprocal cross-over. Alternatively, gene conversion tracts in rDNA are rare but very long so that the tRNA gene insert was always included in the event. 3 um rDNA plasmids containing the tRNA gene marker were not detected in any of the transformants analysed. An extensive quantitative analysis of the rate of reversion of the suppressed phenotype amongst these transformants identified a particulary unstable transformant group. It was proposed that the mechanism of reversion was loss of the tRNA gene insert by unequal sisterstrand exchange, and the mechanism was shown to be independent of the recombination/repair genes RAD 1, RAD 52, and RAD 51. A genetic analysis of stability suggested that there may have been at least two loci segregating in the host strains with additive effects on stability. </p...|$|E

We show that amber, ochre and opal <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs,</b> derived from Escherichia coli glutamine tRNA, suppress UAG, UAA and UGA termination codons, respectively, in a reporter mRNA in mammalian cells. Activity of each <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> is dependent upon the expression of E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, indicating that none of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> are aminoacylated by any of the twenty aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the mammalian cytoplasm. Amber, ochre and opal <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> {{with a wide range of}} activities in suppression (increases of up to 36, 156 and 200 -fold, respectively) have been generated by introducing further mutations into the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> genes. The most active <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> have been used in combination to concomitantly suppress two or three termination codons in an mRNA.

We isolated the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene, trm 1, encoding the tRNA N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine- 26 methyltransferase. Strains having the gene deleted completely lack N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine. In strains carrying the weak ochre <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> sup 3 -i, deletion of trm 1 abolishes suppression indicating that the trm 1 deletion acts as an antisuppressor mutation.

Secondly, both an increase {{and a decrease in}} the efficiency of the suppressor tRNA were induced by the mutations. This is the first report that rRNA mutations decreased the efficiency of a suppressor tRNA.

40|$|Amber {{mutations}} {{have been}} isolated and mapped {{to more than}} 60 sites in gene 9 of P 22 encoding the thermostable phage tailspike protein. Gene 9 is the locus of over 30 sites of temperature sensitive folding (tsf) mutations, which affect intermediates in the chain folding and subunit association pathway. The phenotypes of the amber missense proteins produced on <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> hosts inserting serine, glutamine, tryosine and leucine have been determined at different temperatures. Thirty-three of the sites are tolerant, producing functional proteins {{with any of the}} four amino acids inserted at the sites, independent of temperature. Tolerant sites are concentrated at the N-terminal end of the protein indicating that this region is not critical for conformation or function. Sixteen of the sites yield temperature sensitive missense proteins on at least one nonsense suppressing host. Most of the sites with ts phenotypes map to the central region of the gene which is also the region where most of the tsf mutations map. Mutations at 15 of the sites have a lethal phenotype on at least one <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> host. For nine out of ten sites tested with at least one lethal phenotype, the primary defect was in the folding or subunit association of the missense polypeptide chain. This analysis of the tailspike missense proteins distinguishes three classes of amino acid sites in the polypeptide chain; residues whose side chains contribute little to folding, subunit assembly or function; residues critical for maintaining the folding and subunit assembly pathway at {{the high end of the}} temperature range of phage growth; and residues critical over the entire temperature range of growth...|$|E

An Escherichia coli strain, carrying an amber mutation in the lac Z gene, produces beta-galactosidase only if the suppressor is present; the aptamer's coexpression in the cell inhibits {{the activity of the}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> Moreover, in E. coli extract, the aptamer partially inhibits the read-through of the stop codon {{on the part of the}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> These results point to a novel strategy that need not be limited to the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> By constructing appropriate inducible aptamers, it may well be possible to effectively control translation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial strains {{carrying}} nonsense <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> genes {{played a}} crucial role in early work on bacterial and bacterial viral genetics. In eukaryotes as well, <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> have played important roles in the genetic analysis of yeast and worms. Surprisingly, little is known about genetic suppression in archaea, and there has been no characterization of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> or identification of nonsense mutations in any of the archaeal genes. Here, we show, using the β-gal gene as a reporter, that amber, ochre, and opal suppressors derived from the serine and tyrosine tRNAs of the archaeon Haloferax volcanii are active in suppression of their corresponding stop codons. Using a promoter for tRNA expression regulated by tryptophan, we also show inducible and regulatable suppression of all three stop codons in H. volcanii. Additionally, transformation of a ΔpyrE 2 H. volcanii strain with plasmids carrying the genes for a pyrE 2 amber mutant and the serine amber <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> yielded transformants that grow on agar plates lacking uracil. Thus, an auxotrophic amber mutation in the pyrE 2 gene can be complemented by expression of the amber <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> These results pave the way for generating archaeal strains carrying inducible <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> genes on the chromosome and their use in archaeal and archaeviral genetics.

40|$|A general {{approach}} to site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in vivo {{would be the}} import into cells of a <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> aminoacylated with the analogue of choice. The analogue would be inserted at any site in the protein specified by a stop codon in the mRNA. The only requirement is that the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> must not be a substrate {{for any of the}} cellular aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases. Here, we describe conditions for the import of amber and ochre <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> derived from Escherichia coli initiator tRNA into mammalian COS 1 cells, and we present evidence for their activity in the specific suppression of amber (UAG) and ochre (UAA) codons, respectively. We show that an aminoacylated amber <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> (supF) derived from the E. coli tyrosine tRNA can be imported into COS 1 cells and acts as a suppressor of amber codons, whereas the same <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> imported without prior aminoacylation does not, suggesting that the supF tRNA is not a substrate for any mammalian aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase. These results open the possibility of using the supF tRNA aminoacylated with an amino acid analogue as a {{general approach}} for the site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in mammalian cells. We discuss the possibility further of importing a mixture of amber and ochre <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> for the insertion of two different amino acid analogues into a protein and the potential use of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> import for treatment of some of the human genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations...|$|R

Thus, the E. coli tyrosine tRNA is functionally a leucine tRNA in yeast cytoplasm. This functional identity may correlate with a structural relationship between the E. coli tyrosine and yeast leucine tRNAs, which are both members of the uncommon type II class of tRNA structures. The results raise the possibility that in evolution a tRNA may be {{more closely related to}} a tRNA of different acceptor specificity, but of the same type class, than to one with the same amino acid specificity, but of a different type class...|$|E

In three of these classes, an adjacent interval surrounded by delta sequences was inverted {{in concert with the}} deletion.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain an insight into the {{pathogenesis}} of mouse muscular dystrophy, we investigated the natural <b>suppressor</b> serine <b>tRNA.</b> The natural <b>suppressor</b> seryl-tRNA was distinguished from the other seryl-tRNAs {{on the basis of}} its specific property of being converted into phosphoseryl-tRNA by a tRNA kinase. On a wet-weight basis, the content of total tRNA in dystrophic muscles was 47 % of that in normal muscles. Although the serine-accepting activities of tRNA were similar in muscles of 3 -month-old dystrophic and normal mice, the ratio of [32 P]phosphoseryl-tRNA (<b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA)</b> to the total serine tRNA was significantly enhanced in dystrophic muscles compared with that in normal muscles. This high content of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> in dystrophic muscles was further confirmed by dot-blot hybridization experiments with the DNA probes CGTAGTCGGCAGGAT and CGCCCGAAAGGTGGAA for major tRNA(IGASer) and <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> respectively. At the early postnatal age of 3 weeks, when only a week had elapsed since the first manifestation of the dystrophic symptom (hindleg dragging), the ratio of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> to major tRNAs in dystrophic hindleg muscles was abnormally increased. Thereafter it decreased with age in normal mice but remained almost unchanged in dystrophic mice. Consequently, at 3 months old, it was 1. 7 times higher in dystrophic than in normal mice. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> is now accepted to play a role in the synthesis of glutathione peroxidase. The present study showed that the content of this enzyme was abnormally elevated in dystrophic mice. Previously we had demonstrated that the docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6) acid content in phospholipids was decreased, possibly resulting from the enhanced oxidative milieu caused by the dystrophic condition. Thus far, the findings suggest that an increase in the contents of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> and glutathione peroxidase in dystrophic muscle may have been secondarily induced by such a highly oxidative state in the dystrophic condition. However, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the natural <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies...|$|R

40|$|Prototrophic mutants {{produced}} by UV light in Escherichia coli K- 12 strains with argE 3 (Oc) and hisG 4 (Oc) defects are distinguished as backmutations and specific nonsense suppressor mutations. In strains carrying a umuC defect, mutants are not produced unless irradiated cells are incubated and then exposed to photoreversing light (delayed photoreversal mutagenesis). The mutants thus produced {{are found to}} be specifically suppressor mutations and not backmutations. The suppressor mutations are primarily glutamine tRNA ochre suppressor mutations, which have been attributed previously to mutation targeted at T = C pyrimidine dimers. In a lexA 51 recA 441 strain, where the SOS mutagenesis functions are constitutive, targeting at dimers is confirmed by demonstrating that the induction of glutamine <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> mutations is susceptible to photoreversal. In the same strain induction of backmutations is not susceptible to photoreversal. Thus delayed photoreversal mutagenesis produces suppressor mutations that can be targeted at pyrimidine dimers and does not produce backmutations that are not targeted at pyrimidine dimers. This correlation supports the idea that delayed photoreversal mutagenesis in umuC defective cells reflects a mutation process arrested at a targeting pyrimidine dimer photoproduct, which is the immediate cause of both the alteration in DNA sequence and the obstruction (unless repaired) to mutation fixation and ultimate expression...|$|E

Results and Discussion: We adapted eleven previously described frameshift <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> to the BioBrick cloning format, and built three genetic logic circuits to detect frameshift suppression. The three circuits employed three different mechanisms: direct frameshift suppression of reporter gene mutations, frameshift suppression leading to positive feedback via quorum sensing, and enzymatic amplification of frameshift suppression signals. In the course of testing frameshift suppressor logic, we uncovered unexpected behavior in the frameshift <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs.</b> The results led us to posit a four-base binding hypothesis for the frameshift <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> interactions with mRNA {{as an alternative to the}} published five-base binding model. Conclusion and Prospects: The published five-base anticodon/codon rule explained only 17 of the 58 frameshift suppression experiments we conducted. Our deduced four-base binding rule successfully explained 56 out of our 58 frameshift suppression results. In the process of applying biological knowledge about frameshift <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> to the engineering application of frameshift suppressor logic, we discovered new biological knowledge.

Two temperature- sensitive alleles, sec 2 - 41 and sec 2 - 59, encode proteins truncated by opal stop codons and are suppressible by an opal <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor.</b> Deletion analysis indicates that removal of the carboxyl terminal 251 amino acids has no apparent phenotype, while truncation of 368 amino acids causes temperature sensitivity.

All phenotypes of the temperature-sensitive sec 2 alleles are partially suppressed by duplication of the SEC 4 gene, but the lethality of a sec 2 disruption is not suppressed. The sec 2 - 41 mutation exhibits synthetic lethality with the same subset of the late acting sec mutants as does sec 4 - 8 and sec 15 - 1.

A pair of Schizosaccharomyces pombe nonsense suppressor tRNA genes were arranged in tandem such that expression of the downstream (supS 1) <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> was dependent upon transcription initiated by the internal promoter of the upstream (sup 9 -e) gene. Dominant mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated that suppress in trans the effect of an A block promoter mutation (A 19) in the sup 9 -e gene and restore supS 1 suppressor activity. Fifteen mutant strains, eight of which were independently isolated, all have elevated steady-state levels of sup 9 -e A 19 RNA consistent {{with an increase in}} gene transcription. Extracts of a strain carrying the dominant mutant gene, PCF 1, show a general 6 -fold stimulation in transcription of mutant (A 19) and wild-type tRNA genes and increase 5 S gene transcription 4 -fold compared with extracts from a wild-type strain. A transcription factor exclusion assay was used to show that the PCF 1 mutation affects two distinct stages in transcription: one prior to and one after stable complex formation; and that these effects are mediated by a component of the stable complex. Further evidence of an effect during complex assembly was obtained in a time-course experiment that showed a shortened lag phase in the PCF 1 extract.

Nonsense <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> (NSTs) were proposed as valuable tools for gene therapy of genetic diseases caused by premature termination codons (PTCs). Although various strategies were adapted {{over the years to}} increase NST expression and efficacy, low suppression efficacies of NSTs and toxicity associated with stable expression of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> have hampered development of NST mediated gene therapy. In this study, we have employed the U 6 promoter to enhance Gln-Amber <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> expression resulting in more effective suppression of PTCs. Since most tRNAs have cell specific differential expression, this technique will enable expression of different kinds of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> in various cell types at high, functionally relevant levels. In an attempt to study toxic effects of NSTs, stable cell lines that constitutively express U 6 promoter enhanced GlnUAG <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> were established. Proteomic analysis of these cells indicated that NST expression does not lead to significant read through of normal cellular proteins. The other major objective {{of this study was to}} design a viral vector for in vivo functional expression of <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs.</b> In that regard, first, we demonstrated that dsAAV 2 vectors can carry a GlnUAG tRNA (dsAAV 2 -U 6 GlnUAG) and be propagated at high titers. Second, the efficacy of suppression in vitro was demonstrated by the rescue of the expression of a GFP gene inactivated by an amber nonsense mutation in 293 cells by a dsAAV 2 -U 6 GlnUAG vector. Finally, our initial in vivo study here restored full length GFP in one SEGFP mouse and suggests that dsAAV 2 -U 6 GlnUAG vectors injected into SEGFP mouse may result in modest in vivo functional correction of a mutant GFP gene.

The Ka value between RF and UGA was 1. 26 × 106 M− 1 and that between the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> and UGA amounted to 8 × 103 M− 1. This result showed that RF had a 150 -fold stronger affinity than <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> for the opal termination codon. Incorporation of phosphoserine into phosphoprotein via phosphoseryl-tRNA was inhibited by addition of RF to the reaction mixture. These results suggest that animal natural <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> in the normal state does not perform its suppressor function, except in special cases where mRNA has the context structure near the opal termination codon (UGA) ...|$|R
40|$|In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{translation}} termination factors eRF 1 (Sup 45) and eRF 3 (Sup 35) are encoded by {{the essential}} genes SUP 45 and SUP 35 respectively. Heritable aggregation of Sup 35 results in {{formation of the}} yeast prion [PSI+]. It is known that combination of [PSI+] with some mutant alleles of the SUP 35 or SUP 45 genes in {{one and the same}} haploid yeast cell causes synthetic lethality. In this study, we perform detailed analysis of synthetic lethality between various sup 45 nonsense and missense mutations on one hand, and different variants of [PSI+] on the other hand. Synthetic lethality with sup 45 mutations was detected for [PSI+] variants of different stringencies. Moreover, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} in some combinations, synthetic lethality is dominant and occurs at the postzygotic stage after only a few cell divisions. The <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor</b> SUQ 5 counteracts the prion-dependent lethality of the nonsense alleles but not of the missense alleles of SUP 45, indicating that the lethal effect is due to the depletion of Sup 45. Synthetic lethality is also suppressed in the presence of the C-proximal fragment of Sup 35 (Sup 35 C) that lacks the prion domain and cannot be included into the prion aggregates. Remarkably, the production of Sup 35 C in a sup 45 mutant strain is also accompanied by an increase in the Sup 45 levels, suggesting that translationally active Sup 35 up-regulates Sup 45 or protects it from degradation...|$|E
40|$|The trp RNA-binding {{attenuation}} protein (TRAP) regulates {{expression of}} the Bacillus subtilis trpEDCFBA operon by transcription attenuation and translational control mechanisms. Both mechanisms require binding of tryptophan-activated TRAP to 11 (G/U) AG repeats in the trp leader transcript. trpE translational control involves formation of a TRAP-dependent RNA structure that sequesters the trpE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (the SD blocking hairpin). By comparing expression levels from trpE′-′lacZ translational fusions controlled by the wild-type leader or by a leader that cannot form the SD blocking hairpin, we found that translational control requires a tryptophan concentration higher than that required for transcription attenuation. We also found that inhibition of trpE translation by the SD blocking hairpin does not alter {{the stability of the}} downstream message. Since the coding sequences for trpE and trpD overlap by 29 nucleotides, we examined expression levels from trpED′-′lacZ translational fusions to determine if these two genes are translationally coupled. We found that introduction of a UAA stop codon in trpE resulted in a substantial reduction in expression. Since expression was partially restored {{in the presence of a}} <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor,</b> our results indicate that trpE and trpD are translationally coupled. We determined that the coupling mechanism is TRAP independent and that formation of the SD blocking hairpin regulates trpD translation via translational coupling. We also constructed a rho mutation to investigate the role of Rho-dependent termination in trp operon expression. We found that TRAP-dependent formation of the SD blocking hairpin allows Rho access to the nascent transcript, causing transcriptional polarity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. SEC 2 {{function}} is required at the post-Golgi apparatus {{stage of the}} yeast secretory pathway. The SEC 2 sequence encodes a protein product of 759 amino acids containing an amino terminal region that is predicted {{to be in an}} c~-helical, coiled-coil conformation. Two temperature-sensitive alleles, sec 2 - 41 and sec 2 - 59, encode proteins truncated by opal stop codons and are suppressible by an opal <b>tRNA</b> <b>suppressor.</b> Deletion analysis indicates that removal of the carboxy terminal 251 amino acids has no apparent phenotype, while truncation of 368 amino acids causes temperature sensitivity. The amino terminal half of the protein, containing the putative coiled-coil domain, is essential at all temperatures. Sec 2 protein is found predominantly in the soluble fraction and displays a native molecular mass of> 500 kD. All phenotypes of the temperature-sensitive sec 2 alleles are partially suppressed by duplication of the SEC 4 gene, but the lethality of a sec 2 disruption is not suppressed. The sec 2 - 41 mutation exhibits synthetic lethality with the same subset of the late acting sec mutants as does sec 4 - 8 and secl 5 - 1. The Sec 2 protein may function in conjunction with the Sec 4 and Secl 5 proteins to control vesicular traffic. T RANSPORT of material from one organelle to another in eukaryotic cells is generally mediated by vesicular traffic (Palade, 1975). The molecular events involved in the formation of vesicles from the donor compartment, their migration through the cytoplasm, and the recognition of and fusion with the target organelle are not yet understood. Both biochemical and genetic analysis have led to the identification of a number of components of the machiner...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} in order to elucidate the mechanisms of incorporation of Se into glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), in which selenocysteine corresponds to the opal termination codon UGA on the mRNA. We studied the above mechanisms using an opal <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA,</b> prepared from bovine liver, and casein as a model protein for the GSHPx apo-enzyme which might contain phosphoserine. The results showed that opal <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> did not accept selenocysteine (lower than 0. 1 mmol/mol) under the standard conditions. A trace amount of phosphoseryl-tRNA was converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA by incubation with H 2 Se and some enzymes. Meanwhile, a number of phosphoserine residues in casein were converted to selenocysteine residues by incubation with H 2 Se and enzymes. These results suggest that opal <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> {{plays a role in}} synthesizing GSHPx via co- and/or post-translational mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Two {{critical}} requirements for developing methods for the site-specific incorporation of amino acid analogues into proteins in vivo are (i) a <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> {{that is not}} aminoacylated {{by any of the}} endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and (ii) an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that aminoacylates the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> but no other tRNA in the cell. Here we describe two such aaRS–suppressor tRNA pairs, one for use in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and another for use in Escherichia coli. The “ 21 st synthetase–tRNA pairs” include E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) along with an amber suppressor derived from human initiator tRNA, for use in yeast, and mutants of the yeast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) along with an amber suppressor derived from E. coli initiator tRNA, for use in E. coli. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNAs</b> are aminoacylated in vivo only {{in the presence of the}} heterologous aaRSs, and the aminoacylated tRNAs function efficiently in suppression of amber codons. Plasmids carrying the E. coli GlnRS gene can be stably maintained in yeast. However, plasmids carrying the yeast TyrRS gene could not be stably maintained in E. coli. This lack of stability is most likely due to the fact that the wild-type yeast TyrRS misaminoacylates the E. coli proline tRNA. By using error-prone PCR, we have isolated and characterized three mutants of yeast TyrRS, which can be stably expressed in E. coli. These mutants still aminoacylate the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> essentially quantitatively in vivo but show increased discrimination in vitro for the <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> over the E. coli proline tRNA by factors of 2. 2 - to 6. 8 -fold...|$|R
40|$|We have cloned the Escherichia coli tyrosine-inserting amber <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> gene {{into the}} {{recombinant}} single-strand phage M 12 mp 3. By using the M 13 mp 3 SuIII+ recombinant phage DNA as template and an oligonucleotide bearing a mismatch as primer, we have synthesized in vitro an M 13 mp 3 SuIII heteroduplex DNA {{that has a}} single mismatch at a predetermined site in the tRNA gene. Transformation of E. coli with the heteroduplex DNA yielded M 13 recombinant phages carrying a mutant <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> gene in which the sequence G-T-T-C, corresponding to the universal G-T-pseudouracil-C sequence in E. coli tRNAs, is changed to G-A-T-C. The mutant DNA has been characterized by restriction mapping and by sequence analysis. In contrast to results with the wild-type <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> gene, cells transformed with recombinant plasmids carrying the mutant tRNA gene are phenotypically Su-. Thus, the single nucleotide change introduced has inactivated {{the function of the}} tRNA gene. By using E. coli minicells for studying the expression in vivo of cloned tRNA genes, we have found that cells transformed with recombinant plasmids carrying the mutant tRNA gene contain very little, if any, mature mutant <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> In contrast, the predominant low molecular weight RNA in cells transformed with recombinant plasmids carrying the wild-type <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA</b> gene is the mature tyrosine <b>suppressor</b> <b>tRNA.</b> Thus, while our results imply an important role for the G-T-pseudouracil-C sequence common to all E. coli tRNAs, whether this sequence is essential for tRNA biosynthesis, tRNA stability in vivo, or tRNA function remains to be determined. The procedures used to generate the mutant should be of general application toward site-specific mutagenesis on cloned DNAs, including regions that possess high degrees of secondary structure. In addition, the frequency of mutants among the progeny is high enough to enable one to identify and isolate site-specific mutants on any cloned DNA without requiring phenotypic selection...|$|R
