500|$|Following Roy Hodgson's {{appointment}} as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres {{would not be}} sold by the club, saying, [...] "He is not for sale and we don't welcome any offers for him. We want to keep him." [...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is looking forward to}} Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous." [...] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: [...] "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is {{the same as it was}} on my first day when I signed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrien Jones, the {{president}} of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, said, [...] "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmore <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there.... It was a family secret for 600 years and even Mr. Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{father got}} up, {{apparently}} recovering his serenity. [...] He {{was full of}} punch. [...] He washed, shaved and got dressed. [...] Then he strode out of his bedroom, flung {{open the door to}} the chancellery, and announced in a loud voice: [...] "From now on I'm giving everyone visas. [...] There will be no more nationalities, races or religions." [...] Then our father <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had heard a voice, that of his conscience or of God, which dictated to him what course of action he should take, and that everything was clear in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you knew}} my mother?" [...] she said. [...] "My father never <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> spoke of your {{being such a}} very old friend of his. Strange, {{to say the least}} of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Little didst thou {{think of}} our woe and grief when thy palfrey was found {{standing}} riderless at the stable door, and Sister Scholastica <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there <b>he</b> had been since nones! And she had none to send in quest but Cuddie, the neatherd.' ...|$|R
25|$|On March 28, on Nixon’s orders, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General Richard Kleindienst {{that nobody}} in the White House had prior {{knowledge}} of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder <b>told</b> <b>U.S.</b> attorneys <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had perjured himself during the burglars’ trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.|$|R
2500|$|Police {{said that}} he had been in {{psychiatric}} care, where he was treated for depression. Prosecutors {{said that he}} had been treated for two months in a mental care facility in 2015. De Maizière said that he may have been bullied by his peers, and police {{said that he had}} suffered [...] "bodily injury" [...] in an incident involving other young people in 2012. During the attack, Sonboly shouted that he had been bullied for seven years. A former classmate recalled, [...] "We always mobbed [...] him in school, and he always <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would kill us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the campaign in Poland the armoured forces were transferred to the west to prepare for the next set of operations. The four light divisions had proved to have inadequate firepower, and they were brought up to strength to full panzer divisions, one of which was given to Erwin Rommel. With this change the total number of panzer divisions in the Heer stood at ten. Guderian continued to work in development of the panzer arm. Said Hans von Luck of the 7th Panzer Division in his memoir: [...] "In the middle of February we were transferred to Dernau on the Ahr, hence practically in to the western front. Rommel visited every unit. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was proud to be permitted to lead a panzer division. Guderian too came to inspect and talk to us. 'You are the cavalry' he told us. 'Your job is to break through and keep going.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see {{his father}} alone; Bree thinks this is because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing. There, Rex reveals that Andrew {{wanted to see him}} alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home with them immediately, saying [...] "Our son just <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp. Now, I could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language." [...] Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him [...] "I would love you even if you were a murderer".|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} how she spoke of him and that Mr. Lovick didn't seem very nice about him? She <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> were to meet us--and she was so good as to intimate {{that it would be}} a pleasure to him to do so--he might give us, as she said, a tip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} see, Roberts. That would {{certainly}} be a last resource, and I fear {{that it would not}} be so effectual as you think. If <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> did not pay his usual visit to the boy it would be absolutely certain we should never see him alive again, we should not dare retain him." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{there was}} a delay in the nearer {{approach}} of the Injins, there was leisure to confer together for a moment. Mr. Warren <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen the [...] "disguised and armed" [...] pass the rectory, and had followed in order {{to act as a}} mediator between us and any contemplated harm.|$|R
2500|$|Axelrod is {{credited}} with implementing a strategy that encourages the participation of people, a lesson drawn partly from Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign {{as well as a}} personal goal of Barack Obama. Axelrod explained to Rolling Stone, [...] "When we started this race, Barack <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted the campaign to be a vehicle for involving people and giving them a stake in the kind of organizing he believed in. [...] According to Axelrod getting volunteers involved became the legacy of the campaign [...] " [...] This includes drawing on [...] "Web 2.0" [...] technology and viral media to support a grassroots strategy. Obama's web platform allows supporters to blog, create their own personal page, and even phonebank from home. Axelrod's elaborate use of the Internet helped Obama to organize under-30 voters and build over 475,000 donors in 2007, most of whom were Internet donors contributing less than $100 each. The Obama strategy stood in contrast to Hillary Clinton's campaign, which benefited from high name recognition, large donors and strong support among established Democratic leaders.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 February 2013, Chokri Belaid {{was leaving}} his house {{on his way}} to the {{headquarters}} of the Tunisian General Labour Union for a meeting with its secretary general when he was shot four times by a gunman who later took off on a motorbike driven by a second accomplice. Belaid was quickly rushed to the nearest clinic but the doctors couldn't save him and he was pronounced dead at the moment. Current secretary general of Belaid's party and leader of the Popular Front, Ziad Lakhdhar, said in a statement: [...] "Chokri Belaid was killed today by four bullets to the head and chest ... doctors <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has died. This is a sad day for Tunisia". It was also reported that Belaid had received several death threats prior to his assassination with many of his supporters blaming Ennahda for failing to protect him following those threats and an incident targeting fellow party members a week earlier. Belaid had always attacked the [...] "Leagues for the Protection of the Revolution" [...] (LPR), a government-aligned nationwide organization that claims to root out remnants of Ben Ali's regime but are accused of thuggish behaviour towards opposition groups, and he claimed that there are groups inside Ennahda that incite violence and that the LPR's committees are tools used by the government and its allied Islamists to get rid of the party's leftist coalition. The night before the incident, he appeared in a political talk show on Tunisia's Nessma TV and said; [...] "Rashid Ghannushi considers the leagues to be the conscience of the nation, so the defense of the authors of violence is clear. All those who oppose Ennahda become the targets of violence." [...] Following his assassination, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Interior Ministry building in Tunis carrying Belaid's coffin and shouted [...] "The people demand the fall of the regime". The day turned violent when some of the protesters threw rocks with the police using tear gas to disperse the rallies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you {{ask your}} God {{to clear it}} away?" [...] demanded Simek. [...] "Have you not <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> answers prayer offered {{in the name of}} Jesus?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward {{had come}} back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into {{what was to be}} done. First, Dr. Seward <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.|$|R
60|$|I {{never knew}} {{scientists}} could rise to such occasions. Old Mangum orally labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily {{among the lowest}} orders of the vertebrates; and in English, too, without going any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix, Rex Helvetii--which {{is as far as}} I ever went, myself. And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection.|$|R
6000|$|... 870. Hesiod flourishes. <b>He</b> hath <b>told</b> <b>us</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{lived in}} the age next after the wars of Thebes and Troy, and that this age should end when the men then living grew hoary and dropt into the grave; and {{therefore}} it was but of an ordinary length: and Herodotus has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Hesiod and Homer were but 400 years older than himself. Whence {{it follows that the}} destruction of Troy was not older than we have represented it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{wondered}} {{what had become}} of you," [...] Doast said, [...] "and should not have found you, if Rajbullub had not <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw you come out here.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is in {{attendance}} on the duke, my lord," [...] Beorn said. [...] "We presented ourselves also at his tent, but he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> required no duty from us." ...|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, Morrison <b>told</b> <b>US</b> Weekly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped no Spears songs {{would be}} {{performed}} on Glee. Based on his comments, Murphy had Morrison's character Will spend the episode resisting his students' desire to perform her songs. Will's storyline featuring a Chevrolet Corvette involved product placement for the Chevrolet division of General Motors, who became an advertiser and event sponsor for Glee {{prior to its}} 2009 launch.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{went to the}} men in the village, {{and spoke}} at length to them: [...] "Yes, God will not cast out those who turn to Him when they are called, but you must not suppose <b>that</b> it is <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{anywhere}} <b>that</b> <b>He</b> will save those who care nothing about Him through their years of health, and only think about Him and the world to come when this world is already passing away." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea of his taking himself well to task, {{with that}} {{laughing}} face and heedless manner {{and with a}} fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold, was ludicrously anomalous. However, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> between-whiles <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was doing it {{to such an extent}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wondered his hair didn't turn grey. His regular wind-up of the business was (as I have said) <b>that</b> <b>he</b> went to Mr. Kenge's about midsummer to try how he liked it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He will be {{out there}} himself, father. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had for some little time been {{thinking}} of returning to Flanders, and that now he should do so at once. How was it, father, that the men-at-arms did not defend the Tower?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{suggesting}} that we may meet Mr. Lessingham?" [...] Helen enquired, lazily. [...] "I am perfectly certain that he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy. As to Zeppelins, don't you remember he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hated them and was terrified of bombs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That evening {{there came}} {{what seemed to}} me to be a grand release, for Hudson <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to leave us. He walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and {{announced}} his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.|$|E
60|$|One morning Mr. Malcolm MacPherson <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was coming}} up that evening to make Aunt Olivia set the day. Peggy and I laughingly approved, telling {{him that it was}} high time for him to assert his authority, and he went off in great good humour across the river field, {{whistling}} a Highland strathspey. But Aunt Olivia looked like a martyr. She had a fierce attack of housecleaning that day, and put everything in flawless order, even to the corners.|$|R
60|$|We {{made him}} fully {{sensible}} {{that we knew}} how obliging that compliment was, but begged he would admit any whom he thought worthy to be trusted with a secret of the last importance. He then carried it as far the other way, and <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> then <b>he</b> must call in the whole ship's company, for {{that there was not}} a man in the ship but he could trust his life in his hands. However, upon the whole, he sent everybody out of the cabin but us three and himself, and then desired we would speak our minds freely.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is true that}} we have {{an excuse}} put before us with much suavity of {{language}} in these debates--we are told that the House of Lords seeks to interpret {{the will of the people}}, and it is explained that by [...] "the will of the people," [...] what is meant is the persistent, sub-conscious will, as opposed to any articulate expression of it. The right hon. gentleman who leads the Opposition <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> what <b>he</b> meant by the persistent will was the will of the people expressed continuously over a period of thirty years. <b>That</b> is what <b>he</b> called [...] "democracy properly understood." ...|$|R

60|$|He now <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{orders to}} take us before the consul. Nothing loth, we formed in procession; and, {{with the old man}} at our head, sighing and labouring like an engine, and flanked by a guard of some twenty natives, we started for the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{young men}} are beyond hearing," [...] {{returned}} the chief. [...] "I have sent them away. My breast {{is open to the}} knife in the hand of Bounding Bull.

60|$|We {{have enough}} to live on in comfort at home--no more. Papa has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not (and can never hope to be) a rich man. This is not the worst of it. Last year, he refused to marry a young couple, both {{belonging}} to our congregation. This was very unlike his usual kind self. Helena and I asked him for his reasons. They were reasons that did not take long to give. The young gentleman's father was a rich man. He had forbidden his son to marry a sweet girl--because she had no fortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure as I {{was that}} you won't. I didn't think I could ever have eaten horse-flesh, but it is really not so bad. Monsieur Michaud <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> yesterday, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dined out with some friends and had had both cat and rat. Of course they were {{disguised}} with sauces, but the people {{made no secret of}} what they were, and he said they were really very nice. I don't think I could try them, but I don't feel as certain as I did; anyhow, we haven't begun to touch our stores, and there is no talk of confiscating everything yet." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the next}} conference we acquainted {{him with the}} adventures of the Golden River, and how we had shared what we got there, so that every man had a larger stock than he for his share; that, therefore, instead of taking any from him, we had {{resolved}} every one {{to add a little}} to him. He appeared very glad that we had met with such good success, but would not take a grain from us, till at last, pressing him very hard, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> then <b>he</b> would take it thus:--that, when we came to get any more, he would have so much out of the first as should make him even, and then we would go on as equal adventurers; and thus we agreed.|$|R
