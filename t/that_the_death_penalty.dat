25|$|Coker v. Georgia, , held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{for rape}} {{of an adult}} woman was grossly disproportionate and {{excessive}} punishment, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A few states continued to have child rape statutes that authorized the death penalty. In Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), the court expanded Coker, ruling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> is unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.|$|E

25|$|The Court's {{approach}} to the death penalty, itself permitted by {{the text of the}} original Convention, may reduce its use by non-signatory States that seek to extradite suspects from signatory States.
