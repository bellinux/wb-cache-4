5|$|The ascent is {{made at the}} {{recommended}} rate until the diver reaches the depth of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stop.</b> The diver then maintains the specified stop depth for the specified period, before ascending to the next stop depth at {{the recommended}} rate, and follows the same procedure again. This is repeated until all required decompression has been completed and the diver reaches the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{controlling}} compartment for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> {{is usually}} the fastest tissue, but this generally changes during the ascent, and slower tissues usually control the shallower stop times. The longer the bottom time and closer to saturation of the slower tissues, the slower the tissue controlling the final stops will be.|$|E
5|$|The {{depth of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> is found from the tissue {{compartment}} {{with the highest}} partial pressure, {{and the depth of}} first decompression stop is the standard stop depth where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>first</b> deep safety <b>stop</b> and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> [...] "required" [...] stop is greater than 30 feet (9 m), then a second deep safety stop is added halfway between <b>the</b> <b>first</b> deep safety <b>stop</b> and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> required <b>stop.</b>|$|R

50|$|The leaders began pitting {{for their}} <b>first</b> <b>stops</b> on lap 15, with Vettel <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to <b>stop,</b> {{followed}} by Button two laps later and Webber and Rosberg on lap 18. Significantly, Vettel was fuelled lighter on a three-stop strategy, {{in contrast to}} the other leaders two-stop strategy. Vettel was therefore able to close the gap on Button after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stops</b> with his lighter car, but was unable to make the pass he needed before his second stop on lap 29. Vettel exited the pits behind Webber, with all the leaders due to make one more pit stop.|$|R

[...] The K-car Commander, using the radio callsign One-Nine, Two-Nine, Three-Nine, or Four-Nine, {{depending}} on the Commando, had to first attempt to confirm the precise area where the enemy had been spotted by the Observation Post. [...] Usually the terrain was extremely broken and covered in vegetation, which made this task particularly difficult. [...] The K-car Commander then had to devise a plan of attack including initial placement of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stops</b> and where and in what direction to make the main sweep. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>stops</b> to arrive were ferried in by the G-cars, which followed the K-car in a column (sometimes a long way behind, for they were a little slower than the K-car).|$|R

5|$|From 1 to 31 May 1924, the Royal Air Force {{conducted}} {{a number of}} night flying experiments. Pilots were asked to keep an extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place. On 27 and 28 September, the elimination trials for the Light Aircraft Trials were held. Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper. Also in October, it was notified that changes were being made expanding weather information given at Lympne. Amongst the changes were that measurements used were to be changed from imperial to metric. The addition of weather information at Haren, Brussels and Ostend, both in Belgium was notified. In 1924, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross-channel services for Imperial Airways. Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> in France was St Inglevert. When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the Coastguard was informed.
