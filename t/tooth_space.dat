40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors. The simulation examined varying amplitudes of spacing error and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs. The modification considered included both linear and parabolic tip relief. The analysis considered spacing error that varies around most of the gear circumference (similar to a typical sinusoidal error pattern) as well as a shorter span of spacing errors that occurs on only a few teeth. The dynamic analysis was performed using a revised version of a NASA gear dynamics code, modified to add <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors to the analysis. Results obtained from the investigation show that linear tip relief is more effective in reducing dynamic loads on gears with small spacing errors but parabolic tip relief becomes more effective as the amplitude of spacing error increases. In addition, the parabolic modification is more effective for the more severe error case where the error is spread over a longer span of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design robust tooth profile modification for improving dynamic performance of gear sets with different <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors...|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} ratio of an iCVT {{has to be}} changed one increment within less than one full rotation of its variator pulley. This means that the transmission diameter of the variator pulley, made generally from rubber, has to be changed from a diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth to another diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth; such as changing the transmission diameter of the variator pulley from a diameter that has a circumferential length of 7 teeth to a diameter that has a circumferential length of 8 teeth for example. This is because if the transmission diameter of the variator pulley {{does not have a}} circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth, such as a circumferential length of 7½ teeth for example, improper engagement between the teeth of the variator pulley and its chain will occur. For example, imagine having a bicycle pulley with 7½ teeth; here improper engagement between the bicycle pulley and its chain will occur when the tooth behind the ½ <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> is about to engage with its chain, since it is positioned a distance of ½ tooth too late relative to its chain.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis has been developed to predict and measure the cutting forces in the gear hobbing process. A review of past {{research in this area}} has highlighted the need to adopt a different approach to modelling the process in order to predict the cutting forces. The hobbing process has been described using six different co-ordinate systems and the kinematic relationships between these systems established. A single rack profile has been used to represent the profile of a single cutting tooth from the hob which was then extended to simulate the hob itself. When the hob gashes pass through the cutting region surfaces are generated which, if mapped on a regular grid can give the basis to estimate the depth of cut, i. e. the instantaneous chip thickness produced by that particular tooth. The instantaneous cutting forces generated by that tooth then can be estimated by using the concept of a specific cutting force of the workpiece material. The estimation of cutting forces acting on a single <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> was used to predict the cutting forces produced during machining of a full gear, by assuming that the forces acting in a particular <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> are equal to those acting on the adjacent <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> at an equivalent instant in the cutting cycle. In order to validate predicted results, a Churchill PH 1612 hobbing machine was retrofitted with a CNC control system at Newcastle University, utilising a programmable multi axis controller (PMAC). A specially made single toothed gear, and a full gear were machined, and cut on this machine, and the cutting forces measured in real time using a 3 -axis dynamometer. The force signals produced by the dynamometer were measured utilising a 12 -bit ADC card. Code, written in C, was developed to perform the many functions needed for the overall control of the machine, but additionally was used to capture both the cutting forces and axis position data. The results of the simulation and modelling have shown very good agreement with those obtained experimentally. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|External {{gear pump}} is an {{important}} category of positive displacement fluid machines used to perform the mechanical–hydraulic energy conversions in many fluid power applications. An efficient numerical simulation program {{is needed to simulate}} the system in order to provide a direction for design purpose. The model consists of a lumped parameter fluid dynamic model and a model that simulates the radial micro-motions of the gear’s axes of rotation. The system consists of a set of ordinary differential equations related to the conservation on mass of the internal control volumes of the pump, which are given by the <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> volumes of the gears. Flow connections between the control volumes are introduced, as laminar or turbulent orifices to model the displacing action and the internal leakages of the unit. In order to optimize the numerical solution, the whole system is described in C++ and the ODEs are solved using linear multistep methods. The results of the simulation successfully match the experimental results as well as the predictions of a previously developed simulation tool. The results detail several features of the model, such as its capability of predicting the instantaneous <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> volume pressure, the micro-motion of the gears and the outlet flow oscillations. The simulation model can be utilized in future research on external gear pump, as well as for design purposes. In particular, with its simulation swiftness the model is particularly suitable for virtual prototyping within numerical optimization procedures...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{investigation}} for the identification, measurement and modelling of the gear pump performance under marginal suction condition, {{created in the}} suction line and resulting in cavitation at the suction port and cavitation erosion on the delivery side plate is introduced. A new technique {{for the detection of}} cavitation in gear pumps has been employed and proved to be more efficient and less expensive than other techniques available. The experimental study has been carried out by monitoring the pressure ripple at the pump inlet and outlet, as well as investigating the pressure distribution around the gear rotor under cavitating and non-cavitating conditions. It was found that the gear pump cavitation appeared in three distinct stages, these being cavitation-inception, discrete-cavitation and continuous-cavitation. These stages of cavit tion were investigated by means of pressure distribution around the gear rotor using a miniature pressure transducer positioned at a gear fillet. The experimental results demonstrate a drop in filling efficiency, of the <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> due to cavitation, which provides a further understanding of the pump performance characteristics at different inlet conditions.

40|$|The hobbing {{theory of}} {{generating}} the {{involute gear teeth}} has been often reported. However, a hobbing mechanism of enlarging the unfinished <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> has been rarely investigated, because this mechanism is very complicated and the cutting behaviors are different with each tooth {{and even in the}} position on one tooth profile. In order to make clear the causes of the tooth wear and the hobbing vibration, it is necessary to know the cutting behaviors at any point on the edge. This paper describes a method of calculating the length and the thickness to be cut on each point closely divided along the tooth profile without neglecting the tip roundness. This method can be applied to any hobbing condition, e. g. to the cases of spur or helical gear, and the conventional or the climb hobbing. Some examples analyzed by this method are compared with the practical hobbing results, and then some suggestions for both wear and vibration analyses are given...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{transient}} phenomenon of chip generations and {{behavior in the}} gear hobbing process are investigated by using a high-speed video camera. The chip behavior generated in gear finish hobbing process is very complicated and one can not identify each chip from specified cutting edges. The authors have built up a new simulation method of the hobbing process using a flying tool and a special-shaped workpiece, which consists of one <b>tooth</b> <b>space.</b> Visual evidences of the chip interference on the rake face and some conditions of contact between generated chips and the work surface were visually obtained. In the case of dry cutting conditon with a high-speed steel (HSS) flytool without coating on the rake face, the flytool cuts the workpiece frequently with the stuck chip generated in the previous revolution on the rake face. The newly generated chip pushes out the previous stuck chip, which flies away eventually. The chip flow on the rake face interferes strongly {{at the corner of}} the cutting edge when both top and side cutting edges produce different chips at the same time, and the chips flow out in changing the shape. The moving speed of the chip was also measured...|$|E
