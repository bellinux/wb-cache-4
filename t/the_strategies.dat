40|$|Although a strategy, in theory, {{should help}} the {{organization}} {{to move in the}} same direction by showing a direction for the organization, in practice <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> increases <b>the</b> number of possible paths, as managers translate <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> into their own context. This increases <b>the</b> number of <b>strategies</b> in <b>the</b> organization, and it becomes difficult to get an overview of the interaction and relationships between <b>the</b> translated <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> managers distinguish between the different parts of <b>the</b> <b>strategy,</b> such as <b>the</b> abstract words or intention, and the concrete as targets and projects. Managers use the various parts of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> in different contexts, but still speak about "strategy" even if they have changed dimension like the words and KPIs. Another dimension is that the managers also perceive <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> as correct, but irrelevant, which is linked to their distinction between the abstract and the concrete in <b>the</b> <b>strategy.</b> <b>The</b> abstract dimension is perceived as being true, while the effet of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> may be irrelevant for certain managers. <b>The</b> <b>strategy</b> is also used as documentation for senior management intentions.
