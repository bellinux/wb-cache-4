He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E
