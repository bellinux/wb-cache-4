5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, {{to which the}} marquis belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the <b>test.</b> <b>As</b> William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E

5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection <b>test.</b> <b>As</b> the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the mayor}} of Richmond granted the pair {{the freedom of the}} city. The {{scoreboard}} at Punt Road Oval, Richmond's home ground was named the Ring-Johnston scoreboard in honour of their feat. Johnston took match figures of 3/55 in the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>as</b> Australia completed the series with a win. Johnston ended the season by taking a total of 7/86 in Victoria's innings win over South Australia. He ended the entire first-class season with 54 wickets at 20.63.|$|E
5|$|Craig {{failed to}} pass 20 in the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>as</b> Australia won again to take a creditable 3–0 series win, {{something}} highly unexpected {{at the beginning of}} the tour. Overall, Craig's men won 11 of their 20first-class games on tour, and the South African Cricket Annual recognised the Australian captain's leadership by naming him as one of their Five Cricketers of the Year.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding <b>test</b> <b>as</b> well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would want to go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the match}} {{immediately}} after the First Test, Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire, putting on 122 runs with Lindsay Hassett as Australian completed an innings win.

5|$|The board noted that: {{the test}} {{planners}} {{had failed to}} identify the <b>test</b> <b>as</b> hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, sliding doors, and sharp turns.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear <b>test</b> <b>as</b> conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus <b>test,</b> <b>as</b> a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, they are relayed command orders and objectives dispatched by the Selene military satellite, Hyperion. The orders are synthesized by the on-board central computer EOS, which also records and relays the player's flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After {{completion of the}} last objective, the player is informed by Hyperion that the battle pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter has been completed {{according to the data}} from their battle record. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS <b>test</b> <b>as</b> reward for their heroic efforts and that upon the player's death, they shall advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration. After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the EOS test, the pilot wonders why they must be terminated by their ally and questions their military leaders' rationale for the war.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{once more}} batted {{first in the}} third Test, scoring 489. For {{tactical}} reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe. Wet weather altered {{the course of the}} match and, despite an opening partnership of 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Australia won by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth <b>Test</b> <b>as</b> England won by an innings, but Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and in a heavy defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, he scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66, and made two half-centuries in addition to his three hundreds. Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world. Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and Wisden judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series. In all games, Hobbs scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} Test, Miller played for Victoria against England {{in his final}} match for his native state before moving to New South Wales. He scored six before being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First <b>Test,</b> <b>as</b> England scored 355 before Victoria replied with 327. His victims {{included}} Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs without taking a wicket.|$|E

5|$|Chappell became South Australian captain {{when the}} long-serving Les Favell retired {{at the start}} of the 1970–1971 season. His younger brother Greg made his debut in the second Test of the summer against Ray Illingworth's England. Facing an English attack led by the hostile fast bowling of John Snow, Chappell scored a half-century in each of the first two Tests, but failed to {{capitalise}} on good starts while Greg Chappell scored 108 in his initial innings. Rain caused the abandonment of the third Test without a ball being bowled. Temporarily promoted to open the batting, Chappell failed in the fourth <b>Test</b> <b>as</b> Australia lost. In the fifth Test at Melbourne, he returned to number three and started nervously. Dropped on 0 and 14, Chappell found form and went on to post his maiden Ashes century (111 from 212 balls), which he followed with scores of 28 and 104 in the sixth Test.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Test, Hamence made 21 at No. 6 as Australia amassed 456 and {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Hamence {{was yet to}} bat when rain ended the match at 3/215 in Australia's first innings. He was rested as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hamence was recalled as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. He made 14 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in the second when Australia declared, having batted at No. 5 both times. In the last match before the Fifth Test, a non-first-class fixture against Durham, Hamence scored 24 batting at No. 6 in Australia's 282. The match was a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Hamence was overlooked for the Fifth <b>Test,</b> <b>as</b> Australia won by an innings to seal the series 40; the drawn Third Test was Australia's only non-victory.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the <b>test</b> <b>as</b> hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
