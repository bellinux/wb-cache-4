5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attract mates, while others use <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, take <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the stations, ship <b>them</b> <b>to</b> London and deliver <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the designated firms, {{in return for a}} flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills in order for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this.

It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E

People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely <b>to</b> happen <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely <b>to</b> happen <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.|$|R
