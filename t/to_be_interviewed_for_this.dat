"Many of {{the public}} health {{officials}} who discount the thimerosal theory were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> book (or prohibited from speaking by superiors)," [...] Kirby later wrote. [...] "Readers are invited to reach their own conclusions on the evidence." [...] Nevertheless, Kirby also acknowledges [...] "(E)ach side accuses the other of being irrational, overzealous, blind to evidence they find inconvenient, and subject to professional, financial, or emotional conflicts of interest that cloud their judgment." [...] Ultimately, Kirby finds the evidence leveled against thimerosal inconclusive but suggestive, and calls urgently for further research.|$|E
