However, {{it has not been}} feasible to gain insight into the reasons why a certain prediction is made. Due to this limitation, the use of machine learning techniques in the capital market has met a critical hurdle. This chapter outlines a method based on pedagogical learning <b>for</b> extracting <b>rules</b> from support vector machines. To the best of our knowledge, the experiments reported here are the first attempt to utilize learning based rule extraction from support vector <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> financial data mining. The experiments use predictions from support vector <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> extracting <b>rules</b> associated with the first-day returns of "initial public offerings" (IPOs) in the US stock market. A novel feature of the experiments is the simultaneous application of fundamental and technical analysis in the context of predicting the success of IPOs.

30|$|As {{pointed out}} in “Unordered <b>machine</b> {{learning}} <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> OBC” section, {{it is necessary to}} obtain rules by learning, in order to improve performances of OBC system, with the additional advantage to enrich the descriptions of concepts in ontology for robust classification when some features are missing. Describing RSO with different feature sets makes the classification more flexible, and not dependent on only one feature set. Classification rules learned from features RSO data are just about descriptions of RSO with feature sets. When learned classification rules are integrated into OntoStar, the completeness of OntoStar increases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper extends a {{previous}} market microstruc-ture model, where we used Genetic Programming (GP) as an inference engine <b>for</b> trading <b>rules,</b> and Self Organizing Maps as a clustering <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> those <b>rules.</b> Experiments in that work took place {{under a single}} financial market and investigated whether its behavior is non-stationary or cyclic. Results showed that the market’s behavior was constantly changing and strategies that would not adapt to these changes, would become obsolete, and their performance would thus decrease over time. However, because experiments in that work {{were based on a}} specific GP algorithm, we are interested in this paper to prove that those results are independent of the choice of such algorithms. We thus repeat our previous tests under two more GP frameworks. In addition, while our previous work surveyed only a single market, in this paper we run tests under 10 markets, for generalization purposes. Finally, we deepen our analysis and investigate whether the performance of strategies, which have not co-evolved with the market, follows a continuous decrease, as it has been previously suggested in the agent-based artificial stock market literature. Results show that our previous results are not sensitive to the choice of GP. Strategies that do not co-evolve with the market, become ineffective. However, we do not find evidence for a continuous performance decrease of these strategies. I...|$|R

To solve the problem, this article develops a special software to plan cutting path <b>for</b> <b>ruled</b> surface impellers. An approximation algorithm to generate cutting path <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> integral <b>ruled</b> surface impellers is proposed. By fitting sampling data points of an impeller blade into a curve, {{a model of}} ruled surface blade of an impeller is built up. Furthermore, by calculating the points where the cutter axis vector intersects the free-form hub surface of an impeller, problems about, for instance, the ambiguity in calculation and machining the wide blade surface with a short flute cutter are solved. Finally, an integral impeller cutting path is planned by way of an integrated cutter location control algorithm. Simulation and machining tests with an impeller are performed on a 5 -axis computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill machine, which shows the feasibility of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This paper extends a {{previous}} model where {{we examined the}} markets' microstructure dynamics by using Genetic Programming as a trading rule inference engine, and Self Organizing Maps as a cluster- ing <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> those <b>rules.</b> However, an assumption we made in that model was that clusters, and thus trading strategy types, had to remain the same over time. This assumption could be considered unrealistic, but {{it was necessary for}} the purposes of our tests. For this reason, in this paper we extend this model by relaxing this assumption. Hence our framework does not lie on pre-speci?ed types, nor do these types remain the same throughout time. This allows us to investigate the dynamics of market behavior and more speci?cally whether successful strategies from the past can be successfully applied to the future. In the past, we investigated this phenomenon by using a simple ?tness test. Neverthe- less, a drawback of that approach was that because of its simplicity, it could only o?er limited understanding of the complex dynamics of mar- ket behavior. With the extended model we can thus have a more realistic view of the markets and hence draw safer conclusions about their behav- ior. Empirical results show that market behavior is non-stationary, and thus agents' strategies need to continuously co-evolve with the market, in order to remain eff?ective...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{some new}} voting rules {{based on a}} spatial version of the median in Rk known as the mediancentre, or Fermat-Weber point. Voting rules based on the mean include many that are familiar: the Borda Count, Kemeny rule, approval voting, etc. (see [35], [36]). These mean rules can be implemented by “voting machines” (interactive simulations of physical mechanisms) that use ideal rubber bands to achieve an equilibrium among the competing preferences of the voters. One consequence is that in any such rule, a voter who is further from consensus exerts a stronger tug on the election outcome, because her rubber band is more stretched. While the R 1 median has been studied {{in the context of}} voting, mediancentre-based rules are new. Voting <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> these <b>rules</b> require that the tug exerted by a voter be independent of his distance from consensus; replacing rubber bands with weights suspended from strings provides exactly this effect. We discuss some novel properties exhibited by these rules, as well as a broader question suggested by our investigations — What are the critical relationships among resistance to manipulation, decisiveness, and responsiveness <b>for</b> a voting <b>rule?</b> We argue that a distorted view may arise from an exclusive focus on the first, without due attention to the other two. 1 Rubber band voting machines We’ll consider voting <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> which A is a finite set of alternatives, and a ballot consists of a strict ranking (linear ordering) of A’s members.

Besides printing equipment, AUP also inherited 3 <b>type-casting</b> <b>machines</b> and a vast collection of type; over 600 tons worth, including Russian, German, Bengali, Greek, and Hebrew. Rather than purchasing typesets as many other printers did, John Thomson had preferred the firm to maintain its own type foundry. This arrangement was beneficial for the company, as Thomson explained {{in an article in}} the British Printer in 1904: [...] "We can cast nearly all the type we want, and at much less than the typefounders can sell it to us. Why, we gain close on 50% on the type account." [...] World War I critically impacted this arrangement. With wartime scarcity, the price of metals increased to the point that AUP could not afford the required lead and antimony. The resultant drop in quality of AUP's type metal and increase in printing prices began to impact their customer base, as in 1917 when John Long Ltd. informed the AUP board that they could no longer place printing orders with the company.|$|R
40|$|LP) 2 is an {{algorithm}} for adaptive Information Extraction from Web-related {{text that}} induces symbolic rules by learning from a corpus tagged with SGML tags. Induction is performed by bottom-up generalisation of examples in a training corpus. Training is performed in two steps: initially {{a set of}} tagging rules is learned; then additional rules are induced to correct mistakes and imprecision in tagging. Shallow NLP is used to generalise rules beyond the flat word structure. Generalization allows a better coverage on unseen texts, as it limits data sparseness and overfitting in the training phase. In experiments on publicly available corpora the algorithm outperforms any other algorithm presented in literature and tested on the same corpora. Experiments also show a significant gain in using NLP in terms of (1) effectiveness (2) reduction of training time and (3) training corpus size. In this paper we present the <b>machine</b> learning algorithm <b>for</b> <b>rule</b> induction.

In this paper, {{we are interested in}} evolutionary algorithms, the so-called genetics-based machine learning algorithms. In particular, we will focus on evolutionary approaches that evolve a set of rules, i. e., evolutionary rule-based systems, applied to classification tasks, in order to provide a state of the art in this field. This paper has a double aim: to present a taxonomy of the genetics-based <b>machine</b> learning approaches <b>for</b> <b>rule</b> induction, and to develop an empirical analysis both for standard classification and for classification with imbalanced data sets.

40|$|This paper formalizes {{observations}} {{made under}} agent-based artificial stock market models into a concrete hypothesis, {{which is called}} the Dinosaur Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the behavior of financial markets constantly changes and that the trading strategies in a market need to continuously co-evolve with {{it in order to}} remain effective. After formalizing the hypothesis, we suggest a testing methodology and run tests under 10 international financial markets. Our tests are based on a framework that we recently developed, which used Genetic Programming as a rule inference engine, and Self-Organizing Maps as a clustering <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> the above <b>rules.</b> However, an important assumption of that study was that maps among different periods were directly comparable with each other. In order to allow this to happen, we had to keep the same clusters throughout the different time periods of our experiments. Nevertheless, this assumption could be considered as strict or even unrealistic. In this paper, we relax this assumption. This makes our model more realistic. In addition, this allows us to investigate in depth the dynamics of market behavior and test for the plausibility of the Dinosaur Hypothesis. The results show that indeed markets' behavior constantly changes. As a consequence, strategies need to continuously co-evolve with the market; if they do not, they become obsolete or dinosaurs.
