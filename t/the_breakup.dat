5|$|Through 1935, as <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation {{through the}} courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist.

After the House of Representatives defeated <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> to take place within three years.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the first-order and higher-order {{interferences}} on {{the total}} (Coulomb+nuclear), Coulomb and nuclear breakup cross sections in the 15 C+ 208 Pb, 11 Be+ 208 Pb breakup reactions are first studied at 68 MeV/u incident energy. It is shown that the first-order interference reduces by more than 60 % <b>the</b> total <b>breakup</b> cross sections, by less than 3 % <b>the</b> Coulomb <b>breakup</b> cross sections and by more than 85 % <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> cross sections, for both reactions. On the other hand, the high-order interference is found to reduce by less than 9 % <b>the</b> total <b>breakup</b> cross section, less than 1 % <b>the</b> Coulomb <b>breakup</b> cross section and less than 7 % <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> cross section for the 15 C+ 208 Pb reaction. For the 11 Be+ 208 Pb reaction however, the high-order interference reduces by less than 7 % <b>the</b> total <b>breakup</b> cross section, by less than 1 % <b>the</b> Coulomb <b>breakup</b> cross section and by less than 4 % <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> cross section. It is finally shown that even at first-order, the incoherent sum of <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> cross sections {{is more important than}} the incoherent sum of <b>the</b> Coulomb <b>breakup</b> cross sections for the two reactions. The role of the diagonal and off-diagonal continuum-continuum couplings on total, Coulomb and nuclear breakup cross sections is also investigated for the 8 B+ 58 Ni, 8 B+ 208 Pb and 19 C+ 208 Pb at 29. 3, 170. 3 MeV and 1273 MeV incident energies respectively. Qualitatively, we found that, the diagonal continuum-continuum couplings are responsible for the large reduction of the differential total and nuclear breakup cross sections at backward angles. At forward angles, this reduction is due to the off-diagonal continuum-continuum couplings. In the absence of these couplings, <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> is <b>the</b> more dominant process, while when they are included, <b>the</b> Coulomb <b>breakup</b> becomes dominant. This shows that, <b>the</b> nuclear <b>breakup</b> is more affected by the continuum-continuum couplings than its Coulomb counterpart. Quantitatively, we found that, the off-diagonal countinuum-countinuum couplings reduce by 13. 39 %, 12. 71 % and 11. 11 % <b>the</b> total <b>breakup</b> cross sections for the 8 B+ 58 Ni, 8 B+ 208 Pb and 19 C+ 208 Pb reactions, respectively.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{inclusive}} <b>breakup</b> of three-fragment projectiles {{is discussed}} within a four-body spectator model. Both <b>the</b> elastic <b>breakup</b> and <b>the</b> non-elastic <b>breakup</b> are obtained in a unified framework. Originally {{developed in the}} 80 's for two-fragment projectiles such as the deuteron, in this paper the theory is successfully generalized to three-fragment projectiles. The expression obtained for the inclusive cross section allows the extraction of the incomplete fusion cross section, and accordingly generalizes the surrogate method to cases such as (t, p) and (t, n) reactions. It is found that two-fragment correlations inside the projectile affect in a conspicuous way <b>the</b> elastic <b>breakup</b> cross section. <b>The</b> inclusive non-elastic <b>breakup</b> cross section is calculated and is found to contain the contribution of a three-body absorption term that is also strongly influenced by the two-fragment correlations. This latter cross section contains the so-called incomplete fusion where more than one compound nuclei are formed.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>breakup</b> of inelastic non-Newtonian liquid drops {{was investigated}} experimentally using high-speed photography, and then simulated using an extended version of <b>the</b> Taylor analogy <b>breakup</b> (TAB) model. ^ Videos {{were used to}} determine breakup morphology and <b>breakup</b> times. <b>The</b> effects of material properties consistency (K) and flow behavior (n) indices on these quantities were also determined. ^ Key findings are: (1) Non-Newtonian drop secondary breakup modes are qualitatively similar to those observed for Newtonian drops. The only major difference is that the bag stretches more before it ruptures and <b>the</b> resulting <b>breakup</b> fragments persist for a much longer time than their Newtonian counterparts. (2) Weber (We) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers are appropriate dimensionless groups for characterizing non-Newtonian drop breakup mode boundaries. Values that demark the bag boundaries are close to the corresponding Newtonian ones, while those for multimode breakup are significantly higher then their Newtonian counterparts. (3) Three bag breakup times were defined: initial, Tini, bag breakup time (Tbag), and rim breakup time (Trim). Tini was found to increase with K, but to be independent of n. Tbag and Trim were observed to be directly proportional to both indices. (4) Four multimode breakup times are reported: <b>the</b> first bag <b>breakup</b> time (Tbag 1), <b>the</b> second bag <b>breakup</b> time (Tbag 2), <b>the</b> rim <b>breakup</b> time (Trim) and <b>the</b> stamen <b>breakup</b> time (Tstamen).
