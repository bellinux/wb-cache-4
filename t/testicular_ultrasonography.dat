Ultrasound examinations were performed in longitudinal and transversal planes of the testicles of 111 healthy Nelore bovines, at the ages of nine, 13 and 15 months. The EIV software calculated the echogenicity of the testicular parenchyma, which ranged from 0 (anechoic) to 100 % (hyperechoic).

40|$|AbstractBull {{breeding}} soundness evaluation (BBSE) {{is commonly}} undertaken to identify bulls that are potentially unfit {{for use as}} breeding sires. Various studies worldwide have found that approximately 20 % of the bulls fail their routine prebreeding BBSE and are therefore considered subfertile. Multiple articles describe the use of testicular ultrasound as a noninvasive aid {{in the identification of}} specific testicular and epididymal lesions. Two previous studies have hypothesized a correlation between ultrasonographic testicular parenchymal pixel intensity (PI) and semen quality; however to date, no published studies have specifically examined this link. The aim of this study, therefore, was to assess the relationship between testicular parenchymal PI (measured using trans-scrotal ultrasonography) and semen quality (measured at BBSE), and the usefulness of <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> as an aid in predicting future fertility in bulls, in particular those that are deemed subfertile at the first examination. A total of 162 bulls from 35 farms in the South East of Scotland were submitted to routine BBSE and <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> between March and May 2014, and March and May 2015. Thirty-three animals failed their initial examination (BBSE 1) due to poor semen quality, and were re-examined (BBSE 2) 6 to 8  weeks later.

40|$|Background: Whether extragonadal {{germ cell}} tumors develop {{primarily}} in the retroperitoneum or whether they are essentially metastases of a primary testicular tumor has long been debated and remains controversial. Patients and methods: Three patients presenting with apparent primary extragonadal retroperitoneal germ cell tumors are reported. Ipsilateral testicular evaluation was extended with palpation, ultrasonography and finally histological examination. Results: The retroperitoneal extragonadal tumors were found during abdominal MSCT It was a fortuitous finding in the two first patients. The third patient presented with abdominal pain attributed to necrosis of the large mass which was subsequently firstly drained through endoscopic ultrasound-guided transduodenal puncture. The seminomatous nature of the retroperitoneal tumors was obtained through transduodenal echoendoscopic-guided cytopuncture in the first case, celioscopic resection in the second case and delayed percutaneous CT guided biopsy in the third symptomatic case. The first two patients {{had a history of}} cryptorchidism with substantial clinical <b>testicular</b> atrophy; <b>ultrasonography</b> showed microlithiasis and a small intratesticular tumor in the first patient and an hypoechoic but rather homogeneous atrophic testis in the other; orchiectomy confirmed small seminomatous intratesticular tumors in the two cases. The third patient had an atypical hypoechoic area on testicular ultrasound and histopatholgy revealed a burn-out primary tumor. Conclusions: So-called primary extragonadal retroperitoneal germ cell tumors are extremely rare and should first be considered as metastases of a viable or burned-out testicular cancer until proven otherwise. All ipsilateral testicular abnormalities revealed by the patient's history, clinical examination and mostly by testicular ultrasound must be treated adequately with orchiectomy because they may act as a sanctuary for later tumor growth...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Primary extragonadal {{germ cell}} tumors (EGCT) are rare {{and it is}} still a matter of debate if they have to be {{considered}} as primary extragonadal issues or metastases from a primary testicular neoplasm. We describe two cases of the so-called burned-out seminoma, a primary testicular germ-cell tumor that spontaneously regressed after demonstration of retroperitoneal metastases. Cases presentation: Two patients (35 and 50 years old, respectively) presented with CT findings of retroperitoneal masses. In both cases physical examination of the testis was not suspicious, and only scrotal ultrasound (SUS) showed parenchymal alterations such as scarring, calcifications and nodular lesions. Left orchiectomy and chemotherapy were then performed in both cases. Currently, they are both free of disease. Conclusions: Although primary germ cell tumors may be of retroperitoneal origin, the likelihood of metastasis from a testicular primary origin should always be carefully considered in order to avoid misdiagnosis and to apply the best treatment schedule for the patients. Therefore, a <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is mandatory in patients presenting CT findings of retroperitoneal adenopathy, even if patients are completely asymptomatic and their physical examination appears norma...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} case of {{enucleation}} of a non-palpable right testicular lesion found incidentally at <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> during investigations in a patient with azoospermia. Materials and methods: In 2011 bilateral hypoechoic nonpalpable testicular lesions (5 mm and 3 mm to the right, 3 mm to the left) were found in a 28 years old patient, during diagnostic investigations for azoospermia. In March 2016, ultrasonography showed that {{the diameter of the}} right major nodule had grown to 12 mm, characterized by increased vascularization and increased texture. Blood exams showed serum FSH above normal levels with negative oncologic markers. The patients underwent surgical enucleation of the right nodule under ultrasonography guidance.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} using bleeding from the cut surface of testicular tissue during surgery for testicular torsion to assess testicular viability, compared with the duration of symptoms and preoperative findings on <b>testicular</b> Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> (DUS). Patients and methods The study comprised 19 children with testicular torsion who underwent surgery; all underwent DUS before surgery. During surgery the tunica vaginalis of the affected gonad was incised and a deep incision made through the medulla after obtaining a wedge biopsy for histological examination. After waiting up to 10 min to assess any fresh arterial bleeding from the cut surface, the patients were categorized using three grades; grade I (sufficient bleeding, i. e. bleeding or oozing when the biopsy was obtained); grade II (insufficient bleeding, no bleeding immediately after the incision but starting within 10 min); and grade III (no bleeding within 10 min). The final surgical {{decision on whether to}} save the testis was made according to the grade of testicular tissue bleeding; grade I and II testes were saved and grade III testes were removed. The biopsies were histopathologically examined and classified as haemorrhagic, necrotic or indeterminate. The patients were followed up at 15 days and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, with the affected testis examined using DUS. At the end of the study, the sensitivity and specificity of the duration of symptoms, characteristics of blood flow on DUS and grading of testicular tissue bleeding at surgery were calculated for predicting testis viability, using the histopathological diagnosis as the reference standard.

40|$|Aim Accurate {{calculations}} of testicular volume standard deviation (SD) scores are not currently available. We constructed LMS-smoothed age-reference charts for testicular volume in healthy boys. Methods The LMS method {{was used to}} calculate reference data, based on <b>testicular</b> volumes from <b>ultrasonography</b> and Prader orchidometer of 769 healthy Dutch boys aged 6 months to 19 years. We also explored the association between testicular growth and pubic hair development, and data were compared to orchidometric testicular volumes from the 1997 Dutch nationwide growth study. Results The LMS-smoothed reference charts showed that no revision {{of the definition of}} normal onset of male puberty - from nine to 14 years of age - was warranted. In healthy boys, the pubic hair stage SD scores corresponded with testicular volume SD scores (r = 0. 394). However, testes were relatively small for pubic hair stage in Klinefelter's syndrome and relatively large in immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 deficiency syndrome. Conclusion The age-corrected SD scores for testicular volume will aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of abnormalities in the timing and progression of male puberty and in research evaluations. The SD scores can be compared with pubic hair SD scores to identify discrepancies between cell functions that result in relative microorchidism or macroorchidism. © 2015 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

40|$|Recent reports show that, in {{patients}} treated with finasteride for male pattern hair loss, persistent side effects including sexual side effects, depression, anxiety and cognitive complaints may occur. We here explored the psychiatric and andrological features of patients affected by post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and verified whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of neuroactive steroids (i. e., important regulators of nervous function) are modified. We found that {{eight out of}} sixteen PFS male patients considered suffered from a DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, all PFS patients showed erectile dysfunction (ED); in particular, ten patients showed a severe and six a mild-moderate ED. We also reported abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials of the pudendal nerve in PFS patients with severe ED, the first objective evidence of a neuropathy involving peripheral neurogenic control of erection. <b>Testicular</b> volume by <b>ultrasonography</b> was normal in PFS patients. Data obtained on neuroactive steroid levels also indicate interesting features. Indeed, decreased levels of pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolite (i. e., dihydroprogesterone), dihydrotestosterone and 17 beta-estradiol and increased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol were observed in CSF of PFS patients. Neuroactive steroid levels were also altered in plasma of PFS patients, however these changes did not reflect exactly what occurs in CSF. Finally, finasteride did not only affect, as expected, the levels of 5 alpha-reduced metabolites of progesterone and testosterone, but also the further metabolites and precursors suggesting that this drug has broad consequence on neuroactive steroid levels of PFS patients...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Testicular microlithiasis {{becomes a}} greater {{interdisciplinary}} issue among urologists, andrologists, gynecologists dedicated to reproductive medicine, pediatricians, radiologists and pathologists. Proposed management ranges from benign neglect, instructing self-examination over follow-up once, regular biannual follow-up including ultrasonography to bilateral testicular biopsy {{to rule out}} possible concomitant unclassified intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) or future development of testicular cancer. The aim of this review is to present {{an overview of the}} current dilemma and summarize management trends based on the most recent data. RECENT FINDINGS: Testicular microlithiasis is not a premalignant condition but may accompany ITGCN or testicular cancer. The importance of ruling out ITGCN with testicular biopsy in high-risk men, such as in those with bilateral testicular microlithiasis, infertility, cryptorchidism, atrophic testes or contralateral testicular cancer, has been recently advocated. SUMMARY: Despite greater awareness of testicular microlithiasis, a clear definition is currently missing and the etiology is still obscure. This causes confusion in management and follow-up. Self-examination alone or in combination with <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> has been advised. Recently, a single set of biopsies in selected, high-risk groups has been proposed to rule out ITGCN without a need for further investigations apart from self-examination. However, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy needs to be evaluate...|$|E
40|$|Fertility after orchidopexied undescended testes (UDT) is impaired. Although {{fertility}} {{parameters are}} known to be more favorable in unilateral cases than in bilateral cases, the exact contribution of the unilateral orchidopexied UDT to fertility is unknown. We used testicular (18) F-fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) -uptake assessed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to investigate the function of the orchidopexied unilateral congenital UDT, compared to its normally descended counterpart. We hypothesize that the contribution of the orchidopexied unilateral congenital UDT to fertility in adulthood is low. Eleven men who underwent orchidopexy for congenital UDT at the age of 1. 9 ± 1. 4 (range, 4. 5 months - 4. 0) years were seen in follow-up at the age of 24. 1 ± 2. 3 (20. 6 - 28. 0) years. All underwent physical examination, <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and PET/CT. Testicular (18) F-FDG-uptake was expressed as the peak Standardized Uptake Value (SUVpeak). The mean SUVpeak of the orchidopexied UDT was 2. 74 ± 0. 48 (2. 13 - 3. 47), which was significantly lower than its counterpart (P = 0. 021).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess, in a 12 -year {{prospective}} study, {{the potential}} for early detection of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) by immunocytochemistry, using anti-placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) monoclonal antibodies on testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimens taken {{from a group of}} formerly cryptorchid patients, as such men are at greater risk of developing testicular cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight men who had had orchidopexy at the Urological Department of the University of Padova between 1975 and 1983 were evaluated first in 1993, by a protocol including a history, physical examination, <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and serum tumour markers, to eliminate the presence of testicular cancer. In 57 of the 68 men, specimens taken from bilateral testicular FNAC were stained immunocytochemically using anti-PLAP monoclonal antibodies. After 8 years, the same protocol was repeated on the 57 men, and the follow-up was prolonged until March 2005 for men with previous positive PLAP immunostaining. RESULTS: In 1993, six of the 57 men, (10. 5 %) had unilateral positive immunostaining for PLAP. By 2001, none of these men had developed testicular cancer, while of the other 51 men, only one developed a nonseminomatous tumour. The uninterrupted surveillance of PLAP-positive men showed no overt cancer until March 2005. CONCLUSION: The present findings do not seem to confirm the reliability of PLAP immunostaining of testicular specimens from FNAC for detecting CIS. These findings might depend on the geographical variability of both CIS and testicular cancer incidence, {{as well as on the}} variable relationship between CIS and successive occurrence of invasive testis cancer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Several {{cases of}} {{testicular}} adrenal rest tumours {{have been reported}} in men with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to the classical form of 21 -hydroxylase deficiency but the prevalence has not been established. The aims of this report were to evaluate the frequency of testicular adrenal rest tissue in this population in a retrospective multicentre study involving eight endocrinology centres, and to determine whether treatment or genetic background {{had an impact on the}} occurrence of adrenal rest tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Testicular adrenal rest tissue (TART) was sought clinically and with ultrasound examination in forty-five males with CAH due to the classical form of 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. When the diagnosis of testicular adrenal rest tumours was sought, good observance of treatment was judged on biological concentrations of 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP), delta 4 -androstenedione, active renin and testosterone. The results of affected and non-affected subjects were compared. RESULTS: TART was detected in none of the 18 subjects aged 1 to 15 years but was detected in 14 of the 27  subjects aged more than 15 years. Five patients with an abnormal echography result had no clinical signs. Therapeutic control evaluated at diagnosis of TART seemed less effective when diagnosis was made in patients with adrenal rest tissue compared to TART-free subjects. Various genotypes were observed in patients with or without TART. CONCLUSION: Due to the high prevalence of TART in classical CAH and the delayed clinical diagnosis, <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> must be performed before puberty and thereafter regularly during adulthood even if the clinical examination is normal...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{development}} and application of techniques to assess the reproductive status of male echidnas. The pattern of testosterone secretion over a 24 -h period in five echidnas was documented. Testosterone secretion after injection i. m. of either 1000 IU hCG (n = 4) or 4 mu g GnRH agonist (n = 6) was determined to establish whether this {{could be used as}} a practical index of the prevailing steroidogenic capacity of the testes. hCG (1000 IU) was also used to assess seasonal changes in testosterone secretion in six echidnas over a 13 -month period. Seasonal changes in testicular Volume were examined by transabdominal ultrasonography. Electroejaculation was attempted to monitor seasonal changes in sperm production, which was also determined by spermatorrhea. There was no apparent diurnal pattern of testosterone secretion in echidnas and circulating concentrations of testosterone remained relatively low (maximum 1. 2 ng/mL) and stable over 24 h. Injection of hCG resulted in an increase (P < 0. 01; n = 4) in testosterone concentration with a peak (2. 9 +/- 0. 3 ng/mL) approximately 4 h after injection. GnRH also induced an increase (P < 0. 01; n = 6) in circulating testosterone that was apparent after 1 h (2. 6 +/- 0. 3 ng/mL) and concentrations remained elevated (3. 4 +/- 0. 3 ng/mL) for up to 8 h after injection. Seasonal changes in testosterone secretion determined after injection of hCG, increased (P = 0. 03; n = 6) from late-autumn, peaked in late-winter, and decreased by early-spring. Testicular volume followed a similar seasonal pattern (P < 0. 01; n = 6) with an increase from late-autumn, peak in winter and a decline in mid-spring. There was no seasonal change in live weight. Electroejaculation was attempted throughout two breeding seasons but no semen was obtained. Spermatorrhoea in the echidna was described for the first time and was subsequently used to assess seasonal sperm production. Spermatozoa were found in the urine from June to September. This study has demonstrated that exogenous hormones can be used to obtain an index of the prevailing steroidogenic capacity of the testes in echidnas, which is not apparent with repetitive non-stimulated samples over 24 h. The assessment of testosterone secretion after injection of trophic hormones provides a valuable and practical procedure for the assessment of reproductive status. <b>Testicular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and spermatorrhea are useful in assessing reproductive status and in this study were successfully used to determine seasonal reproduction in captive echidnas.
