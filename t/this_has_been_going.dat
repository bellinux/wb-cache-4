60|$|While <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on, {{the men of}} Harry's escort {{were hard}} at work in getting up the paving stones of the yard, and piling them against the gate. The lower windows were all barred and, as there was no {{entrance}} except by the front gate, {{it was felt that}} they could hold the house for some time.|$|R

Stir up the mud, and you'll get K- {{into the most}} unholy trouble; you'll be in a {{shocking}} box yourself. So will I, {{if you come to}} that. I should like to know how any one of us would look, or what the devil we should have to say for ourselves, in any Christian witness-box. For me, you know there's one thing certain - that, practically speaking, all our subjects have been murdered.' ...|$|E

When Giulia {{was married}} by old Tommaso, {{whom she had}} never seen in her life before the betrothal, the first thing she did was {{to fall in love with}} Giorgio. He fell in love with her, but being a fairly honest sort of man, he had some scruples about {{committing}} adultery with his cousin's wife, especially as he lived on his cousin's money. However, when a woman is vicious, a man's scruples soon go to the devil. If Adam couldn't refuse the apple, you can't expect us poor fallen creatures to do so either. The result was that Joseph did not run away from Potiphar's wife so fast as to prevent her from catching him.' ...|$|E

During those three years I have earned, by disgusting and wearisome labour, just enough to keep me alive in a world which has had nothing to offer me but ugliness and {{discomfort}} and misery. You, as you admitted last time we met, have done no better. You have lived in a garret and gone often hungry to bed. For three years <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on. All that time I have waited for you to bring something human, something reasonable, something warm into my life, and you have failed. I have passed, in those three years, from twenty-three to twenty-six. In three more I shall be in my thirtieth year--that is to say, {{the best time of}} my life will have passed. You see, I have been thinking, and I have had enough." ...|$|E

The {{approach}} of mail-day seemed like a nightmare to the superintendent; he became feverishly nervous like a man under a spell; and, when the mail had gone, behaved like a respited criminal. And <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on two years! Ever since that explosion. Why, it was monomania! ...|$|R
60|$|In a military, {{and also}} in a much deeper sense, he may {{be defined as the}} great Drill-sergeant of the Prussian Nation. Indeed this had been the {{function}} of the Hohenzollerns all along; this difficult, unpleasant and indispensable one of drilling. From the first appearance of Burggraf Friedrich, with good words and with HEAVY PEG, in the wreck of anarchic Brandenburg, and downwards ever since, this has steadily enough gone on. And not a little good drilling these populations have had, first and last; just orders given them (wise and just, which to a respectable degree were Heaven's orders as well): and certainly Heavy Peg, for instance,--Heavy Peg, bringing Quitzow's strong House about his ears,--was a respectable drummer's cat to enforce the same. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on these three hundred years. But Friedrich Wilhelm completes the process; finishes it off to the last pitch of perfection. Friedrich Wilhelm carries it through every fibre and cranny of Prussian Business, and so far as possible, of Prussian Life; so that Prussia is all a drilled phalanx, ready to the word of command; and what we see in the Army is but the last consummate essence of what exists in the Nation everywhere. That was Friedrich Wilhelm's function, made ready for him, laid to his hand by his Hohenzollern foregoers; and indeed it proved a most beneficent function.|$|E

A notice has been sent to every country in Europe. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on ever since we left England, and, so far, without the slightest success. After having been so successful it is hardly likely that the thing will not be attempted again, and in that case it must come before the public. It will be terrible to bear the disgrace alone, but it would be ten times more so did it involve another in my disgrace. Do not pain me by saying more, Captain Armstrong,' and she laid her hand on his arm {{as he was about to}} speak, 'nothing could induce me to change my determination. If at any time this dreadful mystery is cleared up, should you come to me again, I will give you an honest answer. I do not say it will be [...] "Yes." [...] It must be as my heart will decide then. At present my hope is that you will not wait for that: the matter may never be cleared up. I believe, myself, that it never will be, and I would far rather know that you were married to some woman who would make you as happy as you deserve, than that you were wasting your life on me, and that even should I be cleared I might not be able to give you the answer you want.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you.--You do not {{suppose that}} I have ever felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have {{had all this}} hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing {{that it would make}} you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.-- This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy."-- ...|$|E

50|$|According to R.K. Udo (1983), the {{formation}} of volunteer organizations by emigrants {{for the sole purpose}} of helping to develop a city or town, is not a new phenomenon among Nigerians. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on for decades, among several ethnicities even internally, within Nigeria, when people started to leave their hometowns or villages for larger cities, to find work.|$|E
60|$|While <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on, {{a serious}} fight <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raging {{in front of}} Oberglau; and here, as at Blenheim, the allies {{suffered}} disaster. Here the Hanoverians, led by the Prince of Holstein, had attacked. The powerful body of French and Irish infantry did not, however, wait for the assault, but, 9000 strong, charged down the slope upon the 5000 Hanoverians before they had formed up after crossing the river, repulsed them with great loss, and took the prince himself prisoner.|$|R

50|$|Since Islam {{encouraged}} equality {{between the}} sexes, Islam has also encouraged equality in education.

However, in many Arab countries, women do not receive the same educational opportunities as men.|$|E

50|$|While all <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on, some actual {{construction}} <b>had</b> also <b>been</b> worked on. The Taw Vale {{had started}} construction on 5 January 1846, and the Exeter and Crediton had started {{work at the}} end of 1845. In fact at the shareholders' meeting of 24 February 1847 referred to above, Buller had reported that the line was complete and ready, excepting the connection to the B&ER at Cowley Bridge, near Exeter, which could not be made until some formal agreement with the B&ER <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made.|$|R

5000|$|Vilar writes, [...] "Men {{have been}} trained and {{conditioned}} by women, not unlike the way Pavlov conditioned his dogs, into becoming their slaves. As compensation for their labours men are given periodic use of a woman's vagina." [...] The book contends that young boys are encouraged to associate their masculinity with their ability to be sexually intimate with a woman, and that a woman can control a man by socially empowering herself to be the gate-keeper to his sense of masculinity. Vilar states that <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on for some time.|$|E
5000|$|During early {{gestation}} (as {{early as}} 4 weeks) the lingual frenulum {{serves as a}} guide for the forward growth of the tongue. After birth the tip of the tongue continues to elongate, giving the impression of the frenulum retracting, though in reality <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on for some time before birth. This is what gives the impression that the frenulums of some previously tongue-tied infants will [...] "stretch" [...] with age and growth. In reality the tongue often just grows beyond the frenulum, although some do also stretch and/or rupture after mild accidents. Many others continue to cause problems throughout life, unless corrected.|$|E
