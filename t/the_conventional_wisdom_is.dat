25|$|Before the Second World War, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> to use {{converted}} bomber types for airborne photo reconnaissance.

It was soon found that modified Blenheims and Lysanders were easy targets for German fighters and heavy losses were being incurred whenever these aircraft ventured over German territory.|$|R
50|$|Joining a squad that, in {{addition}} to new head coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, also featured plenty of new faces, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that such circumstances would work in Pančev's favour in terms of fitting in.

50|$|Memory {{barriers}} are low-level primitives {{and part of}} an architecture's memory model, which, like instruction sets, vary considerably between architectures, {{so it is not}} appropriate to generalize about memory barrier behavior. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that using memory barriers correctly requires careful study of the architecture manuals for the hardware being programmed.

5000|$|The name Barrio Sur {{was used}} in the past to {{encompass}} the southern neighborhoods.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> {{that his}} delegates would break at least 2:1 {{in favour of}} Mulroney over Clark. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> played out, and Mulroney was elected on the fourth ballot and {{declared}} the winner.A poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark's home province of Alberta, and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney's home province of Quebec.

40|$|With {{the economy}} {{dominating}} today’s headlines and conversations {{it is hard}} to remember that we were preoccupied with economic events during the last decade, too. The 1990 s were mostly a time of tremendous growth and innovation, but they were not without their own trials and crises. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that only one man truly understood what was happening, and he was leading the economy to prosperity amidst the perils of capitalism. Alan Greenspan was a rock star to the political and financial establishments of his time...|$|R
50|$|An inflation-targeting {{central bank}} will raise or lower {{interest}} rates based on above-target or below-target inflation, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that raising interest rates usually cools the economy to rein in inflation; lowering interest rates usually accelerates the economy, thereby boosting inflation. The first three countries to implement fully-fledged inflation targeting were New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, although Germany had adopted many elements of inflation targeting earlier.|$|E
5000|$|In New Jersey, the Secretary of State {{serves a}} term of office {{concurrent}} {{with that of the}} Governor. Although <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that the Secretary of State cannot be removed from office except [...] "for cause" [...] by the Governor or by way of legislative impeachment, a recent law review article argues that the Governor does not have the authority to remove the Secretary of State [...] "for cause," [...] and this issue has not been tested.|$|E
5000|$|The Napoleon {{complex is}} named after Emperor Napoleon I of France. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that Napoleon {{compensated}} for his lack of height by seeking power, war, and conquest.

[...] Napoleon was often seen with his Imperial Guard, which contributed to the perception of his being short because the Imperial Guards were of above average height.|$|E
5000|$|For example, on {{the opening}} play, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that given a roll of 2-1, 4-1, or 5-1, White should move a single checker from point 6 to point 5. Known as [...] "slotting", this {{technique}} trades {{the risk of a}} hit for the opportunity to develop an aggressive position. TD-Gammon found that the more conservative play of 24-23 was superior. Tournament players began experimenting with TD-Gammon's move, and found success. Within a few years, slotting had disappeared from tournament play (it's now reappearing for 2-1, though).|$|R
40|$|Once upon a time, {{law professors}} and {{political}} scientists {{assumed that the}} Supreme Court was, as a practical matter, the final word on matters of statutory interpretation. Although Congress as a formal matter could alter a judicial construction with a statutory amendment, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that it rarely did so. In 1991, that <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> shattered by one of our 2 ̆ 7 s empirical study demonstrating that congressional overrides of Supreme Court statutory interpretation decisions blossomed in the period between 1967 and 1990.

Like his predecessor, Dan Reeves, Fassel had enjoyed great success in his first year, but disappointment in the following two seasons. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> Giants needed {{to have a strong}} year for Fassel to retain his job. The Giants' big draft acquisition was running back Ron Dayne, Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

50|$|Self-perception theory (SPT) is {{an account}} of {{attitude}} formation developed by psychologist Daryl Bem. It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude {{due to a lack}} of experience, etc.—and the emotional response is ambiguous) by observing their own behavior and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states. The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others' behaviors.|$|E
5000|$|Former scholar Steven Hayward has {{described}} {{efforts to reduce}} global warming as being [...] "based on exaggerations and conjecture rather than science".He also has stated that [...] "even though the leading scientific journals are thoroughly imbued with environmental correctness and reject out of hand many articles that don't conform to the party line, a study that confounds <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> published almost every week".Likewise, former scholar Kenneth Green has referred to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as [...] "the positively silly idea of establishing global-weather control by actively managing the atmosphere's greenhouse-gas emissions", and endorsed Michael Crichton's novel State of Fear for having [...] "educated millions of readers about climate science".|$|E
5000|$|Some contrarians have a {{permanent}} bear market view, {{while the majority of}} investors bet on the market going up. However, a contrarian does not necessarily have a negative view of the overall stock market, nor do they have to believe that it is always overvalued, or that <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> always wrong. Rather, a contrarian seeks opportunities to buy or sell specific investments when the majority of investors appear to be doing the opposite, to the point where that investment has become mispriced. While more [...] "buy" [...] candidates are likely to be identified during market declines (and vice versa), these opportunities can occur during periods when the overall market is generally rising or falling.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 {{season was}} {{considered}} a make-or-break year for Fassel. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> that Fassel needed {{to have a strong}} year and a playoff appearance to save his job.

50|$|Bolger championed leeboards as low-tech and practical, to {{the chagrin}} of many yachties. <b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that they are ugly. Even many of his {{centerboard}} designs had boards that were off-center or all the way to {{one side or the other}} (for example, the Birdwatcher and the AS29). He concluded that a single leeboard is sufficient in many cases on small boats, and that rigs could be stepped off the centerline without much effect on performance. Bolger advocated leeboards as being a simple means of providing lateral plane to all types of sailing vessel, eliminating many of the disadvantages of centerboards, daggerboards and keels, following broadly in the concepts of L. Francis Herreshoff, various years his senior and, as stated by Bolger, one of the most influential yacht designers from his perspective.|$|E

5000|$|The Japanese {{giant hornet}} {{is large and}} can be very {{aggressive}} if provoked. Its venom, which is injected by the 6.25 mm-long stinger, attacks the nervous system and damages the tissue of its victims.Tests involving mice found that the venom falls short of being the most lethal of wasp venom, having an [...] of 4.0 mg/kg. In comparison, the deadliest wasp venom (at least to lab mice) by weight belongs to Vespa luctuosa at 1.6 mg/kg. The potency of the sting is due, rather, to the relatively large amount of venom injected. Being stung is extremely painful and can require hospitalization. Asian giant hornet stings can cause anaphylactic shock in allergic people but can still be lethal {{to people who are}} not allergic, provided the dose is sufficient. In China, where the hornet can also be found, <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that people stung more than 10 times need medical help, and emergency treatment if stung more than 30 times. The stings can also cause renal failure. Thirty to forty people die in Japan every year after having been stung by bees and wasps (including the Japanese hornet).|$|E

50|$|In a {{more general}} sense, {{it is used to}} refer to the {{accepted}} truth about something which nearly no one would argue about, and so is used as a gauge (or well-spring) of normative behavior or belief, even within a professional context.

5000|$|American {{courts of}} last resort {{recognize}} a rebuttable presumption against overruling their own past decisions. In earlier eras, people often suggested that this presumption did not apply if the past decision, {{in the view of}} the court's current members, was demonstrably erroneous. But when the Supreme Court makes similar noises today, it is roundly criticized. At least within the academy, conventional wisdom now maintains that a purported demonstration of error is not enough to justify overruling a past decision. ...<b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> wrong to suggest that any coherent doctrine of stare decisis must include a presumption against overruling precedent that the current court deems demonstrably erroneous. The doctrine of stare decisis would indeed be no doctrine at all if courts were free to overrule a past decision simply because they would have reached a different decision as an original matter. But when a court says that a past decision is demonstrably erroneous, it is saying not only that it would have reached a different decision as an original matter, but also that the prior court went beyond the range of indeterminacy created by the relevant source of law. ... Americans from the Founding on believed that court decisions could help [...] "liquidate" [...] or settle the meaning of ambiguous provisions of written law. Later courts generally were supposed to abide by such [...] "liquidations." ... To the extent that the underlying legal provision was determinate, however, courts were not thought to be similarly bound by precedent that misinterpreted it. ... Of the Court's current members, Justices Scalia and Thomas seem to have the most faith in the determinacy of the legal texts that come before the Court. It should come as no surprise that they also seem the most willing to overrule the Court's past decisions. ... Prominent journalists and other commentators suggest that there is some contradiction between these Justices' mantra of [...] "judicial restraint" [...] and any systematic re-examination of precedent. But if one believes in the determinacy of the underlying legal texts, one need not define [...] "judicial restraint" [...] solely in terms of fidelity to precedent; one can also speak of fidelity to the texts themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In his 2009 book, War Stories, {{historian}} and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to {{the myth of}} [...] "Spit-upon veterans". He closely examined Greene's book of letters and the Slate files, {{as well as the}} research by Lindgren and Lembcke. [...] Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene's book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the [...] "surprising number" [...] of veterans who [...] "refuse to believe" [...] the spitting stories, and wrote, [...] "Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible." [...] Kulik also criticized Lindgren's research, writing, [...] "Lindgren's evidence includes only one single first-person ("I was spit upon") account—the stories that {{are at the heart of}} Lembcke's book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed." [...] Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the antiwar movement. [...] "The image of 'hippie' men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false." [...] Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: [...] "There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. ...
