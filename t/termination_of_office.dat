This research was conducted to investigate contractor site security practices for the prevention of construction theft and vandalism. The samples selected for the study were members of the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) of the Construction Science and Management Department at Clemson University, South Carolina. A questionnaire was prepared to obtain data on security measures adopted by the sample and the findings were analyzed using hypothesis testing. Two sets of tests were conducted, dividing the companies on basis of their annual volume for Test-I and dividing the companies on basis of annual loss due to theft for Test-II. Results show the security measures that were found to be statistically significant. Test-I showed differences in security measures including termination of employees caught stealing or committing vandalism, conducting background checks while hiring staff and supervisory personnel, using site security lighting, security fence, after hours security guards, surveillance cameras, LoJack and GPS locators on equipment. Test-II showed differences in security measures including prosecution and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> and subcontractor employees caught stealing and the use of security lighting on the project...|$|E

It considers both protection {{of the member}} and the company. In the first part it analyzes several issues concerning the interpretation of section 66 of the Commercial Code on the basis of judicial decisions. It focuses on the following issues: the purpose of statutory provisions; ways to notify the resignation; on which day the resignation should have been discussed; who is obliged to summon the meeting and what consequences follow the breach of this duty. The Supreme Court has ruled that the protection of a company and its director is equally important. Resignation can be notified either at the meeting or delivered to the company. The director is obliged to do whatever may be reasonably required of him to ensure the organ concerned is given a real opportunity to discuss the resignation. If the director does not fulfill their duties and the resignation is not discussed, their tenure will not end. The end of the tenure cannot always be conditioned by convening the general meeting or placing the discussion of the resignation on the agenda.

Business teachers, entry-level office workers, and employers were asked the following questions: 1. What occupational skills are performed by entry-level office workers? 2. What level off education is needed for entry-level office workers? 3. What are the reasons for selecting entry-level office worker applicants? 4. What are the reasons for not selecting entry-level office worker applicants? [...] - 5. What are the areas in which improvement should be made in the preparation <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers? 6. What are the causes for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers ? 7. What are the personal characteristics desired by employers for entry-level office workers? 8. What is the relationship between participation in extracurricular activities in school to the job success <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers? 9. What is the relationship between participation in on-the-job training programs and the job success <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers? 10. What types of methods are used in the selection <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers? 11. What further training is conducted by employers after hiring an entry-level office worker? Procedure The data for this study consisted of information obtained by questionnaires from vocational business teachers, entry-level office workers, and employers <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers. Eighty percent of the 95 teachers surveyed responded, while 72 percent of the 232 businesses surveyed responded to the questionnaire. The data were then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, Scheffe analysis, descriptive analysis and Chi-square programs. Principal Findings There is a difference between the perceptions of vocational business teachers, entry-level office workers, and employers regarding employable qualifications for entry-level office workers in Utah. Teachers indicate a greater frequency and a greater importance for the skills than did employers or employees. However, they do agree on the most important skills and the least important skills. There was a discrepancy among the three groups regarding the skills which were ranked between most important and least important. Teachers gave more importance to skills such as shorthand, filing, and running duplicating machines, while employers and employees gave more emphasis to the skills which require some sort of decision making or human relations skill. The three groups agreed that entry-level office workers need to complete high school before securing a job and that some college training was advisable. Personality was given as the primary reason for selecting entry-level office workers, while inability to communicate with employers was given as the primary reason for not hiring entry-level office workers. Once hired, making costly mistakes continuously was the reason given by the three groups for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> entry-level <b>office</b> workers. Teachers viewed the ability to follow suggestions and instructions, employers the concern for productivity, and employees the ability to write and speak effectively as the areas most in need of improvement for entry-level office workers. Interviewing was the most common method used by employers in selecting entry-level office workers.
