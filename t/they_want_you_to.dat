500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E

Lovato {{said that it was}} [...] "important" [...] to have them on her album, because [...] "I mean, just look at how {{successful}} they are. I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame". She said, [...] "You get to Hollywood {{and a lot of times}} people can try to shape you and mould you into what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood." [...] "La La Land" [...] was released as the album's second and final single on April 10, 2009. It was later released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 2009, with the new song [...] "Behind Enemy Lines". A CD single was released on June 1, 2009, with a recorded live version of the Camp Rock song [...] "This Is Me" [...] from [...]|$|E

[...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do is shut up. I'm {{not very good at}} shutting up."

2500|$|After {{his return}} in 1855, Hunt founded the first American {{architectural}} school at his Tenth Street Studio Building (beginning with only four students), co-founded the American Institute of Architects and from 1888 to 1891 {{served as the}} Institute's third president, brought the first apartment building to Manhattan {{in a burst of}} scandal, and set a new ostentatious style of grand houses for the social elite and the eccentric, competitive new millionaires of the Gilded Age. His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've got to remember is that it's your client's money you're spending.

2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, the way that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders {{of the people that}} buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [...] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
