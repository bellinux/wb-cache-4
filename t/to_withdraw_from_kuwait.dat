25|$|Operation Desert Shield {{commenced}} in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The 8th SOS was {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia {{as a deterrent}} against the Iraqi threat to its southern neighbor. In January 1991, when Iraq failed to comply with United Nations directives <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> the proven skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Operation Desert Shield escalated into Operation Desert Storm. The 8th SOS {{played a pivotal role}} in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping 11 15,000-pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters.|$|E
500|$|The air {{campaign}} against Iraq began on January 17, 1991, after 139 days {{of planning and}} buildup. Schwarzkopf sent a prepared statement to the troops ahead of the first airstrikes, which were timed to hit their targets at 02:40. He oversaw the strikes from his war room in Riyadh, then emerged from his command center {{late in the day}} on January 18 to speak to the press, saying the air war had gone [...] "just about exactly as we had intended it to go". He then began making frequent briefings to the media to increase press coverage of the results. He declined to measure the success of the campaign by counting suspected Iraqi casualties, believing this would undermine his credibility. The {{air campaign}} proved to be a success by achieving air superiority and destroying the Iraqi military's communications network, supplies, as well as many tanks and armored vehicles. By January 20 he announced Iraq's nuclear test reactors had been destroyed, and by January 27 he announced that the coalition had total air superiority in Iraq. Bush then gave Hussein an ultimatum <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by 12:00 on February 23 or Schwarzkopf's ground forces would attack.|$|E
2500|$|International affairs {{drove the}} Bush presidency. Bush helped the country {{navigate}} {{the end of}} the Cold War and a new era of U.S.–Soviet relations. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush successfully pushed for the reunification of Germany. He also led an international coalition of countries which forced Iraq <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in the Gulf War, and undertook a U.S. military invasion of Panama. Though it was not ratified until after his presidency, Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which created a trilateral trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} {{diplomatic}} {{career in the}} mid-1980s {{when he joined the}} United States Department of State. In the lead up to the Gulf War, Helal interpreted for Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi emissary Tariq Aziz at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, at which time Aziz was presented with an ultimatum <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Iraq {{agrees to}} a Soviet-proposed {{cease-fire}} agreement. The US rejected the proposal {{but said that}} retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave twenty-four hours for Iraq <b>to</b> begin <b>withdrawing</b> forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
50|$|On June 25, {{the first}} batch of the 600-member {{contingent}} began <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> Samawah <b>to</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The last 220 troops left Iraq by July 18. And the JIRSG base in Samawah was planned {{to be the new}} headquarters of the 2nd Brigade, 10th Division of the Iraqi Army.|$|R
50|$|Iraq's refusal <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> {{led to the}} Gulf War and the {{eventual}} return of the pre-occupation Kuwaiti government on 26 February 1991.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678 {{which gave}} Iraq until 15 January 1991 <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and {{empowered}} states to use [...] "all necessary means" [...] to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline.|$|E
50|$|On August 28, 1990, the Kuwaiti {{territory}} {{was transformed}} into the Kuwait Governorate, Iraq's 19th province, and thus it was formally annexed. Iraq's refusal <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> led to the Persian Gulf War, and on 26 February 1991 the pre-occupation government was returned to power.|$|E
50|$|The Geneva Peace Conference {{was held}} on January 9, 1991 to find a {{peaceful}} solution to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait {{in order to avoid}} a war between Iraq and the United States backed coalition. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz represented Iraq, while United States Secretary of State James Baker was the United States representative. Lasting nearly seven hours, both parties refused to move on their initial positions. Iraq refused <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> occupied <b>Kuwait,</b> while the United States and its allies continued to demand Iraq's immediate withdrawal. The meeting was the final initiative that eventually led to the Gulf War.|$|R
25|$|During {{the period}} of {{negotiations}} and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the Palestinian problem by promising <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> his forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.|$|R
50|$|In November 1990, President Bush ordered United States Central Command {{to begin}} to prepare for {{offensive}} operations against Iraq after negotiations with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq were at an impasse. The 416th TFW was deployed from Tonopah in mid-December and in January 1991, {{a portion of the}} 417th TFS was also deployed to Saudi Arabia. In spite of the massive Coalition buildup, Saddam Hussein of Iraq stubbornly refused <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> his troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On Nov. 8, 1990, the 1st Armored Division {{received}} {{orders to}} deploy to Southwest Asia {{to provide an}} offensive option, should Saddam refuse <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> This provided an abrupt change of focus for the division, from a U.S. forces [...] "build down" [...] in Europe to a sudden [...] "buildup" [...] in Southwest Asia.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678 {{which gave}} Iraq until 15 January 1991 <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and {{empowered}} states to use [...] "all necessary means" [...] to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline. The Resolution requested Member States {{to keep the}} Council informed on their decisions. This was the legal authorisation for the Gulf War, as Iraq did not withdraw by the deadline.|$|E
50|$|In late December 1990, 2/4 {{deployed}} by air to Al Jabayl, Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield. During Operation Desert Storm {{the battalion}} fought as a Mechanized Infantry Armor Task force (Task Force Spartan) during the 2nd Marine Division's attack into Kuwait. After the cease fire the battalion remained in Kuwait with Eighth Marines and conducted security and contingency operations west of Kuwait City. 2/4 {{was the last}} Marine infantry battalion <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> arriving in the U.S. on 15 May 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Iraqi {{invasion}} and occupation of Kuwait was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally {{considered to be}} close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum <b>to</b> Iraq <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> its forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
25|$|A UN-brokered ceasefire became {{active in}} July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war. Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his {{image in the}} West by visiting other countries, and by {{appearing}} at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail. The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in {{what became known as}} the Gulf War. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's. After informing the then American president George H. W. Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> Iraqi troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved. On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution. Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicionthey distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth.|$|R
50|$|After an {{argument}} between Wiener and Al Hadithi, Al Hadithi agrees to give CNN a Saddam Hussein interview. On October 29, Bernard Shaw (Robert Wisdom) and the CNN crew interview Saddam Hussein {{at one of}} his presidential palaces. In the interview, Hussein states that Iraq <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> would be like the U.S. <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii. The crew then covers the release of American hostages from Iraq. Wiener then finds Bob Vinton and is emotionally moved by his being safe.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctions}} against Iraq were a near-total financial and trade embargo {{imposed by the}} United Nations Security Council on Ba'athist Iraq. They began August 6, 1990, four days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, stayed largely in force until May 2003 (after Saddam Hussein's being forced from power), and persisted in part, including reparations to Kuwait, through the present. The original stated purposes of the sanctions were to compel Iraq <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> to pay reparations, and to disclose and eliminate any weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1990, Iraq made a {{proposal}} <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> provided that foreign troops left {{the region and}} that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel's and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The White House rejected the proposal. The PLO's Yasser Arafat expressed that neither he nor Saddam insisted that solving the Israel-Palestine issues should be a precondition to solving the issues in Kuwait, though he did acknowledge a [...] "strong link" [...] between these problems.|$|E
50|$|On 27 October 1990, the two {{countries}} along with Cuba and Yemen voiced concerns over a UN resolution that would make Iraq responsible for financial repercussions relating to the Invasion of Kuwait. Eventually an agreement was made to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and end the Gulf War. The war would eventually end on 28 February 1991 with {{the intervention of the}} Coalition of the Gulf War. Although Malaysia and Colombia supported the UN's authorised use of force against Iraq, neither countries participated directly in the Coalition.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, the US {{stuck to}} its {{position}} {{that there would}} be no negotiations until Iraq <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and that they should not grant Iraq concessions, lest they give the impression that Iraq benefited from its military campaign. Also, when US Secretary of State James Baker met with Tariq Aziz in Geneva, Switzerland, for last minute peace talks in early 1991, Aziz reportedly made no concrete proposals and did not outline any hypothetical Iraqi moves.|$|R

50|$|The Invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 was a 2-day {{operation}} {{conducted by}} Iraq against the neighboring state of Kuwait, {{which resulted in}} the seven-month-long Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. This invasion and Iraq's subsequent refusal <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by a deadline mandated by the United Nations led to military intervention by a United Nations-authorized coalition of forces led by the United States. These events {{came to be known as}} the first Gulf War and resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the Iraqis setting 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire during their retreat.|$|E

50|$|Fellow Arab {{countries}} {{called for}} Saddam {{to comply with}} Resolution 678. Egyptian President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak and Saudi King Fahd, along with other heads of state, publicly called for an unconditioned withdrawal from Kuwait. Syrian Minister of Defense Mustafa Tlas stated Syria would increase its military presence if Iraq did not comply. After a meeting in Cairo on December 3, 1990, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt issued a statement that stated “Bush’s initiative creates the last chance for removing the danger of war from the region. Saddam had better seize this opportune moment <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> rather than embroil the region in a bloody and futile war.|$|E
50|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded {{neighboring}} Kuwait and U.S. {{military forces}} moved into Saudi Arabia {{as part of}} Operation Desert Shield to protect that country against invasion by Iraq.

5000|$|The United States {{amassed a}} 30 nation {{coalition}} of some 30,000 {{troops and the}} UN Security Council issued an ultimatum to Iraq for the withdrawal. Operation Desert Storm, an air bombardment, followed by a 43-day war followed Iraq's failure <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) provided vessels for the multi-national naval force, patrolling the Persian Gulf to enforce the UN sanctions. The Government elected to maintain an Australian naval presence in the Gulf following the surrender of Iraq and 1991 Peace Treaty. Ultimately, though Iraq <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> its failure <b>to</b> adhere to other conditions of the 1991 Treaty led to the second Iraq War a decade later.
