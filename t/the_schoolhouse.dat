5|$|Strang School District No. 36, or the Strang Public School, is a {{historic}} school located in Fillmore County, Nebraska, {{in the village of}} Strang. The school is one of the two sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the village of Strang. The school building is a small, two-story, brick public schoolhouse, which was built to replace <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> that was previously located on that site. <b>The</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> was built between 1929 and 1930, and replaced the previous schoolhouse, which burned down in 1928. <b>The</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> still retains all original building materials. The school served high school students from 1930 to 1951, and still functions as a school today, serving grades K–8. The NRHP listing also includes a flagpole located outside <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse,</b> and five pieces of playground equipment.|$|E

In 1900, <b>the</b> second Purdy <b>Schoolhouse</b> was built to replace it on land (also donated by Knapp) located on Sherman Avenue (present-day 68th Avenue). Students spent every other semester at either <b>the</b> Purdy <b>Schoolhouse,</b> or <b>the</b> Wauna <b>Schoolhouse</b> to keep both schools active. [...] The modern-day Peninsula High School now sits on the hill where one of <b>the</b> original <b>schoolhouses</b> was built. <b>The</b> Second <b>schoolhouse</b> stood until 2015, when it was demolished {{to build a new}} home.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the brick schoolhouse that faces west onto Constitution Square and stands between the Watts-Bell House and Grayson's Tavern. Local {{tradition}} holds that it dates to approximately {{the same time as}} the buildings near it and that it housed a private school. According to the Danville-Boyle County Convention and Visitors Bureau, it was constructed around 1820 and was the first brick schoolhouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. The single-story, two-room edifice is built upon a fieldstone foundation with brick laid in common bond and an off-center entrance with a transom above. While Constitution Square was a part of the state park system, the park manager lived in <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse.</b> After the park's transfer to Boyle County, <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> was converted into a conference center with meeting space.|$|E
5|$|Drama dari Krakatau {{was first}} {{published}} in serial form in Kwee's magazine Panorama, between 7 April and 22 December 1928. This serial was then published as a novel by Hoa Siang In Kiok in 1929. A new printing, adopting the 1972 spelling reform, was included in the second volume of Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia, an anthology of Chinese Malay literature. This volume also included Kwee's novella Roema Sekola jang Saja Impiken (<b>The</b> <b>Schoolhouse</b> of My Dreams; 1925) and the novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang; 1927).|$|E
50|$|A {{piece of}} land was donated on January 9, 1804 by Jacob Van Winkle for the {{construction}} of a school. <b>The</b> first <b>schoolhouse</b> was erected that year at a cost of $162.20. <b>The</b> first <b>schoolhouse</b> was replaced in 1849 by a two-story frame building. This second schoolhouse was torn down in 1893 and replaced by the current building at a cost of $2,541.83. The cupola and bell from <b>the</b> second <b>schoolhouse</b> were salvaged and added to <b>the</b> current <b>schoolhouse.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Strang Public School is {{positioned}} {{at the intersection}} of Main Street and Sharon Street, on the southern edge of Strang, originally planned as a convenient location for the teachers and students coming from surrounding communities. The campus consists of the main schoolhouse, five historic pieces of playground equipment, a flagpole located in front of the building, a basketball/tennis court located north of the school building, and a large playing field west of <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse.</b> The entire property is contained inside a 300 by 300 foot square plot of land.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> {{was built}} in 1883, {{in the village of}} Chana, Illinois. Due to the {{elimination}} of the Chana School District, the school was abandoned by the 1960s. A restoration effort was undertaken in the late 1990s, ending with a move and refurbishment in 2002 and 2003. The building now stands in a public park along the Rock River in Oregon, Illinois. Its interior also features architectural elements which set it apart from the typical 19th-century schoolhouse. From a distance, the building is dominated by its bell tower.|$|E
5|$|Raised by teachers, William Halliday also {{believed}} {{in the value of}} education. One of the original buildings in Hallidayboro, <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> followed the overall architecture scheme of the village. Nestled at the west end of Main Street, the frame schoolhouse accommodated forty students. Typical of the period, separated entrances for boys and girls appeared under the twin bell towers. It is also likely that Halliday maintained a book collection {{for the use of the}} residents of his company town. In his home city he served on the Cairo Library Board and he endowed the Cairo Library with $5,000.00 in his will. A high degree of literacy existed in Hallidayboro.|$|E

5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse,</b> save the limestone and cement foundation. At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{first level}} of the {{building}} contains two classrooms, {{both of which have}} a cloakroom, a set of three swivel doors, and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls. The first story also contains two bathrooms, four small storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor. The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms. A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. <b>The</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E
5|$|The log {{church was}} moved from its {{original}} location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill {{across the road from}} the brick church. It was used as a sexton's house for the church, and was a Sunday school classroom for about 30 years. In addition to religious instruction, the log building was a public schoolhouse. Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother, the judge Garnett Kerr Kump, received part of their primary education in <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse.</b> By 1885, a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school. The log building succumbed to the elements, and no longer exists.|$|E

25|$|The first trooper {{had arrived}} at {{approximately}} 10:42, {{about six or seven}} minutes after the 9-1-1 call. The police, while waiting for reinforcements, attempted to communicate with Roberts via the PA system in their patrol cars. They asked Roberts to throw out his weapons and exit <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse.</b> Roberts refused, again ordering the officers to leave. By 11:00a.m. a large crowd—including police officers, emergency medical technicians, and residents of the village—had assembled both outside <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> and at a nearby ambulance staging area. County and state police dispatchers had briefly established telephone contact with Roberts as he continued to threaten violence against the children.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{consists}} of several buildings: two older stone structures, <b>the</b> <b>schoolhouse</b> built in 1930 {{and the former}} chapel (now used as a gym/multipurpose room) built in 1938–39; and two more modern pre-fabricated modular buildings which were erected {{in the mid to}} late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The first schoolhouse in Stouffville was on Church St., {{just north}} of Main St., where the United Church {{building}} stands.

25|$|British-Hanoverian Bremen-Verden {{retained}} the Amt Himmelpforten, then Royal and Electoral Bailiwick of Himmelpforten (i.e. Königliches und Churfürstliches Ampt Himmelpforten) as a rather administrative subdivision, but reorganised it {{according to the}} Hanoverian Bailiwick Ordinance (Amtsordnung) of 1674.
