5|$|To produce horses {{with some}} Arabian {{characteristics}} but coat colors {{not found in}} purebreds, {{they have to be}} crossbred with other breeds. Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors, they do not appear to carry any color-based lethal disorders such as the frame overo gene ("O") that can produce lethal white syndrome (LWS). Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS foals, Arabian mares were used as a non-affected population in some of the studies seeking <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> caused the condition in other breeds. Nonetheless, partbred Arabian offspring can, in some cases, carry these genes if the non-Arabian parent was a carrier.|$|E
5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E
5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> expressions profile {{related to}} the oxidative stress and the antioxidant response in the kidneys of mice subjected to intestinal ischemia and reperfusion. METHODS: Twelve inbred mice (C 57 BL/ 6) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups: the control group (CG) underwent anesthesia and was observed for 120 min and the ischemia/reperfusion group (IRG), animals were anesthetized and subjected to laparotomy and ischemia for 60 minutes followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. The expressions of 84 <b>genes</b> from <b>the</b> kidney were determined by the Reverse Transcription qualitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). All <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were up regulated by more than threefold using the algorithm [2 (&# 916;&# 916;Ct) ] were considered statically significant (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: In the IRG group 29 (34. 52 %) of 84 genes, were up regulated by more than threefold. <b>The</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were differentially up regulated in the glutathione peroxidase cluster (10 genes) : were Gpx 2 and Gpx 7. <b>The</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were up regulated in the peroxidase cluster (16 genes) were following: Duox 1, Epx, Lpo, Mpo, Ptgs 2, Rag 2, Serpinb 1 b, Tmod 1 and Tpo. <b>The</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> up regulated in the reactive oxygen species cluster (16 genes) : Il 19, Il 22, Nos 2, Nox 1, Noxa 1, Noxo 1, Recql 4 and Sod 2. <b>The</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were up regulated in the oxidative stress cluster (22 genes) were: Mpp 4, Nudt 15, Upc 3 and Xpa. <b>The</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were up regulated in the oxygen carriers cluster (12 genes) were: Hbq 1, Mb, Ngb, Slc 38 a 1 and Xirp 1. <b>The</b> peroxiredoxins <b>genes</b> (10) showed no consistent differential regulation.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{defective}} enzyme in PNH is phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIGA), {{one of several}} enzymes needed to make GPI. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> codes for PIGA {{is located on the}} X chromosome, which means that only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell (initially, females have two copies, but one is silenced through X-inactivation).

40|$|As a {{tool for}} {{measuring}} the aging process, life span has been invaluable in dissecting <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> modulate longevity.

25|$|The {{process of}} invading the host cell, {{hijacking}} the cellular machinery, replication and final release {{is a complicated}} set of steps. Very specific proteins coded by the DNA of the infectious organism {{as well as the}} host cells allow those steps to happen. Even a very small change in a critical protein might make infection difficult or impossible. Such changes might arise by a process of mutation in <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> codes for the protein. If the change is in the gamete, that is, the sperm or egg that join to form a zygote that grows into a human being, the protective mutation will be inherited. Since lethal diseases kill many persons who lack protective mutations, in time, many persons in regions where lethal diseases are endemic come to inherit protective mutations.|$|E
25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a disease}} of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left atrial is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, and Doberman Pinschers. It is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by taurine deficiency in American Cocker Spaniels or doxorubicin use. A mutation in <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in Doberman Pinschers in the USA. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. Doberman Pinschers more commonly have ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., premature ventricular complexes; ventricular tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).|$|E
25|$|Genes {{encoding}} CYP enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, {{are designated}} with the root symbol CYP for the superfamily, {{followed by a}} number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene.
