40|$|As for a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system, the air duct static pressure {{is a typical}} control variable maintained by modulating supply fan speed. The static pressure equals to the summation of the duct pressure loss downstream of the sensor to <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> and box inlet static pressure. Typically, the air duct static pressure is set as a constant set point based on the system design information and sensor location. However, under partial load conditions, <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> dampers have to be closed more since either required airflow {{is less than the}} design airflow which directly leads to much less pressure loss.

HVAC systems consume energy in excess of the sum total of the building loads. This excess energy use is due to the fact that a single air-handler unit in a HVAC system, having to provide conditioned air at different supply temperatures to different zones in the building, can do so only by resorting to either, (a) a certain amount of mixing of cold and hot air streams as in dual-duct systems, or (b) to reheat at <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> in single-duct systems.

40|$|Single duct Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{systems are}} {{currently}} {{the most widely}} used type of HVAC system in the United States. When installing such a system, it is critical to determine the minimum airflow set point of <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>box,</b> as an optimally selected set point will improve the level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) {{while at the same time}} lower overall energy costs. In principle, this minimum rate should be calculated according to the minimum ventilation requirement based on ASHRAE standard 62. 1 and maximum heating load of the zone. Several factors must be carefully considered when calculating this minimum rate. Terminal boxes with conventional control sequences may result in occupant discomfort and energy waste. If the minimum rate of airflow is set too high, the AHUs will consume excess fan power, and the terminal boxes may cause significant simultaneous room heating and cooling. At the same time, a rate that is too low will result in poor air circulation and indoor air quality in the air-conditioned space. ^ Currently, many scholars are investigating how to change the algorithm of the advanced VAV terminal box controller without retrofitting. Some of these controllers have been found to effectively improve thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency. However, minimum airflow set points have not yet been identified, nor has controller performance been verified in confirmed studies. ^ In this study, control algorithms were developed that automatically identify and reset terminal box minimum airflow set points, thereby improving indoor air quality and thermal comfort levels, and reducing the overall rate of energy consumption. A theoretical analysis of the optimal minimum airflow and discharge air temperature was performed to identify the potential energy benefits of resetting <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> minimum airflow set points. Applicable control algorithms for calculating the ideal values for the minimum airflow reset were developed and applied to actual systems for performance validation. The results of the theoretical analysis, numeric simulations, and experiments show that the optimal control algorithms can automatically identify the minimum rate of heating airflow under actual working conditions. Improved control helps to stabilize room air temperatures. The vertical difference in the room air temperature was lower than the comfort value. Measurements of room CO 2 levels indicate that when the minimum airflow set point was reduced it did not adversely affect the indoor air quality. According to the measured energy results, optimal control algorithms give a lower rate of reheating energy consumption than conventional controls. ...|$|E

40|$|Dual-duct systems {{provide good}} air circulation, require little maintenance, {{and have no}} {{condensation}} at <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes.</b> However, dual-duct systems are believed to consume more energy than single-duct variable air volume systems. To address this issue, an extensive investigation was performed to develop optimal design and control strategies that would improve the performance of dual-duct systems. ^ A dual-fan, dual-duct (DFDD) system is a prominent design improvement in dual-duct systems. The DFDD system recycles warm return air instead of cool mixed air for the hot air supply. Compared to the single-fan, dual-duct (SFDD) system, the DFDD system saves significant amounts of thermal and fan power energy in mild and winter weather conditions. The DFDD system is an optimal design when no heating is supplied in summer. When heating is required in summer, the DFDD system can be further improved by installing an independent outside air opening that directs warm outside air directly to the hot deck. This improved system, called an “energy savings chamber,” reduces or eliminates thermal energy penalties of the DFDD system. The optimal control strategies include an optimal fan control for a single-fan, dual-duct constant volume system, an optimal outside intake sequence for the energy savings chamber, and optimal hot and cold air temperature controls for various kinds of dual-duct systems. System performance in dual-duct systems can be optimized {{with little or no}} additional equipment required. ^ Physical models were also developed to represent the performance of the dual-duct systems. These models are made available to engineers to fully investigate the systems instead of looking at data from a simulation program. ^ This thesis will cover the following: (1) State-of-the-art research in dual-duct systems and related subjects, (2) Physical models for the optimal design and mathematical models for optimal control, (3) Performance analyses of the models, (4) Implementation of the optimal design and control sequences, and (5) Experimental validations of the simulation results. ...|$|R

40|$|Demand control {{ventilation}} (DCV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} energy efficient ways to achieve the optimum indoor air quality. It is capable of delivering the amount of outdoor air into the space as needed. ASHRAE 62. 1 standard recommends the ventilation rate required for a space to protect public health. Thus, the study of DCV has to comply with ASHRAE standard or other similar standards. ^ Considering that the standard is updated every few years, the DCV methods studied under the previous standards also need review. In ASHRAE Standard 62. 1 - 2004, the ventilation rate was updated with a building area related component, which makes the DCV more challenging to implement. ^ Although many studies have been conducted, gaps are still discovered since most of the studies are based on the similar assumptions about <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Box</b> (TBX) minimum airflow setting and normally ignore that the minimum airflow setting greatly influences the zone ventilation rate and system energy consumption. ^ In this dissertation, an innovative IDCV method is proposed, which studied the annual system energy consumption and indoor air quality in terms of zone CO 2 through simulation. Field experiment was conducted as well to validate the proposed method. The result of the proposed method is compared to the other two control methods. One is the widely applied method of setting the outdoor air damper at a fixed position, while the other one is the MZE method introduced in the ASHRAE standard. The simulation results showed that with the proposed method, the system energy consumption was significantly reduced. For cities from 16 climate zones in the US, about 2 % to 27 % savings was created when compared to the method of using 20 % of TBX minimum setting, and 3 % to 40 % of annual savings was achieved when compared to the method of using 30 % of TBX minimum setting. The experiment results showed that the proposed method reduced the airflow of TBXs by 20 % and the supply fan speed by 11 %. Results from both simulation and experiment demonstrated that the zone CO 2 level was well controlled by the proposed method. ...|$|E
40|$|In all {{the three}} domains of life, most RNAs undergo post {{transcriptional}} modifications {{both on the}} bases {{as well as the}} ribose sugars of the individual ribonucleotides. 22 ̆ 7 -O-methylation of ribose sugars and isomerization of Uridines to Pseudouridines are two most predominant modifications in rRNAs and tRNAs across all domains of life. Besides 22 ̆ 7 -O-methylation of ribose sugars, methylation of pseudouridine (Ø) at position 54 of tRNA, producing m 1 Ø, is a hallmark of many archaeal species but the specific methylase involved in the formation of this modification had yet to be characterized. A comparative genomics analysis had previously identified COG 1901 (DUF 358), part of the SPOUT superfamily, as a candidate for this missing methylase family. To test this prediction, the COG 1901 encoding gene, HVO_ 1989, was deleted from the Haloferax volcanii genome. Analyses of modified base contents indicated that while m 1 Ø was present in tRNA extracted from the wild-type strain, it was absent from tRNA extracted from the mutant strain. Expression of the gene encoding COG 1901 from Halobacterium sp. NRC- 1, VNG 1980 C, complemented the m 1 Ø minus phenotype of the ÄHVO_ 1989 strain. This in vivo validation was extended with in vitro tests. Using the COG 1901 recombinant enzyme from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj 1640), purified enzyme Pus 10 from M. jannaschii and full-size tRNA transcripts or TØ-arm (17 -mer) fragments as substrates, the sequential pathway of m 1 Ø 54 formation in Archaea was reconstituted. The methylation reaction is AdoMet-dependent. The efficiency of the methylase reaction depended on the identity of the residue at position 55 of the TØ-loop. The presence of Ø 55 allowed the efficient conversion of Ø 54 to m 1 Ø 54, whereas in the presence of C 55 the reaction was rather inefficient and no methylation reaction occurred if a purine was present at this position. These results led to renaming the Archaeal COG 1901 members as TrmY proteins. Another aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism of target RNA recruitment to a box C/D sRNP. From data obtained, we have made the following hypothesis- aNop 5 p, either alone or as a heterodimer with Fibrillarin, binds to single stranded bulges and loops of target RNA. This aNop 5 p bound target is then hybridized to an assembling guide sRNP complex containing the guide RNA and L 7 Ae or guide RNA, L 7 Ae and aNop 5 p. If the guide:target sequences are complementary to each other, they hybridize and the target nucleotide gets modified. We also think that post modification, the guide and target strands separate, the core proteins rearrange themselves on the guide RNA and then prime the guide RNA for next round of modification. Compared to the general archaeal populations, haloarchaea contain significantly fewer number of box C/D guide RNAs. In archaea, previous studies have underscored the importance of a symmetric assembly of the core proteins on the sRNA. This meant that if the core proteins were unable to bind to either <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> C/D or the internal box C 2 ̆ 7 /D 2 ̆ 7 motifs, the sRNP was not efficient to carry out the modification of the target RNA. Essentially the only two haloarchaeal box C/D sRNPs known before had a symmetric architecture. In this study we discovered the first naturally occurring asymmetric box C/D sRNP called sR- 41 in Haloferax volcannii. The architecture of Haloferax volcanii sR- 41 box C/D sRNP seems to be closer in conformation to eukaryal snoRNPs (eukaryal counterparts of archaeal sRNPs) in which the core proteins assemble asymmetrically on the RNA. Till date, no information regarding the catalytic mechanism of an asymmetrically arranged eukaryal box C/D snoRNPs are available, because of unavailability of any assembly systems or crystal structures. Hence, this archaeal sR- 41 guide sRNP provides a unique opportunity to study mechanism of modification in an asymmetrically arranged box C/D sRNP molecule...|$|E

This control sequence can cause occupant discomfort or use excessive energy under partial load conditions. If the minimum airflow rate is higher than required; <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> will have significantly more simultaneous heating and cooling; and AHUs will consume more fan power. Buildings will have indoor air quality problems if the minimum airflow rate is less than required. Many engineers and researchers have investigated advanced variable air volume <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> control algorithms without a system retrofit for thermal comfort; indoor air quality and energy savings. In this study a developed control system with variable minimum airflow rate for Single Duct Variable Air Volume <b>Terminal</b> <b>Boxes</b> was applied and validated using an actual building and evaluated for comfort; indoor air quality and energy consumption.

The airflow reset lowers the minimum airflow possibility to zero for variable air volume (VAV) <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes,</b> and changes <b>the</b> airflow {{to a lower}} value for constant air volume <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> (CV). It maintains zone temperatures at comfortable levels or daytime set points during unoccupied or lightly occupied hours. It decreases heating, cooling, and fan power significantly.

40|$|Essential {{elements}} for intronic U 14 processing have been analyzed by microinjecting various mutant hsc 70 /Ul 4 pre-mRNA precursors into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Initial truncation experiments revealed that elements sufficient for U 14 processing are {{located within the}} mature snoRNA sequence itself. Subsequent deletions within the U 14 coding region demonstrated that only <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> regions of <b>the</b> folded U 14 molecule containing con- served nucleotide boxes C and D are required for processing. Mutagenesis of either box C or box D completely blocked U 14 processing. The importance of boxes C and D was confirmed with the excision of appropriately sized U 3 and U 8 fragments containing boxes C and D from an hsc 7 O pre-mRNA intron. Competition studies indicate that a trans-acting factor (protein?) is binding this terminal motif and is essential for U 14 processing. Competition studies also revealed that this factor is common to both intronic and non-intronic snoRNAs possessing nucleotide boxes C and D. Immunoprecipitation of full-length and internally deleted U 14 snoRNA molecules demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> region containing <b>boxes</b> C and D does not bind fibrillarin. Collectively, our results indicate that a trans-acting factor (different from fibrillarin) binds to the box C- and D-containing terminal motif of U 14 snoRNA, thereby stabilizing the intronic snoRNA sequence in an RNP complex during processing...|$|R

The CCLEP process was applied to a luxury shopping mall and office building from May 2006 to February 2007. The CCLEP process integrates the Air-Handling Unit (AHU), <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> and central plant as a whole system with retrofit and optimal control strategies. The case study building has ten single fan dual-duct VAV AHUs, 123 dual-duct pneumatic controller pressure independent <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes,</b> and a central heating and cooling plant. Major retrofit efforts include upgrading from pneumatic to DDC controls for all AHUs, installing main hot deck dampers, replacing the boiler, installing VFD on fans and pumps, and installing a Fan Airflow Station (FAS) and Pump Waterflow Station (PWS). This paper presents both the existing and the optimal control schedules, which include static pressure reset integrated with FAS, improved outside air control, supply air temperature reset, retrofit recommendations and optimal control for <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes,</b> and a Pump Waterflow Station (PWS) to improve chilled water pump speed control and ensure minimum water flow requirements for the evaporator.
