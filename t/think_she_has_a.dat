Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, she said [...] " [...] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it". In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, [...] "I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented." ...|$|E

In an interview {{he said he}} had asked Imbruglia to record one of the band's songs adding [...] "we've given her the best Coldplay song of all time [...] she sounds [...] brilliant on it.

[...] She said she recorded two songs written by him saying [...] "if Chris Martin calls with two songs, you don't think, you say, 'Yes'." [...] The songs were mixed by Michael Brauer Two songs – [...] "My God" [...] and [...] "Apologise" [...] – appeared on the Internet [...] The second was written with Jamie Hartman of Ben's Brother and will not be on her fourth album.

2500|$|All My Children's {{wardrobe}} director, David R. Zyla, {{collaborated with}} Braun {{in creating the}} wardrobe for the Reese Williams character. The two had worked together before when Braun portrayed Carly Corinthos on General Hospital. While bringing their ideas together, they tried {{to make sure they}} did not make Reese into too much of a cliché. [...] "I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses," [...] Braun said. Reese's wardrobe goes {{back and forth between the}} two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. [...] "She's an architect, so to me, I would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> real eye for lines," [...] said Braun. [...] "She appreciates form and beauty, and the look we came up with I would describe as 'streamlined with a flair'." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Geoffrey Langford {{shook his}} head. [...] "Not yet," [...] said he. [...] "I {{think it may}} be better after this first night is over.

6000|$|Again that {{challenge}} in his voice, {{and she did}} not answer. Her arms tightened round him, and he returned her kisses; but even while he yielded, the poison worked in him, the poison of the letter. Fleur did not know, she did not understand--she misjudged his mother; she came from the enemy's camp! So lovely, and he loved her so--yet, even in her embrace, he could not help the memory of Holly's words: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 'having' nature," [...] and his mother's [...] "My darling boy, don't think of me--think of yourself!" ...|$|E

Do you remember how she was last fall? I never supposed I should come to love her.

Please God, she and the little one can stand it for a time, and I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> spring within her that will;' then, as he saw tears in his cousin's eyes, he added, 'Don't be unhappy about it, Nuttie; I have had it in my mind ever so long {{to tell you that the}} finding you at Micklethwayte was the best thing that ever {{happened}} to me!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{daughter}} Robina," [...] I said, [...] "is {{just the}} same age--according to years; and Dick is twenty-one. I hope you will be friends with them. They have got sense, both of them. It comes out {{every now and again}} and surprises you. Veronica, I think, is nine. I am not sure how Veronica is going to turn out. Sometimes things happen that make us <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> beautiful character, and then for quite long periods she seems to lose it altogether. The Little Mother--I don't know why we always call her Little Mother--will not join us till things are more ship-shape. She does not like to be thought an invalid, and if we have her about anywhere near work that has to be done, and are not always watching her, she gets at it and tires herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} we are troubled with this sweet little savage; but I {{think she has}} talent, though evidently quite uneducated. We must {{do what we can}} for her. Her ignorance of all {{breeding}} is amusing, but then I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> natural elegance. We shall soon polish her. His Royal Highness is so anxious that every attention should be paid to her. Beckendorff, you know, is a man of the greatest genius." [...] (Madame Carolina had lowered her tone about the Minister since the Prince of Little Lilliput's apostasy.) [...] "The country is greatly indebted to him. This, between ourselves, is his daughter. At least I have no doubt of it. Beckendorff was once married, to a lady of great rank, died early, beautiful woman, very interesting! His Royal Highness had a great regard for her. The Premier, in his bereavement, turned humorist, and has brought up this lovely girl in the oddest possible manner; nobody knows where. Now that he finds it necessary to bring her forward, he, of course, is quite at a loss. His Royal Highness has applied to me. There was a little coldness before between the Minister and myself. It is now quite removed. I must do what I can for her I think she must marry von Sohnspeer, who is no more Beckendorff's son than you are: or young Eberstein, or young Bernstorff, or young Gernsbach. We must do something for her. I offered her last night to Emilius von Aslingen; but he said that, unfortunately, he was just importing a savage or two of his own from the Brazils, and consequently was not in want of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To paint her portrait; she'll {{recapture}} {{you on that}} basis. She'll get {{you down}} {{to one of the}} country-houses, and it will all go off as charmingly--with sketching in the morning, on days you can't hunt, and anything you like in the afternoon, and fifteen courses in the evening; there'll be bishops and ambassadors staying--as if you were a 'well-known,' awfully clever amateur. Take care, take care, for, fickle as you may think me, I can read the future: don't imagine you've {{come to the end of}} me yet. Mrs. Dallow and your sister, of both of whom I speak with the greatest respect, are capable of hatching together the most conscientious, delightful plan for you. Your differences with the beautiful lady will be patched up and you'll each come round a little and meet the other halfway. The beautiful lady will swallow your profession if you'll swallow hers. She'll put up with the palette if you'll put up with the country-house. It will be a very unusual one in which you won't find a good north room where you can paint. You'll go about with her and do all her friends, all the bishops and ambassadors, and you'll eat your cake and have it, and every one, beginning with your wife, will forget there's anything queer about you, and everything will be for the best in the best of worlds; so that, together--you and she--you'll become a great social institution and every one will <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> delightful husband; to say nothing of course of your having a delightful wife. Ah my dear fellow, you turn pale, and with reason!" [...] Nash went lucidly on: [...] "that's to pay you for having tried to make me let you have it. You have it then there! I may be a bore"--the emphasis of this, though a mere shade, testified to the first personal resentment Nick had ever heard his visitor express--"I may be a bore, but once in a while I strike a light, I make things out. Then I venture to repeat, 'Take care, take care.' If, as I say, I respect ces dames infinitely it's because they will be acting according to the highest wisdom of their sex. That's the sort of thing women do for a man--the sort of thing they invent when they're exceptionally good and clever. When they're not they don't do so well; but it's not for want of trying. There's only one thing in the world better than their incomparable charm: it's their abysmal conscience. Deep calleth unto deep--the one's indeed a part of the other. And when they club together, when they earnestly consider, as in the case we're supposing," [...] Nash continued, [...] "then the whole thing takes a lift; for it's no longer the virtue of the individual, it's that of the wondrous sex." ...|$|E
