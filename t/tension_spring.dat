2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of construction with springs. Springs can be {{located on the}} mechanical equivalent of the forearm or the upper arm, or both, as well as nearer the base. Some lamps use tension springs, and others use compression springs. The image at the left shows (left to right) a compression spring at rest, then under load, followed by a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> at rest, and then under load. Springs have a limited lifting capacity and extension length.Some springs can resonate, producing low-level unwanted noise.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{called the}} Barber-Colman Impressor, the Barcol impressor was {{developed}} by Walter Colman as a hand-held, portable means of assessing the hardness of a material during World War II. The United States Army Air Corps required a hand-held method of checking the hardness of rivets due to concerns that aircraft could be sabotaged by replacing normal rivets with soft lead or wooden ones which would fail during flight. The impressor operates when the tip is pressed against the material in question. The hardness of the material determines how far the tip indents and this is transferred by a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and lever to be read on a dial.|$|E

50|$|Goldmann {{tonometry}} {{is considered}} to be the gold standard IOP test and is the most widely accepted method. A special disinfected prism is mounted on the tonometer head and then placed against the cornea. The examiner then uses a cobalt blue filter to view two green semi circles. The force applied to the tonometer head is then adjusted using a dial connected to a variable <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> until the inner edges of the green semicircles in the viewfinder meet. When an area of 3.06 mm has been flattened, the opposing forces of corneal rigidity and the tear film are roughly approximate and cancel each other out allowing the pressure in the eye to be determined from the force applied.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an independent thesis corresponding 15 hp and {{was carried out}} on Högskolan in Halmstad {{during the spring of}} 2014. The thesis is the final course which ends a three-year mechanical engineering program with focus on technical design. The thesis started in an operation which electricians are exposed to every day. The operation in question is cable laying or wiring. The tool they use is called a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and is a long and stiff wire, usually made out of nylon or fiberglass. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is fed through pipes in the walls and brings the desired cables with it on the way back. The problem shows up when the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is drawn back by the electrician. The stiffness in the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> causes it to tangle itself and that causes unnecessary irritation and a waste of time. The problem gave an electrician and a good friend an idea about a product that could solve the problem in an easy and functional way. The idea started as a simple idea {{and with the help of}} several different product development methods from a production-, construction-, and design point of view a special methodology was developed, perfectly customized for the thesis. Potential customer gave the verdicts and helped create the needs and requirements for the product. The product went through a big process with creating different concepts and a lot of time was spent in CATIA for the final creation. One of the great goals of the thesis was to create a functional prototype, something that has been achieved and is now ready to be tested in a real environment. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{clinostat}} for simulating microgravity on {{cell systems}} {{carried in a}} fiber fixedly mounted in a rotatable culture vessel is disclosed. The clinostat is rotated horizontally along its longitudinal axis to simulate microgravity or vertically as a control response. Cells are injected into the fiber and {{the ends of the}} fiber are sealed and secured to spaced end pieces of a fiber holder assembly which consists of the end pieces, a hollow fiber, a culture vessel, and a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> with three alignment pins. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is positioned around the culture vessel with its ends abutting the end pieces for alignment of the spring. After the fiber is secured, the spring is decompressed to maintain tension on the fiber while it is being rotated. This assures that the fiber remains aligned along the axis of rotation. The fiber assembly is placed in the culture vessel and culture medium is added. The culture vessel is then inserted into the rotatable portion of the clinostat and subjected to rotate at selected rpms. The internal diameter of the hollow fiber determines the distance the cells are from the axis of rotation...|$|E
30|$|An {{additional}} mechanical {{mechanism for}} a passive parallelogram-based exoskeleton arm-support is presented. It consists of several levers and joints and an attached extension coil spring. The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On {{the one hand}} it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, {{the value of the}} supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4 -link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60  % higher pre load force of the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and a geometrical offset in the construction.|$|E

40|$|For nickel-containing alloys {{irradiated}} in thermalized neutron fluxes, {{the formation}} and reaction of 59 Ni with thermal neutrons can lead to time-varying changes in displacement damage rate, expressed as displacements per atom per second (dpa. s- 1), gas formation and nuclear heating. Ni-rich alloys are used in PWR and BWR reactors as spacers within fuel assemblies but also as <b>tensioning</b> <b>springs</b> for these same assemblies.

Prediction of the irradiationprocesses that affect the functionality of these CANDU internals, such as irradiation embrittlement and irradiation creep, especially under conditions of extended operation, necessitates a consideration of the effect of the transmutation of Ni.
