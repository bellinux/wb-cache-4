5000|$|<b>Thebacon</b> (INN; {{pronounced}} [...] ), or dihydrocodeinone enol acetate, is a semisynthetic opioid that {{is similar}} to hydrocodone and is most commonly synthesised from thebaine. <b>Thebacon</b> is a derivative of acetyldihydrocodeine, where only the 6-7 double bond is saturated. <b>Thebacon</b> is marketed as its hydrochloride salt under the trade name Acedicon, and as its bitartrate under Diacodin and other trade names. The hydrochloride salt has a free base conversion ratio of 0.846. Other salts used in research and other settings include thebacon's phosphate, hydrobromide, citrate, hydroiodide, and sulphate. The US DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number assigned by the Controlled Substances Act 1970 for <b>thebacon</b> and all of its salts is 9737.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all of its}} {{chemical}} {{relatives in}} this class (codeine-based semi-synthetic narcotic antitussives), <b>thebacon</b> exerts its analgesic effect and {{a large part of}} its antitussive and antiperistaltic action as a prodrug for stronger and/or longer-lasting opioids, primarily hydromorphone, which is formed in the liver by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme pathway as well as acetylmorphone. As a result, the effectiveness of a given dose of <b>thebacon</b> will vary amongst patients, and some food and drugs can affect various parts of the liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination profile, and therefore a variable proportion of the potency of <b>thebacon.</b> <b>Thebacon</b> can be said to be the 3-monoacetylmorphine analog of hydrocodone, and/or the acetylmorphone analog of codeine. It is also a close structural relative of 3,14-diacetyloxymorphone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thebacon</b> is a Schedule I {{controlled}} substance in the United States, never {{having been in}} medical use there.|$|E
50|$|For both {{pain and}} coughing, <b>thebacon</b> {{can be made}} more {{effective}} along with NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and/or antihistamines like tripelennamine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, phenyltoloxamine and chlorpheniramine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thebacon</b> is an opioid agonist {{narcotic}} analgesic of {{the middle}} range and a strong antitussive, primarily used in Europe, although {{it is no longer}} in common use. Currently, dihydrocodeine and nicocodeine are used as second-line codeine replacements. <b>Thebacon</b> was invented in Germany in 1924, four years after the first synthesis of hydrocodone. The other dihydromorphinone used as an antitussive is hydromorphone (Dilaudid cough syrup); the other narcotic antitussives are either more directly related to codeine or not related at all (open chain methadone relatives and thiambutenes).|$|E
50|$|<b>Thebacon</b> is {{generated}} by the esterification product of the enol tautomer of hydrocodone (dihydrocodeineone) with acetic acid. Although modification of thebaine {{is the most common}} way of making <b>thebacon,</b> it is not uncommonly prepared by refluxing hydrocodone with acetic anhydride, generally similar to how diacetylmorphine is produced. It is also a product of the metabolism of hydrocodone by Pseudomonas putida M10, the bacterium used for oil spill remediation. This also produces a morphinone reductase which can turn morphine into hydromorphone in a process which produces other active opioids, such as oxymorphone, oxymorphol, or hydromorphinol as intermediates.|$|E
50|$|Acetyldihydrocodeine is an opiate {{derivative}} {{discovered in}} Germany in 1914 {{and was used}} as a cough suppressant and analgesic. It is not commonly used, but has activity similar to other opiates. Acetyldihydrocodeine is a very close relative derivative of <b>Thebacon,</b> where only the 6-7 double bond is unsaturated. Acetyldihydrocodeine can be described as the 6-acetyl derivative of dihydrocodeine and is metabolised in the liver by demethylation and deacetylation to produce dihydromorphine.|$|E
50|$|As an analgesic, codeine compares {{moderately}} {{to other}} opiates. Related to codeine {{in other ways}} are codoxime, <b>thebacon,</b> codeine-N-oxide (genocodeine), related to the nitrogen morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and heterocodeine, which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz. moving the methyl group from the 3 to the 6 position on the morphine carbon skeleton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thebacon</b> is {{indicated}} for moderate to moderately severe pain and dry painful coughing, like hydrocodone. It has a duration {{of action in}} the range of 5 to 9 hours and doses typically start at 5 mg q6h. The drug is most commonly taken orally as an elixir, tablet, or capsule, although rectal and subcutaneous administration has the same advantages with hydrocodone as would taking a tablet or powder or a liquid concentrate buccally or sublingually.|$|E
