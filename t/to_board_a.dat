5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, particularly with Blackmore.

5|$|Macdonald's {{reputation}} as the premier who led the province out of the Great Depression rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification. He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career. Two projects that he pushed especially hard for, the Canso Causeway linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a suspension bridge spanning Halifax Harbour were completed after his death. The bridge, named in his honour, {{made it possible to}} travel between Halifax and Dartmouth without having <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> ferry or drive several kilometres around the Bedford Basin.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 1914, Bradley {{announced}} his intent {{to retire from}} politics upon the completion of his term, owing to the decline of his general health. Hurrying <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> streetcar following his announcement, Bradley suffered a serious fall, sustaining two broken fingers, head trauma, and internal injuries. After briefly attempting {{to return to his}} duties, he became bedfast, and died on May 23, 1914. His official cause of death was listed as uraemia. Upon Bradley's death, both houses of Congress passed resolutions expressing their sympathy, and promptly adjourned out of respect. His body was returned to Frankfort for burial, but in accordance with the wishes of Bradley and his family, did not lie in state. He was buried in the state cemetery in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

Kristel arranged for Israel Halperin, the brother-in-law {{of a friend of}} hers, Wendell Furry, to bring Fuchs some magazines. Max Born lobbied for his release.

After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, in Monte Carlo, Bond follows Xenia Onatopp, {{a member}} of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a {{suspicious}} relationship with Charles Farrel, a Canadian Navy admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with her thighs during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, Siberia, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet electromagnetic weapon satellites from the Cold War. They program the first GoldenEye (Petya) to destroy the complex, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in Saint Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus.|$|E
5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, {{was taking}} her daughters to the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E

5|$|The two armies clashed at Pegae in {{the fifth}} week of the Great Lent, between 11 and 18 March 921. The Byzantine commanders formed their battle lines in the {{lowlands}} near the springs, while the Bulgarians occupied the higher ground. The Bulgarians charged with dreadful battle cry. Their initial blow was irresistible and the Byzantine lines broke. John the Rhaiktor immediately fled and a certain Photinus, son of Platipodos, was killed along with many others while trying to protect him. John the Rhaiktor barely escaped aboard of a dromon. Alexios Mosele, who fled in full armour, drowned with his protomandator while attempting <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> ship. The brothers Pothos and Leo Argyros managed to find shelter in a nearby fortress. In the subsequent rout most of the Byzantine soldiers {{were killed by the}} sword, drowned or were captured by the Bulgarians.

Haddock is dejected by Calculus' abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper's car at a port, he and Tintin race there, believing that the abductors seek <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>a</b> boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and {{that he was one of}} the last descendants of the Inca, with Tintin surmising that Chiquito must be one of Calculus' captors.|$|E
