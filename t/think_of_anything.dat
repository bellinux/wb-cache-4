5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained {{with him for the}} rest of his time with the coastal forces.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

6000|$|I {{might have}} retorted, [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the expense before he <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else. How like a Scotchman!" [...] As it was, I was too anxious to be witty. I only drummed impatiently {{with my fingers}} on the table, and said, [...] "Tell me! tell me!" ...|$|R
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> for that particular part. It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{attempt at}} children's comedies met {{additional}} criticism. Surf Ninjas (1993) and Mr. Magoo (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in Surf Ninjas was only [...] "an extended cameo" [...] and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers [...] "avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen {{outside of the}} Naked Gun series." [...] Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo, a live action remake of the 1950s cartoon, by saying, [...] "I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> to say other than to make the film again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did, {{or rather}} as if I didn't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> it myself,--and that no doubt {{is why the}} {{audience}} didn't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> it either." ...|$|R

500|$|In June 2006, the House Appropriations Committee {{passed a}} $3million earmark to {{establish}} the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York. [...] By 2007 the amount {{had been reduced to}} $2million, but the funding for the Center, whose purpose was to bring more poor and minority students into politics, was the target of criticism from Representative John B. T. Campbell III of California and other Republicans as an abuse of the earmark process and as Rangel's [...] "Monument to Me". [...] City College said it was proud to house the center and Rangel said [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> I am more proud of." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Love Club" [...] is a electropop song. It {{addresses}} the befriending of [...] "a bad crowd." [...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience I had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but our friends and our situation. Then I started to maybe realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you’re all in love".|$|E
500|$|With Elaine's {{birthday}} {{coming up}} Jerry {{has to decide}} on what to get her. Since {{they are not in}} a relationship but they are still having sex he feels that the symbolism of the gift needs to be carefully thought out. He looks for a gift with George but is unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> though he vaguely remembers her saying [...] "something about a bench". Elaine is unhappy with the eventual gift: $182 cash. When Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) gives Elaine the bench she was looking for, for which she is much more grateful, she and Jerry talk over their agreement. They decide to start dating. When Kramer sees them again and asks what they are up to, Jerry notes that they now do [...] "this, that and the other," [...] "the other" [...] being their romantic relationship as a couple.|$|E

60|$|Grandfather Frog {{sat on his}} {{big green}} lily-pad in the Smiling Pool {{and shook his head}} reprovingly at Peter Rabbit. Peter is such a happy-go-lucky little fellow that he never <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but the good time he can have in the present. He never looks ahead to the future. So of course Peter seldom worries. If the sun shines to-day, Peter takes it for granted that it will shine to-morrow; so he hops and skips and has a good time and just trusts to luck.|$|R
60|$|I'm sure I {{ought to}} roll myself in nettles, burdocks, and blackthorn, for here in London I can't really <b>think</b> now <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but flirting, and I'm only much {{the worse for}} it afterwards.|$|R
500|$|Likewise, Beatty said {{he enjoyed}} the actual filming of the episodes but hated the {{television}} business end of it, claiming, [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> I would less rather do than television at this moment." [...] He said the process left him [...] "pretty much burnt" [...] and said his enthusiasm for the show had [...] "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second Homicide season at all because he had accepted a starring role in The Boys, a CBS comedy series also featuring Christopher Meloni. Polito {{said he did not}} believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: [...] "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character." [...] Beatty ended up appearing in both shows, and The Boys was canceled after six episodes.|$|E
500|$|She then {{created the}} role of the Witch in Sondheim-Lapine's Into the Woods (1987). Peters is [...] "considered {{by many to be the}} premier {{interpreter}} of [...] work," [...] according to writer Alex Witchel. Raymond Knapp wrote that Peters [...] "achieved her definitive stardom" [...] in Sunday in the Park With George and Into the Woods. Sondheim has said of Peters, [...] "Like very few others, she sings and acts at the same time," [...] he says. [...] "Most performers act and then sing, act and then sing ... Bernadette is flawless as far as I'm concerned. I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> negative." [...] Peters continued her association with Sondheim by appearing in a 1995 benefit concert of Anyone Can Whistle, playing {{the role of}} Fay Apple. Additionally, she appeared in several concerts featuring Sondheim's work, and performed for him at his 1993 Kennedy Center Honors ceremony.|$|E
500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> that I could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E
60|$|The King, who {{was very}} brave, assured the Queen that he would soon punish the conspirators.

60|$|All the {{servants}} appeared but poor Whittington, who, having neither money nor goods, could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sending <b>anything</b> {{to try his}} luck; but his good friend Miss Alice, thinking his poverty kept him away, ordered him to be called.|$|R
500|$|The Passion of Christ {{became a}} central concern {{during the early}} {{development}} of Bacon's work, and {{he returned to the}} subject throughout his career. When asked by critic Jean Clair why his Crucifixion scenes tended to comprise mainly [...] "slaughter, butchery, mutilated meat and flesh", Bacon replied, [...] "that's all the Crucifixion was, isn't it?... Actually, you can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> more barbaric than the Crucifixion, and that particular way of killing somebody." [...] While Three Studies may have begun as an attempt to directly represent the Crucifixion scene, his explorations led him towards [...] "something completely different". Bacon came to regard the scene as an armature for exploring new ways of representing human behaviours and emotions. For him it amounted to a kind of self-portraiture; a vehicle for working on [...] "all sorts of very private feelings about behaviour and about the way life is".|$|E
500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b> And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, {{but he is still}} the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from moment to moment, and to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E

50|$|However, {{this soon}} backfires when {{worldwide}} obesity rates rise, {{every piece of}} uninhabited land {{in the world is}} developed on, and several countries declare war on each other for no reason at all. Disillusioned, Neil goes to Hammersmith Bridge with the intention of committing suicide, but as he jumps into the River Thames, Dennis jumps in after him and Neil is forced to swim them both out of the river. Sitting on a bench on Hampstead Heath overlooking London, Dennis says that Neil should give the power to him, as he never <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> selfish and he loves taking orders, which Neil happily does.|$|R

500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the party}} {{planning}} continues to go poorly. Dwight publicly and loudly confronts Kelly about {{her time in}} juvenile hall, {{which turns out to}} be for stealing the boat of an ex-boyfriend when she was 14. Kelly also declares she hates the cake Jim picked for her, which is completely blank; he later decorates it and spells her name incorrectly as [...] "Kelley". When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b> They finally settle on offering her one hour of napping or one hour of watching television. She loves the idea and chooses the nap. Meanwhile, Angela appears much happier than usual because she bought a new $7,000 cat with the money she received from selling Andy's engagement ring. She has also set up a nanny cam so she can monitor the cats from work. However, she is horrified to see one of her other cats having sex with the new cat, and rushes home to stop it. Later, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar (Oscar Nunez) watch Angela arrive home on the nanny cam screen, and become disgusted when Angela starts licking the cat to help clean it. Angela eventually returns to work and coughs up a hairball. Oscar claims the image will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|The title Survival was {{arrived at}} almost by default. In his book The World of Survival (Andre Deutsch, 1978), Willock {{revealed}} {{it was nearly}} called Tooth and Claw.
