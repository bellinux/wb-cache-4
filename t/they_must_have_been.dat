5|$|Roger of Hoveden {{described}} Uhtred of Galloway as a consanguinus ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, {{an assertion}} {{that has given}} rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of Henry I; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not. According to historian G.W.S. Barrow, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of King John of England, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.|$|E
5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E

25|$|Neither Pliny's nor Ptolemy's {{lists of}} Scandinavian tribes include the Suiones {{mentioned}} by Tacitus.

25|$|The {{argument}} from irreducible complexity is {{a descendant of}} the teleological argument for God (the {{argument from}} design or from complexity). This states that because certain things in nature appear very complicated, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> designed. William Paley famously argued, in his 1802 watchmaker analogy, that complexity in nature implies a God {{for the same reason}} that the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker. This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as Cicero's De Natura Deorum ii.34, written in 45 BC.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to receiving compensation, farmers whose land {{was used to}} build the structures were paid after the war to fill in ditches and trenches and to demolish pillboxes. Today, hardly anything remains of the anti-tank ditches, {{but at the time}} <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the most conspicuous of all the fortifications. A few remain, much humbled, as field drains or field boundaries, whereas others can be seen only as crop marks. In the case of pillboxes, the sum of £5 is sometimes mentioned to pay for demolition, but the challenge of demolishing such structures is considerable and it seems that most farmers pocketed the cash, treating it as compensation.|$|E

The two pairs of slabs that form the north part of the frieze share the same general figural pattern. A male and female pair, divine or mortal, dominate the left slab. On the right slab, a female and centaur are placed at left and a centaur and hoplite at right. This repetition highlights the contrasting movements in each pair away from the central axis.|$|E
25|$|They {{have been}} {{definitively}} {{attributed to the}} Kadambas because they not only have various Kadamba symbols, such as conches and chakras, {{but one of the}} epithets on the coins, sri dosharashi, is known from inscriptions to have been used by the Kadamba king Krishnavarma II (ruled 516–540). Other coins with the legend sri manarashi were also found, along with anepigraphic coins (that is, coins without any legends) featuring flowers, chakras, and conches. The lotus, chakra (discus), and conch are all symbols of the god Vishnu. Kadamba inscriptions frequently invoke Vishnu, indicating <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> devotees of this deity. The identity of the king named sri manarashi has still not been determined.|$|E

25|$|A growing {{differentiation}} {{in terms}} of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This {{is illustrated by the}} discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear that a young child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. There is probably also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and Aussensiedlung were not able to locally produce enough food to support their own populations implied quite clearly that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{evolution}} of the Sun made it progressively more luminous during the Archean and Proterozoic eons; the Sun's luminosity increases 6% every billion years. As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon. However, the Earth did not get warmer. Instead, the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early Proterozoic. Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> located near the equator. Thus, this glaciation, known as the Huronian glaciation, may have been global. Some scientists suggest this was so severe that the Earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator, a hypothesis called Snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} consequences of guilds {{have led to}} heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership {{at the expense of}} the entire economy.|$|E

25|$|A Waterloo and Whitehall Railway was {{promoted}} in 1864, {{to construct a}} tube railway from Great Scotland Yard to Waterloo. It was to use air pressure to propel the vehicles northwards, and was to exhaust air to draw them southwards, using a pressure differential of 2½ oz per sq in (about 11 mbar). The trains themselves would be the pistons. The company capital was to be £100,000. It was suggested {{that there could be}} a branch to where the Embankment station is now located: it is not clear how a junction would be managed in a pneumatic railway. There were to be three vehicles, one loading at each terminal and one in motion in the tube, so <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended to pass at the terminals. There were to be three classes of accommodation in the coaches.|$|E
25|$|During the 1st century AD, two stones (an {{altar and}} an inscription) attest that the Cohors Primae Fida Vardulorum Milliaria Equitata Civium Romanorum (The First Cohort of Faithful Varduli, one-thousand strong, part-mounted, {{citizens}} of Rome) were present at Longovicium. This unit of Varduli had {{its origins in}} Hispania Tarraconensis, Gipuzkoa, in northern Spain, where the unit was raised. This unit was also present at other forts in the Britannia Superior, such as Castlecary, Bremenium (High Rochester), Corstopitum (Corbridge) and milecastle 19 on Hadrian's Wall. The Tarraconensis region of Spain {{was the most important}} source of gold, tin, copper and other metals and minerals in the entire Roman Empire, and the Romans applied water power on a large scale for hydraulic mining using aqueducts to tap the local rivers. The remains of their mining efforts can be seen today at Las Médulas, for example. It may not be coincidental that Lanchester possesses so many aqueducts and reservoirs, although <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adapted for some other purpose.|$|E
25|$|Gyula László, a Hungarian archaeologist, {{suggests}} that late Avars, arriving to the qaganate in A.D 670 in great numbers, {{lived through the}} time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791–795 {{and the arrival of}} the Magyars in 895. László points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) did not replace but complement those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pastoring. He also notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40–50 graves on average, the Avars contain 600–1000. According to these findings the Avars not just survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of Árpád. He also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian-basin, but Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, one only finds Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language, rather Finno-Ugric, and so <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> assimilated by the Avars that outnumbered them and the genetics of today's modern Hungarians is no different than that of neighboring West Slavs as well as western Ukrainians. László's Avar-Hungarian continuity theory also states that Hungarians speak Avar, though this has been disproved as Hungarian belongs to the Finnic-Ugric branch of languages.|$|E

40|$|The general {{synthetic}} strategy towards water-soluble biodegradable drug {{carriers and}} the properties that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The syntheses of water-soluble biodegradable copolymers of lysine and aspartic acid as potential drug-delivering devices, having amine-functionalised side chains are then described. Covalent anchoring of carboxylic acid derivatives of the antineoplastic ferrocene and photodynamically active phthalocyanine moieties to the amine-containing drug carrier copolymers under mild coupling conditions <b>has</b> <b>been</b> achieved utilising the coupling reagent O-benzotriazolyl-N,N,N ′,N ′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate to promote {{formation of the}} biodegradable amide bond.
