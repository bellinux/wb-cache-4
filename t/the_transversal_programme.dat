The project investigates game creation as an innovative educational framework and addresses the development of the above mentioned abilities/attitudes by adopting a collaborative, "learning by doing" approach to digital game construction (game building in groups), which is actually quite new in the field. The outcomes of the project, which is still on-going, will hopefully trace new avenues for engaging students in both highly motivating and effective game- based educational activities. In a wider perspective, the working methodology adopted in this project could also be fruitfully re-used to inform further different educational initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Intercomprehension (IC) – at its simplest: {{a form of}} {{communication}} in which each person uses {{his or her own}} language and is also able to understand that of the other(s) – is a concept that originates in contrastive linguistics and constitutes a research field with a view to implementing within the Languages – Culture Didactics. It has been at the core of several research projects since the ’ 90 s, and as of 2011 the team of researchers within Intermar (a European Cooperation Project funded by the EU Commission’s Lifelong Learning Programme, under Key Action 2 of <b>the</b> <b>Transversal</b> <b>Programme,</b> coordinated by Prof. F. Capucho at Universidade catolica in Viseu, Portugal) has been trying to encourage IC practice within the maritime community by offering a blended 60 -hour course of uniquely designed modules containing learning materials and collaborative tasks. The course was piloted in 8 Naval and Maritime Academies involved in the project (among which the Naval Academy of Constanta) during the academic year of 2012 – 2013.

5000|$|In mathematics, given a {{collection}} C of sets, a transversal (also called a cross-section) {{is a set}} containing exactly one element from {{each member of the}} collection. When the sets of the collection are mutually disjoint, each element of <b>the</b> <b>transversal</b> corresponds to exactly one member of C (the set it is a member of). If the original sets are not disjoint, there are two possibilities for the definition of a <b>transversal.</b> One variation, <b>the</b> one that mimics the situation when the sets are mutually disjoint, {{is that there is a}} bijection f from <b>the</b> <b>transversal</b> to C such that x is an element of f(x) for each x in <b>the</b> <b>transversal.</b> In this case, <b>the</b> <b>transversal</b> is also called a system of distinct representatives. The other, less commonly used, possibility does not require a one-to-one relation between the elements of <b>the</b> <b>transversal</b> and <b>the</b> sets of C.
