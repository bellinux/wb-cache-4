5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating.</b> Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The tips of the jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It {{is more likely that}} they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E

25|$|Five {{independent}} {{witnesses were}} called to testify {{on behalf of the}} defense as to Collins' whereabouts on the dates Karen Sue Beineman had disappeared and her body had been found. Four of these witnesses were employees of a motorcycle sales firm which Collins had visited on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance. Each testified on August 6. The timing of these four witnesses' recollections as to when Collins had actually entered the motorcycle shop varied slightly, although consensus among three of these men was that he had entered the premises as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> lunch, which they typically did anytime between one and two p.m. Upon cross-examination, the time factor of these witnesses as to when they had actually seen Collins expanded to between noon and two p.m. Two of these employees had signed statements affirming the time Collins had entered their premises was approximately two p.m., although one of these witnesses stated he had been repeatedly harassed by an Ann Arbor Police Sergeant as to the actual time he had seen Collins.|$|E

25|$|Judith finally convinces Godolphin {{to bring}} her to Yzordderrex {{with the threat of}} leaving him. They head to the retreat where they {{originally}} met, but as Godolphin starts their transference to the second dominion, Dowd comes and interferes and ends up going through to Yzordderrex with Judith instead of Godolphin. They arrive in the house of Peccable, a merchant friend of Godolphin's. Arriving in Yzordderrex, Gentle, Pie and Huzzah encounter an entourage containing the Autarch's Queen, Quaisoir, and Gentle is shocked to find out that her appearance is identical to that of Judith's. With the rebellions in Yzordderrex getting out of control, she flees and Gentle becomes convinced that he has to head to the palace to find out if it's really her. Judith meanwhile has another out of body experience where she witnesses Quaisoir after a fight with the Autarch, who is upset with her becoming enamored with religion, and Father Athanasius, the leader of the 'Dearther' group of rebels (and the man who wed Gentle and Pie at the Cradle). Gentle, Pie and Huzzah arrive at the Eurhetemec Kesperate(district) that Pie is from and find it mostly deserted except for four people, who have a hard time believing that they're not the enemy. Pie tells Gentle and Huzzah to meet him later at a cafe <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> at. Although Huzzah and Gentle return there, with the chaos going on they leave and encounter a group that includes a Nullianac that kidnaps Huzzah. Gentle chases after them and eventually defeats the Nullianac, but not before it kills Huzzah.|$|E
500|$|Since 1975, McCartney {{has been}} a vegetarian; {{he and his wife}} Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage. They decided to stop {{consuming}} meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists. In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients. In 1995, he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth, written by Tony Wardle. McCartney is a supporter of the animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009 McCartney narrated a video for them titled [...] "Glass Walls", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare. McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation. As of 2013, McCartney is vegan.|$|E

2500|$|A {{small number}} of people still believe there is {{credence}} to allegations of SRA and continue to discuss the topic. Publications by Cathy O'Brien claiming SRA were the result of government programs (specifically the Central Intelligence Agency's Project MKULTRA) to produce Manchurian candidate-style mind control in young children were picked up by conspiracy theorists, linking belief in SRA with claims of government conspiracies. In the book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), authors Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson cite ongoing belief in the SRA phenomenon despite a complete lack of evidence as demonstration of the confirmation bias in believers; it further points out that a lack of evidence is actually considered by believers in SRA as more evidence, demonstrating [...] "how clever and evil the cult leaders were: <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> those babies, bones and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} eating habits on {{childhood}} obesity {{are difficult to}} determine. [...] A three-year randomized controlled study of 1,704 3rd grade children which provided two healthy meals a day in combination with an exercise program and dietary counsellings failed to show {{a significant reduction in}} percentage body fat when compared to a control group. [...] This was partly {{due to the fact that}} even though the children believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> less their actual calorie consumption did not decrease with the intervention. [...] At the same time observed energy expenditure remained similar between the groups. [...] This occurred even though dietary fat intake decreased from 34% to 27%. [...] A second study of 5,106 children showed similar results. [...] Even though the children ate an improved diet there was no effect found on BMI. [...] Why these studies did not bring about the desired effect of curbing childhood obesity has been attributed to the interventions not being sufficient enough. [...] Changes were made primarily in the school environment while it is felt that they must occur in the home, the community, and the school simultaneously to have a significant effect.|$|E
