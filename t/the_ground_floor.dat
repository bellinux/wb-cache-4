5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> {{was the great}} hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> raised to first floor level and the basement becoming <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor.</b> Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|From 1789 until 1792, {{when the}} French royal court {{resided in the}} Tuileries, the {{apartment}} of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> of the Pavillon de Flore housed {{the office of the}} princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with the}} apartment of queen Marie Antoinette in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> of the main building of the Tuileries, while the first floor of the Pavillon housed the apartment of Madame Elisabeth.|$|E
40|$|On coastal dikes in Belgium, many {{residential}} buildings are found. Most {{of the old}} buildings are masonry structures with two to three <b>floors</b> (Figure 1). <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are always elevated (Figure 2), and the entrances of the basements are closed by shutters (Figure 3). The most modern buildings are concrete reinforcement structures with concrete piles/columns as foundations. The walls are consisting of masonry or concrete. These buildings are 5 to 9 floors high. Some of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are elevated, and some are used as cafe, restaurant or store. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are equipped with large glass windows and doors. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
