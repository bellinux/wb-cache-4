5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E
25|$|The LCMS {{believes}} that the Holy Scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the Law and the Gospel. The Law is all those demands in the Bible which must be obeyed {{in order to gain}} salvation. However, because all people are sinners, it is impossible for people to completely obey the Law. Therefore, the Law implies an inevitable consequence of God's wrath, judgment, and damnation. The Gospel, on the other hand, is the promise of free salvation from God to sinners. The Law condemns; the Gospel saves. Both the Law and the Gospel are gifts from God; both are necessary. The function of the law is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> their sinful nature and drive them to the Gospel, in which the forgiveness of sin is promised {{for the sake of the}} death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.|$|E

500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven DeKnight, {{who wrote}} for Marsters {{when he was}} portraying Spike on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, used a {{different}} approach for Marsters when writing for him as Brainiac. Spike is more [...] "snarky", and DeKnight felt Fine is more sincere, and a [...] "straight-ahead classic villain". This different approach to villainy worked well for Marsters, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> he could portray characters who were not just another [...] "Spike". Marsters describes Brainiac as [...] "a murderous robot" [...] with no remorse over his actions. According to Marsters, the character is an [...] "intellectual" [...] who is focused on what he wants. The actor {{was drawn to the}} series because of the [...] "refreshing" [...] take the producers had, as well as an appreciation for the idea of a show about Clark's journey toward becoming Superman.|$|E

After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid: [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> {{that if you have a}} dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," [...] Fleury said of the show.

A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point."

500|$|In {{a review}} of the episode, TV Squad commented {{positively}} about the storyline, noting that [...] "Unlike The Simpsons tonight, Family Guy actually did work their two storylines together.

[...] In {{a review of}} Family Guy, Volume 4, Nancy Basile regards [...] "The Fat Guy Strangler" [...] as one of her favorite episodes, as well as [...] "PTV." [...] Basile moves on to comment that [...] "Being prejudiced against fat people just isn't talked about, but this episode sheds a harsh light on that problem.

500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> that I do what I say", he said. [...] "Now they can judge me in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, Peace on Earth {{was written}} {{based on the}} {{question}} [...] "How do you know there's peace on earth {{in a world that}} isn't very peaceful?" [...] Hall opined that when people hear Christmas carols, they often don't hear their true message. Hall intended the album to help people rediscover the worshipful nature behind the carols. As an example of a message he wanted people to hear, he gave [...] "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day", a song written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow about his rediscovery of hope amidst several personal tragedies. Hall felt that the song's message of hope was one that his kids and their generation needed to hear. As a co-producer on the album, Hall wanted to introduce aspects and ideas that the band had not done before, and he felt the album offered a chance to branch out. He wanted the band's female members, Megan Garrett and Melodee DeVevo, to play a more prominent role, in part <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> [...] "the gifts they have".|$|E
500|$|According to the series' {{director}} Gorō Taniguchi, {{the idea}} for s-CRY-ed originated in 1999 {{when he was working}} on the series Infinite Ryvius. One of Infinite Ryviuss themes was people communicating with each other. The series' staff wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> already on their own paths, focusing more on individualism. With the storyline beginning in the early 21st century, Taniguchi said the cast would already have adapted to the new times allowing s-CRY-ed to take more themes from Infinite Ryvius. The title s-CRY-ed is basically a combination of one English word and Japanese. The first lower-case [...] "s" [...] is a representation of the Japanese word su which means something in its natural form and not artificial. [...] "Cry" [...] comes from the English, and the last [...] "ed" [...] represents a person. Combined as [...] "s-CRY-ed" [...] the Sunrise studio staff wanted it to express the idea of how people react or interact when they are in their most natural state. They had devised the word when the project was in its early phases of production, and while {{it was meant to be}} a temporary name, the staff ended up using it as the title.|$|E

500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we pulled it off and were able <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Petr Harmáček (known online by the alias [...] "Harmy") {{had watched}} a dubbed {{version of the}} {{original}} cut of Star Wars {{at the age of}} six, and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release. Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was [...] "an act of cultural vandalism". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that [...] "undid" [...] the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: [...] "I wanted to be able <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like my little brother or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't want to have to show it to them in bad quality." [...] Harmáček's edits were the first to recreate the theatrical releases in HD.|$|E

500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... {{there are moments when}} he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E
500|$|Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, {{the stars}} and creators of the American sketch comedy {{television}} series Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, guest starred in the episode as foodies Amus Bruse and Fois Garth, respectively. These two characters are among the foodies that Marge, Bart, and Lisa meet at the Ethiopian restaurant. In the episode, they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is [...] "all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie." [...] It was co-written by the duo, and {{was inspired by the}} song [...] "Empire State of Mind". [...] Selman has commented that [...] "In animated TV shows, whenever you're trying <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> having fun doing their new thing , it just kind of becomes a boring montage. And we've done so many montages on The Simpsons over 25 years, it's like, oh, God, no more montages. [...] So we were like, 'Why not do a silly rap song?' Rapping is sort of inherently boastful, and there's something about being a foodie that's inherently boastful. It's like the boastfulness links those things. So Tim and Eric perform a food rap song in the show—an extremely silly rap song, and the name is intentionally silly: 'Blogging a Food Blog.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Robert C. Cooper {{intended}} the episode as [...] "an emotional {{tribute to the}} ten seasons that [...] come before" [...] and [...] "the last chapter in the book – but not necessarily in the series of books. It was a chance , using science fiction, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>people</b> one version of what the future might be like for these characters that they've {{spent so much time}} with and loved so much." [...] By killing off the Asgard race, Cooper gave the episode an element of tragedy that reflected his feelings at the time. Producer Brad Wright wanted all of the characters to get a last shot in the spotlight instead of focusing on only one character. Because of fan vocality about team episodes, Cooper decided to put the characters through several decades of life and see their relationships develop and evolve. The references in [...] "Unending" [...] to the events of season 2's [...] "The Fifth Race", another Cooper-penned episode often named as a fan favorite, were intended, as were the callbacks to season 9's [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] (the Daniel-Vala argument, see below) and season 10's [...] "Line In The Sand" [...] (the solution of using the Ori beam). The period aboard the ship was originally significantly less than fifty years, but the actors' last-stage makeup, which Cooper only saw minutes before filming, looked so old that Cooper was forced {{to increase the number of}} years in the script.|$|E
