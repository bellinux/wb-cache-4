No one in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would sound like that, and no one would cheer for someone singing like that." [...] The following day, Beyoncé spoke about the allegations to MTV News. She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances. In an interview with Chris Harris of Rolling Stone, Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Beyoncé's reaction to it. He admitted that he had previously given the same treatment to Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and that he did not feel he had to apologize for the hoax: ...|$|E

We were told that they were always thus torn and forlorn in their appearance at first, but that they gradually took pains to make themselves respectable.

[...] "Cannibal Islands" [...] some of them still are, without doubt, but {{a large proportion of}} them have been saved from heathen darkness by the light of God's Truth as revealed in the Holy Bible, and many thousands of islanders--including the descendants of those who slew the great Captain of the last generation--have enrolled themselves under the banner of the [...] "Captain of our salvation," [...] and are now, through God's mercy, clothed and in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

It also mentions that no one wanted to, because the boghogs communicate by biting each other very hard on the thigh.|$|R
6000|$|The {{only reason}} why dog fights {{do not go}} on for ever is that Providence has decided that on each such {{occasion}} there shall always be among those present one Master Mind; one wizard who, whatever his shortcomings in other battles of life, is in this single particular sphere competent and dominating. At Roville-sur-Mer it was the red-haired young man. His dark companion might have turned from him in disgust: his services might not have seemed worth retaining by the haughty Scrymgeour: {{he might be a}} pain in the neck to [...] "the family"; but he did know how to stop a dog fight. From the first moment of his intervention calm began to steal over the scene. He had the same effect on the almost inextricably entwined belligerents as, in mediaeval legend, the Holy Grail, sliding down the sunbeam, used to have on battling knights. He did not look like a dove of peace, but the most captious could not have denied that he brought home the goods. There was a magic in his soothing hands, a spell in his voice: and in a shorter time than one would have believed possible dog after dog had been sorted out and calmed down; until presently all that was left of Armageddon was one solitary small Scotch terrier, thoughtfully licking a chewed leg. The rest of the combatants, once more in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> and wondering what all the fuss was about, had been captured and haled away in a whirl of recrimination by voluble owners.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} he came round to the garden door again he found a group there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the {{sunlight}} had already rolled away the mists. It {{was in no way}} rationally reassuring; it was simply broadly comic, like a cluster of Dickens's characters. Major Putnam had managed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and trousers, with a crimson cummerbund, and a light square jacket over all; thus normally set off, his red festive face seemed bursting with a commonplace cordiality. He was indeed emphatic, but then he was talking to his cook--the swarthy son of Malta, whose lean, yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow-white cap and costume. The cook might well be careworn, for cookery was the Major's hobby. He was one of those amateurs who always know more than the professional. The only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette was his friend Cray--and as Brown remembered this, he turned to look for the other officer. In the new presence of daylight and people clothed and in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> the sight of him was rather a shock. The taller and more elegant man was still in his night-garb, with tousled black hair, and now crawling about the garden on his hands and knees, still looking for traces of the burglar; and now and again, to all appearance, striking the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him. Seeing him thus quadrupedal in the grass, the priest raised his eyebrows rather sadly; {{and for the first time}} guessed that [...] "fancies things" [...] might be an euphemism.|$|E

60|$|And here a {{few words}} must be said to persons with whose {{difficulties}} I deeply sympathise, but from whose conclusions I differ utterly: those, namely, who say that if we reject the miracles of these saints' lives, we must reject also the miracles of the New Testament. The answer is, as I believe, that the Apostles and Evangelists were sane men: men in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds,</b> wise, calm; conducting themselves (save {{in the matter of}} committing sins) like other human beings, as befitted the disciples of that Son of Man who came eating and drinking, and was therefore called by the ascetics of his time a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber: whereas these monks were not (as I have said elsewhere) in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds</b> at all.|$|R

Those who accumulate goods beyond their basic needs are regarded with suspicion and often loathing. But what are basic needs?

Unfortunately, the aristocrats of the Pushkin circle viewed him as a vulgar parvenu, and his attack on Karamzin's reactionary History of the Russian State offended many influential people, notably Pyotr Vyazemsky, who had been Karamzin's ward and whose sister was married to the older historian. When Polevoy wrote his own six-volume History of the Russian People (1829-1833), it was savaged by almost everyone. The brilliant and idiosyncratic critic Apollon Grigoryev wrote in his memoirs, [...] "From our present 1864 point of view {{it would be impossible}} to conceive anything more indecent than the article that the editor of the Moscow Herald Mikhail Pogodin hurled against The History of the Russian People, if the articles Nikolai Nadezhdin against it in the old men's European Herald had not been even more indecent... The factions do not seem to have been in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds</b> thirty years ago. What was the cause of their being so hostile that they foamed at the mouth?"

The attempt to kindle the torch of religious fear or hate was in Great Britain happily a failure. The mass of liberal presbyterians in Scotland, and of nonconformists in England and Wales, stood firm, though some of their most eminent and able divines resisted the new project, less on religious grounds than on what they took to be the balance of political arguments.
