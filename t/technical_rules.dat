5|$|In 1993, Norway {{decided to}} allow any airline from the European Economic Area to operate {{helicopter}} services in Norway from 1995. This meant that companies like Bristow Group, KLM and Maersk Air could start operation in Norway. This would be coordinated through common <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> for helicopters through the Joint Aviation Authorities. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid NOK225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated {{they would have to}} look at the merger, since the new company would have a near-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK170 million profit on the five-year venture. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi needed the capital to participate in an initial public offering of Braathens. Most of the management of Braathens Helikopter was hired at the newly established competitor United Helicopter, a joint venture between Bristow Helicopters, Leif Höegh & Co and Andreas Ugland & Sønn.|$|E

The empirical {{results show that the}} trading rules have stronger predictive power in the emerging stock markets than in the developed stock markets. In addition, the short-term variants of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules</b> may be more useful in detecting the predictive ability of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules.</b> In examining the profitability of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules,</b> the study shows that transaction costs can eliminate the trading profits for most stock markets. The empirical results show that the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules</b> are profitable in Thailand, Shenzhen, and Korea stock markets after adjusting for transaction costs. There is no evidence of the profitability of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules</b> in other stock markets after transaction costs. In order to investigate the relationship between market efficiency and the profitability of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules,</b> the study compares the excess returns between six developed stock markets and six emerging stock markets during the test period. The empirical results show that the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules</b> performed better in the emerging stock markets than in the developed stock markets.

This paper tests whether the most popular <b>technical</b> <b>rule</b> – the moving average – generates profits in the Madrid Stock Exchange by utilizing genetic algorithms to optimise the rule in the in-sample period (May 1990 - May 1995) and applying it to the out-sample period (May 1995 – May 1996) over 25 stocks and indexes.

The <b>technical</b> trading <b>rule</b> is also compared to the buy-and-hold strategy to determine which strategy is more profitable. The study is carried out on the NSE 20 Index using the Excel software. A three-layered feedforward network model is used following (Rodriguez, Martel, & Rivero, 2000). The data set is divided into three sub-periods corresponding to the bear, stable and bull markets. Nine stock indices are then sampled from each sub-period and used as the inputs to the model so as to obtain the ANN forecasts. To determine the forecast accuracy, both the percentage of correct predictions and the Pesaran and Timmermann (1992) non-parametric test proportion of correctly predicted signs are used. To test for economic significance, the total return of the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rule</b> is compared to the buy-and-hold return. The results suggest that, in the absence of trading costs, the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rule</b> is always superior to the buy-and-hold strategy for both bear and stable markets. The buy-and-hold strategy, however, generates higher returns than the <b>technical</b> trading <b>rule</b> for bull markets. These findings are especially beneficial to traders since they can achieve significant trading advantages through the adoption of ANN based <b>technical</b> trading <b>rules.</b> Traders can therefore alternate between the ANN based <b>technical</b> trading <b>rule</b> and the buy-and-hold strategy, depending on whether it is a bear, bull, or stable episode, so as to maximize profits and minimize losse...|$|R

United States, 381 U.S. 214 (1965), was decided {{subsequent}} to Aguilar. It {{is by no means}} inconsistent with Aguilar."The dissent argued that the two pronged test of the honesty of the informant and the basis of knowledge was more protective of a citizen's rights, leaving less chance of a warrant being issued based upon the claims of a dishonest or unreliable [...] "informant." [...] The dissenters believed that the Aguilar–Spinelli test was effective and should not have been replaced; that tests and laws that protect the rights of accused are too easily disregarded because the court and law enforcers are eager to prosecute suspects; and that the rights of the suspects also have to be protected. The dissenters stated,"By replacing Aguilar and Spinelli with a test that provides no assurance that magistrates, rather than the police, or informants, will make determinations of probable cause; imposes no structure on magistrates’ probable-cause inquiries; and invites the possibility that intrusions may be justified on less than reliable information from an honest or credible person, today’s decision threatens to obliterate one of the most fundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state, where they are the law." [...] Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall also argued that the court did not show any persuasive reason for rejecting Aguilar and Spinelli, saying that the Court “reflects impatience with what it perceives to be overly <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> governing searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.” The dissenters supported their opinion by stating that, “Words such as practical, nontechnical, and common sense, as used in the Court’s opinion, are but code words for an overly permissive attitude towards police practices in derogation of the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment.” In other words, taking away suspects' rights is not a correct way to enforce drug laws, even though drug trafficking is reprehensible.

60|$|In {{ancient times}} it has {{happened}} to the law of England (as in pleading, so in matter of evidence) that a rigid strictness in the application of <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> has been more observed than at present it is. In the more early ages, as the minds of the Judges were in general less conversant in the affairs of the world, as the sphere of their jurisdiction was less extensive, and as the matters which came before them were of less variety and complexity, the rule being in general right, not so much inconvenience on the whole was found from a literal adherence to it as might have arisen from an endeavor towards a liberal and equitable departure, for which further experience, and a more continued cultivation of equity as a science, had not then so fully prepared them. In those times that judicial policy was not to be condemned. We find, too, that, probably from the same cause, most of their doctrine leaned towards the restriction; and the old lawyers being bred, according to the then philosophy of the schools, in habits of great subtlety and refinement of distinction, and having once taken that bent, very great acuteness of mind was displayed in maintaining every rule, every maxim, every presumption of law creation, and every fiction of law, with a punctilious exactness: and this seems to have been the course which laws have taken in every nation.[50] It was probably from this rigor, and from a sense of its pressure, that, at an early period of our law, far more causes of criminal jurisdiction were carried into the House of Lords and the Council Board, where laymen were judges, than can or ought to be at present.|$|E
