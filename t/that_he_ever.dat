5|$|On January 21, 2016, Collins {{signed a}} {{contract}} {{to play with the}} Chicago Blues of the Midwest Professional Basketball Association. In March, he signed with the Windsor Express of the National Basketball League of Canada with no indication <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> played for the Blues.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
60|$|His fingers {{shook with}} eagerness. She put a tiny volume into his hands. He shook back the hair {{from his head}} and forgot <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> been ill, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> suffered, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> despaired. For the love of books was in his blood, and his tongue was loosened. For {{the first time in}} his life he knew the full delight of a {{sympathetic}} listener. They entered upon a new relationship in those few minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hopkins {{has taken}} a lot of money out of this town," [...] remarked Patsy, {{examining}} a new kind of tooth wash. [...] "But I can't find <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>ever</b> given much of it back." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the November 7, 1963 {{issue of}} Down Beat magazine, critic Harvey Pekar awarded the album 5 stars {{and said that}} [...] "Golson's improvising is outstanding; I doubt <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>ever</b> before played as {{consistently}} well on record." ...|$|R
5|$|No written {{contemporary}} {{description of}} Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of {{as a good}} likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E
5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot {{was the leading}} candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, {{at least since the}} replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> received much schooling.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, sir," [...] {{continued}} the landlady, detaining him, [...] "you must be careful, for he ain't hisself quite. Not <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>ever</b> done anythink wiolent to me, poor young man, but he's strong in his fits, an' he raves terribly." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was his own}} enemy. I mean, look, a lot {{of people}} that are artists tend to be their own worst enemy because we're passionate people... Most {{recently}} he's been, honestly, in the best frame of mind <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>ever</b> been in, in the past year...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>he</b> well {{deserved}} one, yes. <b>That</b> <b>he</b> would <b>ever</b> have one, no.|$|R
5|$|The Order of the Phoenix {{gather and}} escort Harry to safety, using Polyjuice Potion to create decoy Harrys for the trip. During their flight {{they all are}} ambushed by Death Eaters who kill Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig, injure George Weasley, and knock out Hagrid. After {{arriving}} at the Burrow, Harry has {{a vision of the}} wand-maker Ollivander being tortured by Voldemort. The next day Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledore's will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledore's Deluminator, Hermione receives a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry receives the first Golden Snitch <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> caught in a Quidditch match. Scrimgeour reveals that Harry was also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. The minister tells Harry that the sword was not Dumbledore's to bequeath, and in any case is missing.|$|E
5|$|The rock {{supposedly}} {{found in}} the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed {{that if he had}} found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that {{there was no evidence that}} the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> found it.|$|E
25|$|Coffey also {{dismissed}} the notion <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> received information about Kelli Ryan or her case in advance or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> met with A's Eric Leven. This runs contrary to Leven working alongside Coffey in several episodes and also {{is contrary to}} interviews given by Coffey where he clearly states that he meets with producers to learn and strategize about how to proceed with walkthroughs.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{particularly}} noted for his captaincy, having been praised {{from the likes}} of Shane Warne as the [...] "best captain in world cricket" [...] and most recently, Graeme Swann who said that Fleming is one of the two true leaders <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>ever</b> seen, alongside Andrew Strauss.|$|R
50|$|Not <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was <b>ever</b> {{a colonel}} of anything...He was just coloneliferous.|$|R
60|$|JULIA. <b>That's</b> all <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> takes, Mr. Cuthbertson, I assure you. He {{hates to}} be bothered about it.|$|R
25|$|His {{last years}} were spent in Hamburg, {{one of the}} few refuges {{available}} within Germany from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War. There is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> returned to England.|$|E
25|$|Possibly a {{licensed}} pilot, {{a man with}} his name was registered as having trained at the Spartan Aeronautics School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, although the school denies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> attended, indicating a possible case of mistaken identity.|$|E
25|$|According to CNN, {{his only}} known {{associations}} were as a registered Republican while in Buffalo, New York in the 1980s, and a {{membership in the}} National Rifle Association while in the Army, {{and there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> belonged to any extremist groups.|$|E

25|$|According to David Frith's book The Fast Men, Burns was an {{exceptionally}} quick bowler — Frank Chester, who played against {{him before the}} war, named him the fastest bowler, ahead even of Harold Larwood, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> saw —, but he was handicapped by suspicions that he threw.|$|E
25|$|When {{she died}} in 1853, Douglas, acting as {{executor}} of her estate and guardian of their minor children who inherited the slaves, controlled the plantation and derived most of his income from it. He denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> personally owned these slaves, for they belonged {{to his wife and}} his children.|$|E
25|$|Jones never {{actually}} received the DCM, {{although it was}} widely reported {{at the time that}} he was recommended for it by his commanding officer. Several veterans have since supported the claim that Jones was to be awarded the DCM, but no records have surfaced to prove <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> received it.|$|E

25|$|At the Gathering, Hollyleaf {{reveals the}} secret {{about her and}} her brothers' parents. Crowfeather denies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> has any kits besides Breezepelt, and he states that Leafpool and their kits mean nothing to him. Breezepelt and Nightcloud are both outraged about never being informed. Seeing how {{everyone}} feels she did something wrong, Hollyleaf runs off into the tunnels which collapse.|$|E
25|$|All Saints Church, Bodalla, was {{designed}} to commemorate the life of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, 'father of Australian dairying', and was built between 1880 and 1901 from granite quarried on Mort's estate. While a Blacket design, it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> saw the site or the church which was overseen by his son Cyril. However, it also features hand-wrought iron hinges and straps {{said to have been}} designed by Blacket himself.|$|E
25|$|Nash {{was called}} to the bar on 25 November 1623, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> went on to practice law. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that he may however have taken over a rôle that his father held in being an agent for Sir John Hubaud, a High Sheriff of Warwickshire; but Sir John Hubaud died in 1583, ten years before Thomas was born.|$|E
