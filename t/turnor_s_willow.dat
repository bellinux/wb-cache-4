5000|$|This willow is {{commonly}} dominant in willow communities across its range. Other willows in the habitat may include Bebb <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> bebbiana), grayleaf <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> glauca), Sitka <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> sitchensis), Pacific <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> lasiandra), barren-ground <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> brachycarpa), and halberd <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> hastata). It grows along {{rivers and streams}} and lakes. It grows in forested habitat, {{but it does not}} tolerate shade, so it persists only in open areas. Because it germinates quickly, it easily colonizes disturbed habitat, such as riverbanks scoured by recent floods and areas where glaciers have receded. It grows in early stages of succession, and after a few decades, it is shaded out by poplars and other trees as the habitat turns into forest.This plant is fire-adapted and can resprout after its aboveground parts are burned away. The wind-dispersed seeds then land on the burned soil and colonize the terrain.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Thirteen {{different}} habitat parameters {{were measured}} either quantitatively or qualitatively around seven different Salix (willow) species on a defined reach of stream on the southwestern slope of Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon {{in order to}} both broaden the current information base of riparian ecology and inform future willow plantings aimed at improving riparian habitat. Willow species included in the research were: <b>S.</b> lemmonii (Lemmon <b>willow),</b> <b>S.</b> scouleriana (Scouler <b>willow),</b> <b>S.</b> boothii (Booth <b>willow),</b> <b>S.</b> geyeriana (Geyer <b>willow),</b> <b>S.</b> exigua (coyote <b>willow),</b> <b>S.</b> lasiandra (whiplash <b>willow),</b> and <b>S.</b> lutea (yellow <b>willow).</b> The habitat parameters measured were: height and distance of willow individual from stream channel bankfull elevation, stream channel slope, entrenchment ratio, width-to-depth ratio, watershed elevation, valley azimuth, valley width, soil rock size distribution, soil texture, and winter air temperature. Logistic regression models were built to describe probabilities of occurrence for five out of the seven willow species based on the habitat data collected. Multi-response permutation procedures were performed to describe differences between respective willow habitats. Booth and Geyer willow habitats were best described by watershed elevation as these species dominated the research stream channel’s upper reaches. Whiplash willow habitat was best described by stream channel entrenchment and width-to-depth ratio as this species occurred, on average, in habitats with high stream channel entrenchment and width-to-depth ratios. Specifically, the odds of whiplash willow occurrence are expected to increase by 17...|$|R

Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I. acuta and I. lacera var. helobia.|$|R

40|$|Leucostoma niveum, a fungus, {{causes a}} canker and dieback disease on aspen (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) {{as well as}} several other {{hardwood}} trees and shrub species. Susceptible hosts of this pathogen often are previously stressed by competition with neighboring vegetation, drought, nutritional deficiency, winter injury, and/or wounding. Therefore, L. niveum (hereafter referred to as Leucostoma) is considered an opportunistic pathogen, capable of colonizing stems or twigs either injured or weakened by other causes. Leucostoma canker occurs throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. The pathogen, L. niveum, causes disease on a broad range of hosts including alder (Alnus spp.), birch (Betula spp.), ironwood (Carpinus spp.), mountain ash (Sorbus spp.), aspen, and willow. Although the disease has been reported to affect 10 Salix species, descriptions depicting the disease cycle or damage of Leucostoma on susceptible willows in North America are limited to weeping (S. babylonica), black (S. nigra), and pussy (<b>S.</b> discolor) <b>willows.</b> However, in a 2009 survey of three coppice plantations in NY State, fantail (S. sachalinensis) and goat (<b>S.</b> caprea) <b>willows,</b> two Eurasian species, were the only shrubs affected by this pathogen.

40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} are vital components of aridlands within the southwestern United States. Historically, surface flows influenced population dynamics of native riparian trees. Many southwestern streams has been altered by regulation, however, {{and will be}} further affected by greenhouse warming. Our analysis of stream gage data revealed that decreases in volume of annual discharge and mean peak discharge and a shift to earlier peak discharge will occur in the Southern Rockies region of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. These changes will likely decrease rates of reproduction and survival of cottonwood (Populus fremontii and Populus deltoides ssp. wislizenii), Goodding 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix gooddingii), and boxelder (Acer negundo), which rely on surface flows to stimulate germination and recharge groundwater aquifers. Streams in the Central Highlands of Arizona and New Mexico will likely see reductions in annual discharge volume, which could limit reproduction and survival of the above taxa and Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii). These effects may be exacerbated by demands of expanding urban areas and agricultural operations, but could also be ameliorated by increasing water use efficiency and environmental mitigation. These factors must be considered, along with climate projections, when planning for conservation of riparian trees and the animal communities they support...|$|R

30|$|For {{many species}} of plants that have seeds {{dispersed}} by gravity or wind after fire, the highest likelihood of establishment is from those seeds that land on bare mineral soil (Miller 2000). Reasons for this include improved moisture and nutrient availability, decreased competition, and destruction of allelopathic chemicals in plant litter that inhibit germination. Schimmel and Granström (1996) reported that aerial seeders are favored by seed beds {{with a high degree}} of organic matter consumption, while the results of Zasada et al. (1983) are more extreme. They described the results of artificial seeding on experimentally burned sites in interior Alaska upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) and feathermoss (Hypnaceae) stands. In three burn units with differing burn severity (and, thus, duff consumption levels), a fixed number of seeds of eight native woody species were sown onto 1 m 2 plots in October or June, depending on the timing of their natural dispersal date. Seeded species included paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), alder (Alnus viridis [Chaix] DC ssp. crispa [Aiton] Turrill), black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (P. balsamifera L.), feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis [Andersson] Coville), Scouler <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> scouleriana Barratt ex Hook.), and Bebb <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> bebbiana Sarg.). By the third year, of the 1322 seedlings still alive on experimental blocks, 1316 were growing on the heavily burned seed beds. Improved models of organic layer consumption that include bare mineral soil seed bed creation would enhance our ability to model the establishment from seeds (e.g., Miyanishi and Johnson 2002).|$|R

In a five-year study, we found no difference in temporal variability of leaf beetle populations between managed and natural willow stands. However, drastic increases in leaf beetle density (‘outbreaks’) {{tended to be more}} frequent in managed stands. The two willow species studied responded differently to leaf beetle attack. The natural <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> cinerea) responded to grazing by adult beetles by producing new leaves with an increased density of trichomes (leaf hairs). Larvae were shown deterred from feeding on the induced leaves. This type of plant response may reduce the overall damage done by leaf beetles. However, no induced defence in response to adult grazing could be detected for the willow used in plantations, S. viminalis. Among the main predators attacking egg aggregations laid by leaf beetles, one type (mirid bugs) often stay and consume most eggs before moving on to search for other prey, a behaviour characterised as ‘find and stay’. Another type (anthocorid bugs) have more of a ‘run and eat’ behaviour; they visit many aggregations but consume fewer eggs within aggregations than mirids. In a simulation model, populations of leaf beetles were less likely to establish and to increase in abundance when attacked by ‘find and stay’ predators than when attacked by ‘run and eat’ predators. In the field, the leaf beetle P. vulgatissima occurred at low densities, and the predation on eggs was high, in natural willow stands where ‘find and stay’ mirids were abundant. The results suggest that a high abundance of heteropteran predators may prevent outbreaks of the leaf beetle P. vulgatissima...|$|R

40|$|Prior to 1968, the National Park Service {{contended that}} an unnaturally large {{population}} of elk had severely damaged Yellowstone Park 2 ̆ 7 s northern winter range, including aspen and willow communities. However, under 2 ̆ 2 natural regulation 2 ̆ 2 management adopted in the earl y 1970 s the agency now believes that vegetation changes in the park are due to normal plant succession, climatic change, or fire suppression, not ungulates. The agency also believes {{that large numbers of}} elk (12, 000 - 15, 000) have wintered on the park 2 ̆ 7 s northern range for the last several thousand years. This study tested several of the major assumptions or predictions of the Park Service 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 natural regulation 2 ̆ 2 paradigm by collecting vegetational data, reviewing historical source materials, and analyzing archaeological reports.

As {{a result of these}} studies, NDOW initiated a contract in 1986 with the Lake Mead Research Center (LMRC) to investigate means of improving habitat for game fish by introducing natural and/or artificial cover. During Phase I (1986 - 1987) of this contract, the shoreline of Lake Mead was surveyed for aquatic and terrestrial plant growth. Also during this time, submerged Christmas trees and Berkley Fish Habitat Modules were evaluated for their effectiveness in providing cover. Christmas trees appeared to provide cover for juvenile bluegill, a largemouth bass prey species. However, submerged trees lost their structure in about three years. Berkley Habitat Modules {{did not appear to be}} an effective form of cover. The National Park Service (NPS) asked that the introduction of artificial forms of cover not be continued until research was completed on the use of native plant material. Methods for aquatic and terrestrial plant introductions were determined during Phase II (1987 - 1988) of this contract. Other agencies and individuals involved in revegetation of reservoir inundation zones were contacted, and the literature was reviewed for plant material collecting procedures, planting guidelines, and site maintenance. A 2 ̆ 2 Plant Introduction Manual 2 ̆ 2 was compiled based on this information and was approved by the National Park Service for use in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. During the winter, dormant cuttings were taken of two woody species, Goodding 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Willow</b> and seepwillow baccharis (Salix gooddingii and Baccharis glutinosa) to be planted in the spring of 1988. In addition, collections were made of three emergent species (Typha angustifolia, Scirpus robustus, and Phragmites australis). Plant material was transported to the Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF) nursery where it was rooted and placed on pots for planting in May 1988. Sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers were introduced into small study plots in the spring of 1987. More tubers became established and were healthier in fertilized plots than in unfertilized plots. During Phase III (1988 - 1989) of this study, plant material was introduced into one cove in the lower basin and two coves in the upper basin of Lake Mead in April and May of 1988. Unpredicted low lake levels resulted in the loss of many plants. Survival rates of rooted material, however, were better than those of direct cuttings of woody plants. Site selection, particularly the soils of the site, appears to play a large part in survival. Seepwillow baccharis had the highest survival rates. In addition, greenhouse studies {{indicate that}} emergent plant tubers have some tolerance to dessication. Twelve hundred sago pondweed tubers were planted in April 1988 in one cove in the upper basin, and 1, 200 tubers were planted in a cove in the lower basin. Tubers had 100 percent germination success and provided 70 percent cover for fish by July 1988. Approximately 10, 000 sago pondweed tubers were planted in April 1989 in Waterbarge Cove in the lower basin. Tubers were planted in water depths ranging from very shallow to 12 - 15 meters deep. Germination and establishment of tubers were very good in depths less than 7 meters; however, little or no germination of tubers was noted at depths greater than 7 meters. A one-acre area of shoreline was hydroseeded in October 1988. Germination and establishment of seedlings was highest where soil moisture was between 20 and 30 percent. However, many seedlings were lost when water levels began to rise in January 1989...|$|R

We investi-gated the stress response of first-year pioneer riparian seedlings to experimental water table declines (0, 1 and 3 cm day- 1), focusing on the three dominant cottonwood and willows (family Salicaceae) in California’s San Joa-quin Basin. We analyzed growth and belowground allo-cation response to water stress, and used logistic regression to determine if these traits had an influence on individual survival. The models indicate that high root growth ([3 mm day- 1) and low shoot:root ratios (. 5 g g- 1) strongly predicted survival, but {{there was no evidence that}} plants increased belowground allocation in response to drawdown. Leaf d 13 C values shifted most for the best-surviving species (net change of? 3. 5 per mil from- 30. 0 ± 0. 3 control values for Goodding’s willow, Salix gooddingii), implying an important role of increased water-use efficiency for surviving water stress. Both S. gooddingii and sandbar <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> exigua) reduced leaf size from controls, whereas Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) sustained a 29...|$|R
40|$|The Middle Rio Grande (MRG) {{passes through}} {{semi-arid}} and arid landscapes as it descends from Otowi to Elephant Butte, New Mexico (fig. 1). With average annual precipitation declining over these 372 km, {{most of the}} water resources available to riparian vegetation is supplied from upstream through the shallow alluvial aquifer that surrounds the Rio Grande. Historically, the MRG floodplain hosted small Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizennii) copses, riverbank cottonwood and Goodding willow (Salix gooddingii) individuals, riverbank coyote <b>willow</b> (<b>S.</b> exigua) thickets, and wide expanses of grasses such as saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) (Scurlock 1998). These riparian areas have become dense with native and non-native vegetation, where monospecific and mixed xeroriparian saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) thickets dominate the bosque {{to the south of}} the Rio Puerco confluence and dense cottonwood, saltcedar, and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) forests dominate in the northern MRG. In either case, this dense vegetation presents a fire hazard and is potentially responsible for a great deal of water loss to the atmosphere. The Rio Grande Compact dictates how much water may be legally lost between official river discharge gauges. In the MRG, the upstream and downstream gauges of record were changed to Otowi and Elephan...|$|R
