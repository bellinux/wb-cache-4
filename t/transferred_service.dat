25|$|President Carlos Salinas, {{elected in}} 1988, began a {{significant}} sector reform, creating the National Water Commission or Comisión Nacional del Agua (CONAGUA) in 1989, which today remains {{a key player}} in Mexican water supply and sanitation (see below). At the beginning, it was given the task of defining federal policies to strengthen service providers through technical assistance and financial resources. CONAGUA, among other suggestions soon recommended to strengthen the decentralization process, improve the transparency of tariffs and introduce tariff autonomy, based on real costs for the service provision and free of political influence. Consequently, many water laws were introduced or amended, partly following CONAGUA's guidelines. In 1996, 21 states had <b>transferred</b> <b>service</b> provision to municipal service providers.|$|E

3000|$|Equation 9 {{is derived}} {{considering}} that the Web Browsing service sessions in the WLAN {{are not able to}} constitute a virtual [...] " [...] long-live" [...] TCP session. An active File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> session can be considered as one [...] "long-live" [...] TCP session. As the value of encp is smaller than the number of File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions plus one, it means that, by neglecting the File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions, the Web Browsing service sessions cannot make the value of encp {{greater than or equal to}} one. Such result indicates that, on average, there is less than one Web Browsing service packet in contention to access the network channel at any time. Therefore, from a Web Browsing service session's point of view, during the ON period, the major competition it will face is from the active File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions rather than the peer Web Browsing service sessions. Therefore, the effective packet transmission rate for the Web Browsing service session can be calculated as wlan_data_rate/(n_ftp_session+ 1).|$|R
