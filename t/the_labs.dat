5|$|On {{the way to}} the Delta Labs, {{the marine}} is {{contacted}} by Betruger, who is now clearly shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth. If the marine did not send the distress call to Earth, Betruger does so himself, hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth. Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marine using the toxic gases in the base's recycling facilities. Upon arriving at the Delta Labs, the marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments, expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger's increasing obsession with the tests, as well as of an archaeological dig under the surface of Mars. The dig is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars, and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube. According to a scientist the marine finds alive in <b>the</b> <b>labs,</b> the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell. The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal {{at the beginning of the}} game, depositing it in Hell. The marine pursues Betruger through <b>the</b> <b>labs,</b> but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of <b>the</b> <b>labs,</b> suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E

5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. <b>The</b> <b>labs</b> meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.|$|E

25|$|Mueller {{increasingly}} {{believed that}} {{to move up}} {{in the hierarchy of}} <b>the</b> <b>Labs</b> he would need a PhD, and he began working towards this goal on a part-time basis at Princeton University, getting up every morning at around 5 o'clock and driving to Princeton to take a couple of courses before driving back down to Holmdel to work all day at Bell Labs. In 1946 a colleague at <b>the</b> <b>Labs,</b> Milton Boone, a professor from Ohio State University on leave at Bell Labs during the war, encouraged Mueller to help set up a vacuum tube lab and run the communications group at Ohio State.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 the SSOL {{was changed}} to the Space Systems and Controls Lab as new {{leadership}} took over and to reflect some of <b>the</b> changes <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> had undergone. <b>The</b> SSCL continues with a focus in space systems and has expanded to several new areas.

25|$|Cinematographers do not “white balance” in {{the same}} way as video camera operators; they use {{techniques}} such as filters, choice of film stock, pre-flashing, and, after shooting, color grading, both by exposure at <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> and also digitally. Cinematographers also work closely with set designers and lighting crews to achieve the desired color effects.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November, the United Kingdom {{announced}} plans to build three more Ebola laboratories in Sierra Leone. <b>The</b> <b>labs</b> helped {{to determine if a}} patient had been infected by the Ebola virus.

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became the director of <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from <b>the</b> <b>lab's</b> High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded <b>the</b> <b>lab's</b> program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|R

40|$|Laboratories are a {{means by}} which {{students}} take a hands-on approach and practice concepts learned in class lectures under real or close-to-real world settings. This provides a kinesthetic method of learning which rounds out the auditory methods typical of a lecture course. Unfortunately, many students spend most of <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> time troubleshooting their experiment instead of deepening their understanding of the concepts taught in class. This causes frustration and anxiety amongst students. In our opinion, this is {{due to a lack of}} knowledge of equipment used in <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> as well as training on different equipment in previous classes. We have developed a video tutorial series for our Biomedical Measurements class that teaches basic circuit building, equipment set-up, and equipment use - students may watch these videos before <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> and at any moment during <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> Thus far, post-semester surveys have indicated that all respondents, whether bio-electrical, pre-medical, or bio-mechanical concentration in biomedical engineering, find the video tutorials helpful in <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> <b>The</b> incorporation of technology in <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> session ensures that <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> time is spent deepening conceptual knowledge instead of troubleshooting circuits...|$|R

25|$|In 1941, the {{laboratories}} at Fort Monmouth developed the SCR-300, the first FM backpack radio.

Multichannel radio broadcasting allowed several channels of communications to be broadcast over a single radio signal, increasing security and range and relieving frequency spectrum crowding.|$|E
