Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein.

5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier.

5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons <b>the</b> cat <b>brain</b> is a goal of {{computer}} simulations. Cats are familiar and easily kept animals, so the physiology of cats has been particularly well studied. The physical structures of human brains and cat brains are very similar.

5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
