40|$|Several {{methods and}} {{techniques}} have been advo-cated {{in recent years}} to help students become better writers. Advocates of the communicative approach stress that communication is a central and important goal of writing, and thus students are being taught to consider their audience and <b>their</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> (Raimes, 1983, pp. 8 - 9). The Language Experience Approach, evidence of how schema research has af-fected the way we look at student writing, encourages students to use familiar experiences and known lan-guage to create texts (Gunderson. 1991, pp. 64 - 65). The Whole Language Approach has influenced teach-ers to integrate writing along with reading, listening, and speaking in the classroom (Gunderson, 199 I. p. 16). Many ESL researchers and teachers see the writ...|$|E
40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{students and}} practicing engineers {{to all the}} components of writing in the workplace. It teaches readers how considerations of audience and purpose govern the structure of their documents within particular work settings. The IEEE Guide to Writing in the Engineering and Technical Fields is broken up into two sections: "Writing in Engineering Organizations" and "What Can You Do With Writing?" The first section helps readers approach their writing in a logical and persuasive way as well as analyze <b>their</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing.</b> The second section demonstrates how to distinguish rhetorical situations and the generic forms to inform, train, persuade, and collaborate. The emergence of the global workplace has brought with it an increasingly important role for effective technical communication. Engineers more often need to work in cross-functional teams with people in different disciplines, in different countries, and {{in different parts of}} the world. Engineers must know how to communicate in a rapidly evolving global environment, as both practitioners of global English and developers of technical documents. Effective communication is critical in these settings. The IEEE Guide to Writing in the Engineering and Technical Fields: Addresses the increasing demand for technical writing courses geared toward engineers Allows readers to perfect their writing skills in order to present knowledge and ideas to clients, government representatives, and the general public Covers topics most important to the working engineer The IEEE Guide to Writing in the Engineering and Technical Fields is a handbook developed specifically for engineers and engineering students. Using an argumentation framewor, the handbook presents information about forms of engineering communication in a clear and accessible format. This book introduces both forms that are characteristic of the engineering workplace and principles of logic and rhetoric that underlie these forms. As a result, students and practicing engineers can improve their writing in any situation they encounter, because they can use these principles to analyze audience, purpose, tone, and form...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} Paul's self-presentation in Galatians, Philippians, and 1 Corinthians {{in order to}} determine the purpose of each letter and Paul's relationship to each community. A fundamental premise of this study is that Paul did not provide communities with autobiographical information so that they might possess a more robust portrait of Paul. Rather, the information he provided was carefully selected in order to fit the needs of each audience and to increase the chance of success for each letter. I begin by identifying and examining Paul's four primary categories of self-presentation: deeds, personal suffering, self-effacing language, and agent of God. Then, I examine the Greco-Roman rhetorical handbooks, speeches, and letters, and I note that they all contain similar categories and techniques for self-presentation, including the four categories outlined by this study. From this examination I demonstrate that awareness of the proper methods of self-presentation was not restricted to those who received a formal rhetorical training but that all educated individuals such as Paul of Tarsus would have been aware of the categories and techniques outlined in the handbooks because were "in the air. " Next, I examine Galatians, Philippians and 1 Corinthians by focusing on Paul's self-{{in order to determine}} his <b>purpose</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> each letter and his relationship with each audience. Using this approach I am able to confirm the scholarly consensus concerning Paul's relationship with the Galatians and Philippians. Moreover, I confirm the scholarly consensus concerning the purpose of Paul's letter to the Galatians, concluding that the letter serves as a self-defense. However, this approach also provides new insights regarding Paul's <b>purpose</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> to the Philippians and the interpretation of many difficult passages. For instance, I am able to conclude that a primary <b>purpose</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> to the Philippians is to address their recent gift, and I note that Paul prepares the community throughout the letter to accept his potentially insulting claim that God would reciprocate on his behalf. Moreover, by identifying the importance of Paul's self-presentation throughout the letter for the success of his handling of the Philippians gift, I provide further evidence for the unity of the letter...|$|R
