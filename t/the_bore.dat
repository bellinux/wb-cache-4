5|$|Bore: The hollow {{cylinder}} bored down {{the centre of}} the cannon, including the base of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> or bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> the nearest end of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> into which the ordnance (wadding, shot, etc.) gets packed. The diameter of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> represents the cannon's calibre.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E

5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used they had to have their {{ordnance}} packed down <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> through the muzzle rather than inserted through the breech.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{viewpoints}} from which <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths. Crowds often assemble at popular viewing points and car parking may prove difficult. Related to the time of the high tide at Sharpness, <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> passes Newnham on Severn one hour before this, Framilode and Arlingham, twenty-five minutes before, Epney twenty minutes before, Minsterworth at the high tide, Stonebench, on the east bank, fifteen minutes after the high tide and Over Bridge thirty-five minutes afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E

[...] Much of <b>the</b> <b>bored</b> sections are 21–23m below the surface, {{with the lowest}} point at Marino, towards the southern end, a point that also hosts the tunnel's drainage sump.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>boring</b> bar {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used type of tool holders in metal cutting operations. The turning process {{subjects}} the tool to vibrations, and cutting in deep workpiece cavities is likely to result in high vibration levels. The consequences of such vibration levels generally results in: reduced tool life, poor surface finishing and disturbing sound. Internal turning frequently requires a long and slender boring bar in order to machine inside a cavity, and the vibrations generally become highly correlated with one of the fundamental bending modes of <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> bar. Different methods can be applied to reduce the vibrations, the implementation of the most efficient and stable methods require in depth knowledge concerning the dynamic properties of the tooling system. Furthermore, the interface between <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> bar and <b>the</b> clamping house has a significant influence on the dynamic properties of <b>the</b> clamped <b>boring</b> bar.

5|$|On {{days when}} a large bore is expected, {{hundreds}} of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, waiting for the waves to arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals.

5|$|SMS Helgoland, {{the lead}} ship of her class, was a {{dreadnought}} battleship of the German Imperial Navy. Helgolands design represented an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding , including an increase in <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> diameter of the main guns, from 28cm (11in) to 30.5cm (12in). Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1908 at the Howaldtswerke shipyards in Kiel. Helgoland was launched on 25 September 1909 and was commissioned on 23 August 1911.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. <b>The</b> <b>bore</b> behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
