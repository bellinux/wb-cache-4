5|$|Cherry {{was born}} on 4 June 1895 at Drysdale, Victoria, to John Gawley Cherry and his wife Elizabeth, née Russel. When he was seven years old, {{the family moved to}} Tasmania and took up an apple orchard near Cradoc. Cherry {{attended}} the local state school until he was thirteen, after which he received private tuition. He worked with his father and became an expert apple packer; at fourteen he won a local case-making competition at the Launceston Fruit Show by packing thirty-five cases of apples in an hour. Joining the Australian Army Cadets in 1908, Cherry soon became a sergeant and later a second lieutenant, where he used to drill cadets in four different districts. At the age of sixteen, he won the President's Trophy and Gold Medal for being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> at the rifle range in Franklin. He also rowed with the Franklin rowing club, played the cornet in the Franklin brass band and sang in the Anglican church choir. In 1913, Cherry joined the Citizens Military Force and was commissioned into the 93rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant.|$|E

The two medals were awarded to the champions of annual Army and Air Force small-arms marksmanship competitions respectively, at central meetings in the United Kingdom and some countries of the British Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|Shaw {{grew up in}} Belleville, Ontario. When he {{was growing}} up many, {{including}} his own family, believed his younger brother Jason had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> in the NHL. Jason is currently a player in the Ontario Hockey League. Shaw also has an older brother named Josh.|$|E
25|$|Queen Victoria {{authorised}} {{the creation}} of the Medal for <b>the</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Shot</b> in the British Army, Infantry, by Royal Warrant dated 30 April 1869. The medal, initially struck in bronze and from 1872 in silver, was inscribed with the year in which won and the winner's name, number and regiment. It became the winner's property and could be worn by him during the whole of his service. From 1870, the medal was awarded annually, along with a £20 Prize for Skill at Arms, to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> of the Infantry of the British Army, including the Royal Engineers and the Colonial Corps. With only thirteen medals won, award of the medal and the £20 prize ceased after 1882. A £5 prize and a crowned badge of crossed carbines or rifles, worked in gold and worn upon the left arm, was approved to replace it on 10 June 1884.|$|E
50|$|In 1804, each French Line (Ligne) and Light (Légère) {{infantry}} battalion {{was ordered}} to create one company of ninety of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> who would serve as elite skirmishers.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's John Flett, and David Mowat, and Sam Hayes, and Herr Winklemann, and Ian Macdonald, and Louis Lambert--all <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots,</b> I suppose," [...] said Elsie, {{bending over}} her work.|$|R
60|$|Several young {{settlers}} {{followed in}} succession, but their aims were poor. Then little Harry Bennet took his stand. Harry had won many prizes in former matches, {{and many of}} the pioneers considered him one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> in <b>the</b> country.|$|R
25|$|Donaldson {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army on 18 June 2002. He trained at Army Recruit Training Centre, Kapooka, winning prizes as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> and best at {{physical}} training in his platoon. Detailed to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, he then underwent further training at Singleton, where he won prizes again for shooting and physical training, and also as most outstanding soldier in his platoon. He was then posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, based in Townsville, Queensland.|$|E
25|$|Greensome (also {{known as}} Scotch Foursomes): also called {{modified}} alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> as in a scramble. The player {{who did not}} shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome. A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|E
25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E

25|$|It {{turned out}} to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> Ava had at {{toppling}} Razadarit. The Ava armies would not come as close to defeating Razadarit until 1414–15. Swa decided to lead the next invasion in the following dry season himself. What was the largest mobilization yet, nearly 30,000 troops invaded by the Irrawaddy, and by land in late 1386. Swa led the riverborne invasion force (17,000 troops on 1000 small war boats, and 1200 cargo boats) while Tarabya led the army (12,000 troops, 600 cavalry, 40 elephants). Minkhaung stayed behind to guard the capital. This time, Peguan defenses were ready. Although they were outnumbered, Razadarit's over 11,000 troops staved off several Ava attacks at Dagon, Hlaing, Dala (modern Twante) and Hmawbi. The invaders once again had to retreat {{at the close of the}} rainy season.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} week, Raonic {{reached the}} final of an ATP 500 tournament {{for the first time}} at the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships. He defeated Verdasco for the second time in three days in the first round, and world No. 17 Mardy Fish in the semifinal. In the final, he lost in three sets to world No. 8 Roddick, with Roddick making a diving forehand to break serve for the match on his fifth championship point. Roddick stated: [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance." ...|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day, Brigadier-General Walter Congreve, then {{commanding}} 18 Infantry Brigade, stationed near Neuve Chapelle, wrote {{a letter}} recalling the Germans initiated by calling a truce for the day. [...] One of his brigade's men bravely lifted his head above the parapet and others from both sides walked onto no man's land. [...] Officers and men shook hands and exchanged cigarettes and cigars, one of his captains [...] "smoked a cigar with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> in the German army", the latter no more than 18 years old. [...] Congreve admitted {{he was reluctant to}} personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.|$|E
50|$|Alfred J West invented his own shutter and {{stabilising}} {{devices and}} mounted his heavy dry plate {{camera in the}} well of a sailing yawl. This was manoeuvred by his boatman under the lee of large racing yachts to obtain <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> of these heavily-canvassed vessels at full speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Jean; {{it is not}} that," [...] replied D'Arnot, himself smiling. [...] "But {{you take}} the entire matter with such infernal indifference--it is exasperating. One would think {{that you were going}} out to shoot at a target, rather than to face one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> in France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{requires}} considerable {{practice to}} become an expert shot," [...] said the military instructor. [...] "Once in a while we find {{someone who is a}} natural-born sharpshooter, but that is very rare. Some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> in <b>the</b> army are men who, at the start, hardly knew how to handle firearms." ...|$|R
500|$|On March 14, Katsura {{faced the}} undefeated Hoppe, losing 50 to 31 in 36 innings. Though Hoppe was a {{darling of the}} public, the crowd of more than 500 spectators was clearly rooting for Katsura throughout. The next day she faced her mentor, Matsuyama, {{considered}} the contender with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> at beating Hoppe. Matsuyama edged out his protégé with a close 50 to 48 finish in 51 innings. By the 21st inning Matsuyama held a 29–21 lead. Katsura battled back, the score 43–42 in her favor by inning 33, but Matsuyama ran three in the 46th inning, and Katsura could not close the gap. Mentor and protégé alike posted high runs of six in the match ...|$|E
500|$|Nécib {{began her}} career as a youth player for her {{hometown}} club Union Sportive de Marseille. After spending two years at the club, she signed on with nearby Celtic de Marseille. Nécib spent six months developing in the academy and, in April 2002, she was selected to attend the under-16 female National Cup representing her region. The competition served as a training camp for the Centre National de Formation et d'Entraînement (CNFE) (...) located at the Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. The initiative to allow women to train at the famous national center came about in the 1990s {{due to the fact that}} it had quickly become a high-level training facility for male football players. As a result of allowing female football players to train at the academy, younger women were afforded the same benefits from the facilities offered by Clairefontaine as the men. At the National Cup, Nécib impressed and was given an award by coaches for possessing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> of any player. After the competition, she returned to Celtic.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN called [...] "The Dark Defender" [...] "a very {{satisfying}} {{episode of the}} show" [...] and thought that [...] "so far [...] {{doing a very good}} job" [...] of replicating the tension seen in the first season. He was impressed by Dexter's discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father, but called Debra's romance with Gabriel a [...] "less successful" [...] storyline. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Tom O'Neil called the episode a [...] "standout" [...] because of the parts of Dexter's past that it explored. He stated that, for regular viewers, [...] "this episode is a real knockout", but for unfamiliar viewers, [...] "this whole Dark Defender bit might look pretty corny". TV Squad's Keith McDuffee believed the revelation of Laura's affair with Harry to be [...] "certainly the most shocking moment of the episode", and thought that [...] "One of the brilliant moments of the season so far was Dexter going after one of his mom's killers." [...] Paula Paige of TV Guide called Dexter's monologue about his hollowness [...] "very moving". She thought that his confrontation with his mother's killer [...] "may have been one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> [...] in the whole series". Blogcritics Ray Ellis praised the [...] "razor-sharp sense of humor" [...] seen in the episode and thought that [...] "In a season of mostly dreary, bland series, Dexter remains the most daring show on television." [...] Dexter and Jimenez's confrontation was named Hall's best scene by Variety critic Stuart Levine.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Field (1772-1807) {{was born}} in Kentucky. Like his brother, Reubin, they were {{considered}} to be among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> and hunters in the Corps of Discovery. Along with his brother and George Drouillard, they often accompanied the captains on special reconnaissance missions. Both brothers were present with Lewis in the fight with the Blackfeet on July 17, 1806.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{the bags}} were taken onto the roof, the defenders, keeping as much as {{possible}} under the shelter of the parapet, carried them to the corners of the terrace and piled them two deep, thus forming a breastwork four feet high. Eight of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shots</b> were then chosen, and two of them took post at each corner.|$|R
2500|$|Much of Lalonde’s {{production}} {{came from}} his highly accurate snap shot, and his remarkable longevity which allowed him to play a physically aggressive style for upwards of 23 seasons. Lester Patrick, co-founder of the PCHA and then-captain of the Victoria Aristocrats, claimed in 1912 that Lalonde possessed <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> in hockey: “He shoots every bit as hard as Pitre, and is much more deadly".|$|E
2500|$|At a grand {{reception}} for Buffalo Bill's troupe at the Hotel Brevoort, Pawnee Bill, Dolly, and Frank also plot a merger {{of the two}} companies, assuming Buffalo Bill's show made a fortune touring Europe. When they all meet, they soon discover both shows are broke. Annie, however, has received sharpshooting medals from all the rulers of Europe worth one hundred thousand dollars, and she decides to sell the medals to finance the merger, rejoicing in the simple things ("I Got the Sun in the Mornin'"). [...] When Frank appears, he and Annie confess their love and decide to marry, although with comically different ideas: Frank wants [...] "some little chapel," [...] while Annie wants [...] "A wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls/ A lot of ushers in tail coats/ Reporters and photographers" [...] ("An Old-Fashioned Wedding"º). When Annie shows Frank her medals, Frank again has his pride hurt. [...] They call off the merger and the wedding, but challenge each other to one last shooting match to decide who is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

She was trained by Oleg Lakerbay and Dmitri Markov during those periods. As a {{teenager}} she quickly established herself among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shot</b> putters in the world, with a throw of [...] in 1935. A mark of [...] the year after was the best during that wartime year and she also ranked number one in 1943 and 1944. She placed herself at the peak of the sport nationally with wins at the Soviet Athletics Championships in 1939 and 1940, then again in 1944 and 1945. With the end of World War II she added nearly a metre to her personal best in October 1945 with a throw of , then improved further to [...] later that month.
