5|$|The Chilean {{angelshark}} (Squatina armata) of <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> Pacific was synonymized {{with this}} species by Kato, Springer and Wagner in 1967, but was later tentatively {{recognized as a}} separate species again by Leonard Compagno.

The angel sharks inhabiting the Gulf of California may also represent a different species, as they mature at a much smaller size than those from the rest of their range.|$|E

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> portion of the state on August18.|$|E
