5000|$|Drum mixers (reversing {{drum mixer}} and <b>tilting</b> <b>drum</b> mixers), used where large volumes (batch sizes of [...] ) are being produced. This type of mixer dominates the ready-mixed market {{as it is}} capable of high {{production}} speeds, ideal for slump concrete, and where overall cost of production is important. Drum mixers have the lowest maintenance and operating cost of the three styles of mixers.|$|E
30|$|The {{data sets}} used for {{training}} and testing was obtained experimentally. SCC was tested for its rheological and hardened stage properties. The rheological properties of SCC like flowability, passing ability and segregation resistance were tested. For hardened properties SCC was tested for its compressive strength. As the mixing process affect {{the properties of the}} concrete, the mixing sequence and time of mixing were kept the same throughout the preparation of the training and testing data. The materials were mixed using a <b>tilting</b> <b>drum</b> mixer. Initially dry mixing of the materials (cement, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate) was done for 3  min and then 70 % of the mixing water is added to the mixer and mixing is done for 2  min. Superplasticizer along with remaining (30 %) water is added after that and mixed for 2  min.|$|E
50|$|It has {{similarities}} to <b>Drum</b> <b>Tilt,</b> but unlike <b>Drum</b> <b>Tilt,</b> Muff Cob elevates to track its target, {{and is considered}} to be much more stable. It is usually twinned with an AK-725-MR-103 Fire Control System, and is fitted with a television camera to video its target.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as <b>Tilt</b> <b>Drum,</b> Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a <b>tilt</b> <b>drum</b> style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|R
5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either <b>tilt</b> <b>drum</b> or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} remote-directed, {{typically}} by a fire-control system linked {{to either a}} <b>Drum</b> <b>Tilt</b> or Muff Cobb radar systems.|$|R
50|$|Most washer dryer {{combination}} {{units are}} of the front-loading design. This allows for easier access, better efficiency, and more effective washes than top-loading designs. Instead of just leaving the clothes to soak in the water throughout the entire wash, like a top-loading machine would do, the front-loading design <b>tilts</b> the <b>drum</b> on its side, so that {{the contents of the}} drum are repeatedly lifted {{in and out of the}} water throughout the wash cycle.|$|R
50|$|The AK-230 gun was a fully automatic, stabilized, NN-30 double-barrel, water-cooled, four-chamber {{revolver}} cannon. The guns had a 1,000 round {{per minute}} (rpm) rate of fire and were fed by independent 500 round ammunition belts. The regular associated radar system was the (NATO codename) <b>DRUM</b> <b>TILT</b> radar, which was not used in the Parchim class. According to some sources the AK-230 could not only be linked with the <b>DRUM</b> <b>TILT</b> {{but also with the}} MUFF COB radar system, but this is disputed by old East German naval sources. According to these East German sources, the AK-230 gun on the Parchim-class corvette was optically guided, thereby leaving the Parchim class without an effective CIWS, and therefore unable to counter anti-shipping missiles.|$|R
50|$|These {{concrete}} mixers {{are further}} divided {{based on their}} loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other aggregates are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured in the mixing drum for final mixing and then can be unloaded by <b>tilting</b> the <b>drum.</b> While in Hand Feed Concrete Mixers, cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. These both type of concrete mixers are highly popular and used in regular construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern Countries and in the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Intelligent Mobile Sensor System (IMSS) project is to develop an operational system for monitoring and inspection activities for waste storage facility operations at several DOE sites. Specifically, the product of this effort is a robotic device with enhanced intelligence and maneuverability capable of conducting routine inspection of stored waste drums. The device is capable of operating in the narrow free aisle space between rows of stacked drums. The system has an integrated sensor suite for problem-drum detection, and is linked to a site database both for inspection planning and for data correlation, updating, and report generation. The system is capable of departing on an assigned mission, collecting required data, recording which portions of its mission had to be aborted or modified due to environmental constraints, and reporting back when the mission is complete. Successful identification of more than 96 % of drum defects has been demonstrated in a high fidelity waste storage facility mockup. Identified anomalies included rust spots, rust streaks, areas of corrosion, dents, and <b>tilted</b> <b>drums.</b> All drums were positively identified and correlated with the site database. This development effort is separated into three phases of which phase two is now complete. The first phase demonstrated an integrated system (maturity level IVa) for monitoring and inspection activities for waste storage facility operations. The second phase demonstrated a prototype system appropriate for operational use in an actual storage facility. The prototype provides an integrated design that considers operational requirements, hardware costs, maintenance, safety, and robustness. The final phase will demonstrate commercial viability using the prototype vehicle in a pilot waste operations and inspection project. This report summarizes the design and evaluation of the new IMSS Phase 2 system and vehicle...|$|R
25|$|The older, {{traditional}} {{pattern has}} two arms that pivot, {{and one that}} slides to accommodate varying sizes of drum. This is satisfactory for a <b>tilted</b> drum; The <b>drum</b> is <b>tilted</b> away from the sliding arm and rests on the two pivoting arms. If it is horizontal, or tilted the wrong way by inexpert players, then the drum is insecure.|$|R
60|$|He <b>tilted</b> the <b>drum</b> and its {{lightness}} {{indicated that}} there was not much inside. Then he turned it round carefully until he could see the brass label on the top. The letters were obscured by paint, but he distinguished JES--and was satisfied. He knew the famous anti-fouling composition; the crew had put on the last coat and, so far as her being painted went, the tug was ready for sea. Now he must look at her engines, and he put back the drum. Its rim jarred on the deck and Marston thought he heard a movement below. Stooping down, he looked under the tarpaulin and got something of a shock.|$|R
50|$|Below-hook drum handler is {{commonly}} used to lift, <b>tilt</b> and pour <b>drums.</b> It is made with premium grade stainless steel and features hydraulic powered lifting mechanism with chain puller. It features a grip which holds the drum below the third ribbing or underneath. It also has lifting eyes or fork packets for added support. Examples of below-hook drum handler are drum pourers and drum lift carriers.|$|R
50|$|This grip {{is called}} {{traditional}} because it descends from military marching drummers who carried a snare drum on a sling {{hung from the}} neck or one shoulder, with the drum riding closer to one hip than the other and tilted slightly for easier reach. This allowed the drummer to play the drum and march without banging his knees or thighs into the drum. Because of that drum position, using an overhand grip on the high (left) side of the drum would force the elbow into a very awkward position while an underhand grip is much more comfortable. Even when the drum is on a stand, many drummers will <b>tilt</b> their <b>drum</b> when using traditional grip, although tilting is not required. Many drummers use traditional grip on drums that are perfectly horizontal, especially in marching percussion.|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} Najin-class ship appears to {{upgraded}} {{with much more}} modern weaponry in 2014. Refitted at Namp'o, the outdated anti-ship missiles, aft 57mm dual cannon, <b>Drum</b> <b>Tilt</b> fire-control radar and surface search radar were removed, and several new systems were installed. Most clearly identifiable are two 30mm automated turrets at the aft, likely based on the Soviet AK-630 CIWS, and two Kh-35 missile racks with the capacity for some 8 missiles {{in place of the}} older Styx/HY-2 launchers. The modernization program appears to be continuing as of December 2014.|$|R

This is satisfactory for a <b>tilted</b> drum; The <b>drum</b> is <b>tilted</b> away from the sliding arm and rests on the two pivoting arms. If it is horizontal, or tilted the wrong way by inexpert players, then the drum is insecure.The newer patterns use a symmetrical basket with a central screw adjustment, allowing the basket to be tightened onto the lower rim and the drum to be firmly held at any angle. They differ mainly in sturdiness and in the precise mechanism used for the screw adjustment.|$|R
5000|$|Principal {{armament}} of {{the class}} consisted of four OTA-53-206M torpedo tubes located on the sides. The 533 mm torpedoes were ejected by a powder charge and, depending on version, had a rudimentary homing ability or were straight run only. Surface search and targeting information for the torpedo attack was obtained by the MR-102 [...] "Baklan" [...] (NATO designation: Pot Drum) radar with a search range of [...] Defensive armament is made of two AK-230 CIWS located on the bow and the stern, guided by the MR-104 [...] "Rys" [...] (NATO designation: <b>Drum</b> <b>Tilt)</b> radar with a maximum tracking range of [...] Secondary armament that could be carried included twelve BB-1 depth charges or six naval mines.|$|R
40|$|Experiment {{shows that}} dumbbells, placed inside a <b>tilted</b> hollow {{cylindrical}} <b>drum</b> that rotates slowly around its axis, climb uphill by forming dynamically stable pairs, seemingly against {{the pull of}} gravity. Analysis of this experiment shows that the dynamics takes place in an underlying space which is a curvilinear polyhedron inside a six dimensional manifold, carved out by unilateral constraints that arise from the non-interpenetrability of the dumbbells. The energetics over this polyhedron localizes the configuration point within the close proximity of {{a corner of the}} polyhedron. This results into a strong entrapment, which provides the configuration of the dumbbells with its observed shape that leads to its functionality [...] uphill locomotion. The stability of the configuration is a consequence of the strong entrapment {{in the corner of the}} polyhedron. Comment: 16 pages, 17 figures.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{additional}} power on spinning satellites required development of deployable solar arrays activated, as on a 3 -axis vehicle, after separation from a booster or shuttle orbiter. Mechanisms were developed for telescopically extending a secondary 36. 3 kg (80 lb.), 2. 13 m (84 in.) diameter spinning solar drum for a distance of 2. 0 m (80 in.) or more along the spin axis. After extension, the system has the capability of dynamically controlling the <b>drum</b> <b>tilt</b> angle about the spin axis to provide precision in-orbit balancing of the spacecraft. This approach was selected for the SBS, ANIK C, ANIK D, WESTAR B and PALAPA B satellites. It was successfully demonstrated during the in orbit deployment of the aft solar panels of the SBS F- 3 and F- 1 satellites, subsequent to the November 1980 and September 1981 launches...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-Gravity Separator (MGS) is novel {{enhanced}} gravity {{equipment for}} the separation ultra-fine minerals. The present investigation studied {{on the effects of}} different process variables on the performance of a multi-gravity separator for concentration of ultra-fine ferruginous chromite. The results revealed that, shake amplitude and wash water flow rate play a dominant role in controlling the grade (%Cr 2 O 3) of the concentrate fraction whereas <b>tilt</b> angle and <b>drum</b> speed influence much on the recovery (%Cr 2 O 3) of the concentrate fraction. It was found that the MGS could produce a concentrate of 45. 69 % Cr 2 O 3 with 56. 41 % recovery from a feed assaying 21. 06 % Cr 2 O 3 and 23. 02 % of Fe(T). In addition to this, optimized conditions were determined for producing metallurgical grade chromite concentrate (> 40 % Cr 2 O 3) with 60 % recovery. Different correlations were made for predicting the silica and iron content of the concentrate fraction...|$|R
