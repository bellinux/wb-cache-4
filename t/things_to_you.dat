25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fowler interrogated me: [...] "But {{suppose a}} phantom form {{resembling}} 'E. A.' had spoken these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> face to face--what then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} signify? We don't ask {{what a woman}} does; we ask whom she belongs to. It's {{altogether}} a degrading <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> think of marrying old Tulliver's daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you know}} all about it," [...] {{he said at the}} end, [...] "and I leave the whole <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> If you prefer, you can see Mrs. March. I don't know but I'd rather you'd satisfy yourself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Just. That's {{very kind}} in you, my dear; but if it's the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my dear, I had as soon recover, notwithstanding.--What, doctor, no assistance! ...|$|R
60|$|VIOLET. It's too ridiculous. You {{know how}} I dislike saying such <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Hector; but if I were to--oh, well, no matter.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. I {{like talking}} to you. I can let myself go with you. I can say <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I cant say to other people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am. I am the {{representative}} of the Liberal Parliamentary Committee, and I am empowered to say these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and more.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{go right}} in," [...] replied Mr. Holiday. [...] "Pay no {{attention}} to the soldiers. They will not say any <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> They are only sentinels.|$|R
6000|$|... "As much as {{you think}} it best," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I leave every <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You see, our dinner at the hotel would not be less than seven shillings, and that we shall save; {{so that if you}} don't spend more than seven shillings you will be safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does it {{not appear}} an {{extraordinary}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Dr. Arrowsmith, that if, as it seems, Miss Carne did not awake, the murderer {{should have taken}} her life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|COADE. The whistle. It is {{a whistle}} I--Gone! {{of course it}} is. It's rather a pity, but ... (Anxious.) Have I been saying awful <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{again is}} not true," [...] she replied. [...] "I {{would ask for}} {{permission}} to explain all these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{if it were not}} so hopeless." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pray do not tip {{your nose}} in scorn [...] At things which others eat, [...] For <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{not good at}} all [...] To others are most sweet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{that shows}} that I am right in {{deciding}} not <b>to</b> leave this <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I feel as she does about it, and I intend that he shall." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{was just}} his way. If it didn't suit him <b>to</b> explain a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> he wouldn't do it. You might pump {{at him a}} week, it wouldn't make no difference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I don't suppose any {{one ever}} said such a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> before, did they? I don't approve of lords as an institution. I {{think the world}} has got beyond them--far beyond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is in Venice; {{and you may}} {{be leading}} me on to say <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that will make trouble for my mother and me. You may be a spy"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Elisabeth," [...] he whispered, [...] "I {{feel like}} a traitor. I feel myself moved to say <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> under false pretences. I ought not to have come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert again warned Serviss {{from taking}} this {{outburst}} too seriously. [...] "She is possessed, doctor. Some bad spirit is influencing {{her to say}} these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> She's not herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I hain't. It ain't a {{question}} of management. It's {{a question}} of buying and selling. I offer the <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> first. I reckon Fulkerson couldn't get on very well without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{thousand}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>you,</b> my love; {{and you have}} ten thousand <b>things</b> <b>to</b> tell me.--Do <b>you</b> mean that second surprise which I told you of in my letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Only {{yesterday}} I heard Mademoiselle Potin {{doing that}} very same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> [...] "It {{is that you do}} not care, Master Steve. It is that you do not care. You do not want to care.") ...|$|R
6000|$|Carmen {{studied him}} thoughtfully. [...] "You {{generally}} take the proper line; sometimes I think you're cleverer than you look. Anyway, one isn't forced to explain <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Explaining what one wants is always annoying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} a good impression, and that man's {{favorable}} opinion may mean great <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I shouldn't wonder if you cashed a good many big pay drafts before we have finished with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} I {{may be able}} to present <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in an aspect so altered," [...] said Lopez as he {{prepared}} to take his leave, [...] "as to make you change your mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I'd better {{not leave the}} whole <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Jeff," [...] Westover said, after a moment's reflection. [...] "I don't see exactly how I could bring the {{question}} into a first interview." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what harm {{has been}} done you? From what you {{yourself}} have told me, I know that Miss Crawley has said the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that she has said <b>to</b> your father. <b>You</b> can't but admire her for the feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{absolutely}} topping of you, old man!" [...] he said. [...] "Then I'll {{leave the}} whole <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Write me {{the moment you}} have done anything, won't you? Good-by, old top, and thanks ever so much!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] he replied, [...] "that's settled. Miss Ottway {{will explain}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and tell you}} about my peculiarities. And when she goes you can take her desk, by the window nearest my door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{very sorry}} I said such horrid <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> just now. I {{have been talking}} to Mr Mifflin, and I want to say I think it was ever so nice and {{thoughtful}} of you. I understand everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is for no because,--for {{no cause}} except that simple one which should make any girl refuse any man whom {{she did not}} love. Mr. Finn, I could say {{pleasant}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on any other subject than this,--because I like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On what grounds, Mr. Fitzgerald!" [...] she said, repeating his question; [...] "surely I need hardly tell you. Did not my son say {{the same}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> yesterday, as he walked with you down the avenue?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{dig into}} this." [...] He shoved his pouch into McPherson's shaking hands. [...] "You'd better shed your coat. Here! I'll help you. And private, Tommy, if you don't act the man, I won't do a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, godmother, I {{am afraid}} I must be selfish next, and get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> set me {{right in the}} back and the legs. It's a little <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with your power, godmother, but it's a great deal to poor weak aching me.' ...|$|R
