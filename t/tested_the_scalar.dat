40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect {{in two of}} its forms, i. e., its electric form and its gravitational form. The standard form of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons) move in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials. When a particle is recombined with itself, {{it will have a}} different phase, which can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with itself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has quasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter fringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the electric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB effect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell, and potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> AB effect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region but subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system will not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB experiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a spatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal interference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are non-classical. We present two versions of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal interferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical shell with a time-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the atomic spectrum acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical shell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally varying with time. The former leads to a time-varying internal magnetic field, and the latter leads to a time-varying gravitational redshift. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The {{volume integral}} equations are discretized and {{converted into a}} system of linear equations using the method of moments. The system of equations for the JM-formulation is solved using the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) and multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is also applied. Whereas the AVFU-formulation is still under development and GMRES and MLFMA are not implemented; thereby limiting the problem domain that can be analysed. Numerical results are compared to existing model problems solved using either the volume integral equations for the fields, i. e. the EH-formulation, flux densities, i. e. the DB-formulation or the Mie series solutions. The scattering cross-section of simple scatterers like an isotropic sphere to complex scatterers like double negative chiral and metamaterial spheres is investigated.

In <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> case and in the Lorenz gauge in the electromagnetic and gravitational cases, the retarded integral over the infinite past of the source does not converge as a distribution, so we cut off the null source suitably at a finite time t_ 0 and then consider two different limits: (i) the limit as the observation point goes to null infinity at fixed t_ 0, from which the " 1 /r" part of the fields can be extracted and (ii) the limit t_ 0 → - ∞ at fixed "observation point. " The limit (i) {{gives rise to a}} "velocity kick" on distant <b>test</b> particles in <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> and electromagnetic cases, and it gives rise to a "memory effect" (i. e., a permanent change in relative separation of two <b>test</b> particles) in <b>the</b> linearized gravitational case, in agreement with previous analyses.

This strongly suggests that the memory effect [...] -including nonlinear memory effect of Christodoulou [...] -should not be interpreted as arising simply from the passage of (effective) null stress energy to null infinity but rather as arising from a "burst of radiation" associated with the creation of the null stress-energy (as in case (i) above) or, more generally, with radiation present in the spacetime that was not "produced" by the null stress-energy.

40|$|Nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{leaching}} from agriculture {{has become}} an increasigly important issue in New Zealand. There {{has been an increase}} in NO₃⁻ leaching in recent years, with the cause of this mainly due to increases in cattle numbers and the application of N fertilisers. NO₃⁻ leaching is of importance due to its economic cost to farmers, environmental impact and potential health risk. Economic cost to the farmers occurs when leached nitrogen (N) has to be replaced with fertiliser N. There is also a major environmental concern about eutrophication. Eutrophication causes an increase in algae and aquatic life and reduces the recreational value of waterways. Winter forage grazing systems leach disproportitally high amounts of N, compared {{with the rest of the}} farming system. There are very few measurements of nitrate leaching losses from below winter grazed fodder beet (FB) in New Zealand. Measurements are needed urgently to quantify and ultimately minimise NO₃⁻ losses from these systems. The current systems of measuring NO₃⁻ leaching suffer from limitations such as being labour intensive, the inability to measure nitrate leaching under cultivation and the need to scale up results from small plots or lysimeters. The objective of this research project was to develop a new system of measuring N leaching that could accurately quantify N leaching under a winter grazed FB crop without the limitations of current systems. The suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system was developed to overcome these limitations. This was done through having a single collection/retrieval site, changing the depth of the top of the suction cup shaft to below the level of cultivation in soil, increasing the number of suction cups per unit area and having a large measurement area (0. 16 ha). <b>The</b> <b>SCALAR</b> system was developed and tested in this research project. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>SCALAR</b> system successfully overcome the limitations of previous measurement systems. The results of this study showed the total N leaching under the winter grazed FB crop was 106. 9 kg N/ha. Of this, 101. 5 kg N/ha was leached in the form of NO₃⁻ and 5. 4 kg N/ha was leached in the form of ammonium (NH₄⁺). However, these values are likely to have been affected by <b>the</b> development and <b>testing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>SCALAR</b> system and are therefore not considered to be representative of a typical winter grazed FB crop.

This {{is done by}} extending, from space to superspace, Weinberg's perturbative approach to quantum field theory. Superfields work just as a device that allow one to write super Poincare-covariant superamplitudes for interacting theories, relying neither in path integral nor canonical formulations. Explicit transformation laws for particle states under finite supersymmetric transformations are offered. C, P, T, and R transformations are also worked out. A key feature of this formalism {{is that it does}} not require the introduction of auxiliary fields, and when introduced, their purpose is just to render supersymmetric invariant the time-ordered products in the Dyson series. <b>The</b> formalism is <b>tested</b> for <b>the</b> cubic <b>scalar</b> superpotential. It is found that when a superparticle is its own antisuperparticle the lowest-order correction of time-ordered products, together with its covariant part, corresponds to the Wess-Zumino model potential.

40|$|Interfacial mass {{transfer}} of low-diffusive substances in an unsteady flow environment {{is marked by}} a very thin boundary layer at the interface and other regions with steep concentration gradients. A numerical scheme capable of resolving accurately most details of this process is presented. In this scheme, the fourth-order accurate WENO method developed by Liu et al. (1994) was implemented on a non-uniform staggered mesh to discretize <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> convection while for <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> diffusion a fourth-order accurate central discretization was employed. The discretiza-tion of <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> convection-diffusion equation was combined with a fourth-order Navier-Stokes solver which solves the incompressible flow. A dual meshing strategy was employed, in which <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> was solved on a finer mesh than the incompressible flow. <b>The</b> solver was <b>tested</b> by performing a number of two-dimensional simulations of an unstably stratified flow with low diffusivity <b>scalar</b> transport. <b>The</b> unstable stratification led to buoyant convection which was modelled using a Boussinesq approximation with a linear relationship between flow temperature and density. The or-der of accuracy for one-dimensional scalar transport on a stretched and uniform grid was also <b>tested.</b> <b>The</b> results show that for the method presented above a relatively coarse mesh is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid flow, while the use of a refined mesh for <b>the</b> low-diffusive <b>scalars</b> is found to be beneficial in order to obtain a highly accurate resolution with negligible numerical diffusion.
