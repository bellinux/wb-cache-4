5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign {{the king}} ceased to borrow from <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and instead turned to an {{aggressive}} campaign of tallage taxation and fines. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under RichardI. After the massacre of the York community, in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community,</b> imprisoning the wealthier members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid. During the Baron's War of 1215–17, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. HenryIII restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> became poorer {{towards the end of}} the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being largely replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> in 1806.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> in England {{continued}} to provide essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise {{banned by the}} usury laws, and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority. By {{the time of the}} Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in England throughout much of the period. The first Jews arrived in England in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when William the Conqueror brought over wealthy members of the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> expanded out across England and provided essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws. During the 12th century, the Jewish financial community grew richer still, operating under royal protection and providing the king with a source of ready credit. All major towns had Jewish centres, and even the smaller towns saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants. Towards the end of Henry II's reign, however, the king ceased to borrow from <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and instead turned to extracting money from them through arbitrary taxation and fines. The Jews became vilified and accusations were made that they conducted ritual child murder, encouraging the pogroms carried out against Jewish communities in the reign of Richard I. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and, with the breakdown in order in 1215, the Jews were subject to fresh attacks. HenryIII restored some protection and Jewish money-lending began to recover. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> became increasingly impoverished and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community,</b> Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
