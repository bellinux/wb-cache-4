25|$|An Irish Convention {{of around}} one hundred delegates sat from July {{and ended in}} March 1918. Up until December 1917 Redmond used his {{influence}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> which had been put forward by the Southern Unionist leader Lord Midleton, accepted. It foresaw All-Ireland Home Rule with partial fiscal autonomy (until after the war, without customs and excise). All sides, including most Ulster delegates, wavered towards favouring agreement. Already ailing while attending the Convention, his health permanently affected by an accident in 1912, Redmond also suffered assault {{on the street in}} Dublin by a crowd of young Sinn Féin supporters {{on his way to the}} Convention, which included C.S. 'Todd' Andrews. On 15 January, just when he intended to move a motion on his proposal to have the Midleton plan agreed, some nationalist colleagues—the prominent Catholic Bishop O'Donnell and MP Joseph Devlin—expressed doubts. Rather than split the nationalist side, he withdrew his motion. A vital chance was lost.|$|E

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat came up {{with the}} concept for [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] when he was {{thinking}} of the worst possible situations to be in with the Weeping Angels and thought of the inability to see. His first idea was blindness, though this developed into the situation that Amy ends up in. Moffat designed the two-part story to be a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he wrote for the third series that introduced the Weeping Angels. He was inspired by the relationship between the film Alien and its sequel, Aliens, which he referred to as [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever", describing it as being more [...] "highly coloured" [...] as opposed to Alien more low-key tone. He also intended for the Angels <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> that could become [...] "almost like a war", in contrast to the way they were struggling to survive in [...] "Blink". The title [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] was suggested by Moffat's son.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by lead writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat. He designed the two-part episode as a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he had written for the third series. He compared the relationship to the film Alien and its sequel Aliens, with the former being more low-key and the latter more [...] "highly coloured". Moffat thought that Aliens was [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever" [...] and decided {{to use it as}} a model. He also intended to portray the Angels and their actions differently; in [...] "Blink" [...] they were barely surviving and resembled scavengers, while in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] he wanted them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> that could become [...] "almost like a war". The two-part story was intended to show the worst possible instance that could occur with the Weeping Angels, which was the inability to see, as explored in the second part, [...] "Flesh and Stone", when Amy must keep her eyes closed. Executive producer Piers Wenger thought that the Delirium Archive, the museum the Doctor and Amy visited at the beginning of the episode, needed to be explained, therefore Moffat named it [...] "the final resting place of the Headless Monks" [...] and sent it to him via text message. The Headless Monks themselves appeared in the mid-series finale of the next series, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
2500|$|Disaster {{recovery}} (DR) {{and business}} continuity {{refers to an}} organization’s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected event and resume operations. Organizations often have a plan in place (usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "Disaster Recovery Plan" [...] or [...] "Business Continuity Plan") that outlines how a recovery will be accomplished. The key to successful disaster recovery is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> (emergency plan, disaster recovery plan, continuity plan) well before disaster ever strikes. Often used together, the terms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are very different. Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, where as Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and data-centric functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{world is}} {{changing}} rapidly and the uncertainty that characterizes today´s society makes companies {{preparations for the}} future crucial. Purpose: To examine how CEO:s in small companies look at the future {{and what kind of}} preparations they make in order to meet it.
