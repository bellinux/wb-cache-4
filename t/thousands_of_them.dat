5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, hundreds of thousands of Polish soldiers became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the Katyn massacre. Out of Anders' 80,000 evacuees from Soviet Union gathered in the United Kingdom only 310 volunteered to return to Poland in 1947.|$|E

The interface between remote concentrators and telephone switches has been standardised by ETSI as the V5 protocol.

When the city was subsequently threatened by Irish Catholic forces, the Catholic Dubliners were expelled from the city by its English garrison. In the 1640s, the city was besieged twice during the Irish Confederate Wars, in 1646 and 1649. However, on both occasions the attackers were driven off before a lengthy siege could develop.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its time}} Kabul was {{independent}} until it {{became part of the}} Durrani Empire in 1747. During the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, the British army invaded the area but withdrew in 1842, although <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were killed during a surprise ambush on their way to Jalalabad. In retaliation another British force partly burned Kabul before retreating back to British India. The British again occupied the city during the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879, after their resident staff were massacred there, but withdrew about a year later when they installed Emir.|$|E

25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} in Sicily swung {{in favor of}} Carthage in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle {{off the coast of}} Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Dionysius then launched a counterattack by land and sea, and the Syracusans surprised the enemy fleet while most of the crews were ashore, destroying all the Carthaginian ships. At the same time, Dionysius's ground forces stormed the besiegers' lines and routed the Carthaginians. Himilco and his chief officers abandoned their army and fled Sicily. Himilco returned to Carthage in disgrace and was very badly received; he eventually committed suicide by starving himself.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{were fairly}} good years for Colt, but the coming-end of the Cold War would change all that. Colt had long left {{innovation}} in civilian firearms to their competitors, {{feeling that the}} handgun business could survive on their traditional revolver and M1911 designs. Instead, Colt focused on the military market, where they held the primary contracts for production of rifles for the US military. This strategy dramatically failed for Colt {{through a series of}} events in the 1980s. In 1984, the U.S. military standardized on the Beretta 92F. This was not much of a loss for Colt's current business, as M1911A1 production had stopped in 1945. Meanwhile, the military rifle business was growing because the U.S. military had a major demand for more upgraded M16s; the M16A2 model had just been adopted and the Military needed hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In July 1944 Rajs {{took part}} in Operation Ostra Brama against the German {{occupation}} of Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania). He was awarded Order Virtuti Militari for his heroism. During the Red Army advance into occupied Poland his commanding officer was arrested by the NKVD. Rajs took over the command of his battalion, and led them out to safety {{in the area of}} Puszcza Rudnicka forest. Under the Soviet military control the AK partisans were routinely disarmed. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were arrested and sent to the Soviet Gulag. In October 1944 Rajs travelled to Białystok and under an assumed identity, joined the Związek Patriotów Polskich, controlled and directed from Moscow. From January 1945 he led the LWP platoon in the State Forest Defence Battalion near Hajnówka. In May 1945 he contacted the AK Major Zygmunt Szendzielarz – an avid anti-communist – who was recreating the already disassembled 5th Wilno Bridage of Armia Krajowa in order to oppose the Soviet occupation of Białystok. Rajs joined Szendzielarz with 29 soldiers under his command, and on 9 May 1945 became the leader of the 2nd Squadron in the 5th Brigade of AK.|$|E
25|$|After {{the sack}} of Bhatner fort during the Timurid conquests of India in 1398, Timur {{attacked}} and sacked the important cities like Sirsa, Fatehabad, Sunam, Kaithal and Panipat. When he reached {{near the town}} of Sarsuti from the fort of Firozah and Bhatner, the residents who were mostly non-Muslims fled and were chased by a detachment of Timur's troops, with <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being killed as well as looted by the troops. From there he traveled to Fatehabad, whose residents fled and a large number of those remaining in the town were massacred. The Ahirs resisted him at Ahruni but were defeated, with thousands being killed and many were taken prisoners while the town was burnt to ashes. From there he traveled to Tohana. Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi said the inhabitants of that town were robbers. They tried to resist but were defeated and fled. Timur's army pursued and killed 200 Jats, while taking many more as prisoners. He then sent a detachment to chase the fleeing Jats and killed 2,000 of them. Meanwhile, their wives and children were enslaved and their property plundered. From there he proceeded to Kaithal; the residents were massacred and plundered and all the villages along the way were destroyed. On the next day, he reached Assandh which was deserted. Afterward, he subdued Tughlaqpur's fort and the town of Salwan before besieging Loni's fort and ultimately marching on Delhi.|$|E

500|$|The {{clearance}} {{was described}} by witnesses as being brutal and sudden. Clouds of tear gas covered the area, and volleys of birdshot were fired on those who refused to withdraw. Medics, ambulances and a journalist were reportedly attacked as well. Sporadic clashes broke out around Bahrain hours after the raid. During the afternoon the National Guard and army deployed armoured vehicles, tanks, more than 50armoured personnel carriers and set up checkpoints in the streets around the country.

500|$|Himmler {{ordered the}} {{evacuation}} of all camps in January 1945, charging camp commanders with [...] "making sure that not a single prisoner from the concentration camps falls alive {{into the hands of}} the enemy." [...] On 17 January, 56,000–58,000 Auschwitz detainees, of whom two-thirds were Jews, were evacuated under guard, largely on foot, in severe winter conditions. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> died in the subsequent death march west towards Wodzisław Śląski. The guards shot all prisoners who were unable to march at the imposed pace. Peter Longerich estimates that a quarter of the detainees were thus killed. A column of inmates reached Gross-Rosen concentration camp complex. Throughout February, the terribly overcrowded main camp at Gross-Rosen was cleared, and all 44,000 inmates were moved further west. An unknown number died in this last journey. In March 1945, Himmler ordered that no more prisoners should be killed, as he hoped to use them as hostages in negotiations with the Allies. Approximately 20,000 Auschwitz prisoners made it to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where they were liberated by the British in April 1945.|$|E
