5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of <b>the</b> <b>statute,</b> and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object.

As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of <b>the</b> <b>statute.</b> The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

The new law prescribed a copyright term of 14 years, with a provision for renewal for a similar term, during which only the author and the printers they chose to license their works to could publish the author's creations.
