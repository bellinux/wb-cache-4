5|$|In 2007 Pistorius applied <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> non-disabled track meets. He was {{at first}} accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
