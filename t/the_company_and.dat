5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin.

5|$|Arbitration between <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>and</b> its {{employees}} by the Indiana Public Service Commission {{resulted in a}} decision mostly favoring the company.

5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>and</b> Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was {{able to have the}} government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> <b>and</b> permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>and</b> its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>and</b> reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E
