Both groups used the same hand <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b> One group was composed of 41 conventionally trained Air Force 5 -and 7 -level technicians who normally maintain such equipment as part of their jobs. The technicians used the same troubleshooting techniques they ordinarily used on their jobs, and they were provided with a performance aid resembling an AQ Force technical order. The other group was composed of 20 high-school students with no prior training or experience in electronics.

Using the proceduralized troubleshooting aid, the high-school students took significantly less troubleshooting time than did the experienced technicians using normal techniques: however, the technicians required significantly less repair time and made signifcantly fewer errors than did the students. These dgferences may be accounted for in part by differences in the tasks and scoring methods for the two groups, and there were no differences between the two groups on a number of other measures. However, the difference in training timeand. therefore, cost of training between the two groups was so great as to suggest the possibility that job-relevant training and proceduralization of the task can introduce substantfa! savings, even after the cost of developing the special performance aids required by proceduralized troubleshooting is sub traded...|$|E

40|$|Passive components, {{primarily}} resistors and capacitors, make up {{the majority}} of components for electronic circuits. Cost and performance are critical factors while size becomes important in hand held devices. Integrated passive components promise breakthroughs in performance, size, and eventually cost However, poor economic and business conditions have hampered the infrastructure development needed for widespread deployment of integrated passive components. This economic weakness has also made designers more risk evasive in the evaluation of new technologies. The 2002 NEMI Roadmap finds that performance is the main driver for embedded passives while the lack of design and simulation <b>tools,</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> is the primary hindrance to the technology development. In spite of the problems, embedded passive component implementation has been accomplished by manufacturers who have internally developed design tools to circumvent the infrastructure weakness. The NEMI Roadmap has established new metrics to quantify and compare space savings for comparing discrete passives with integrated passive alternatives. New cost models have allowed us to evaluate the alternative passive component technologies. The space savings, component count savings, board size savings, and conversion cost savings are weighed against higher materials costs. The technical needs and infrastructure needs are spelled out for thin core laminates, ceramic loaded pastes, plated resistors, thin film resistor foils and polymer thick film resistors.
