5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> is one third of the length of <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> before it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian coordinate system) is called <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> and the ray from <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> in the reference direction is the polar axis.

5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> star indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E

Pearson raced in two more Busch races that season (Dover, North Carolina), starting second and first; he finished fifth and first. The North Carolina win was his only Busch victory.|$|E
5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911.

5|$|The chasms {{that open}} {{throughout}} {{the sea in}} the final moments of the book derive from the Hollow Earth theory.

5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session for}} the United States Grand Prix {{was held on}} June 18. Jarno Trulli gained <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> position by posting the fastest lap time, 1:10.625.

The rest of the top 10 consisted of Rubens Barrichello, Takuma Sato, Mark Webber, and Felipe Massa.|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> of L1 in C1 lies on R, <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong {{katabatic}} winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate.

5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
