Damodar influences all the witnesses including Shekhar before Shankar could arrest him. He later comes to know that Raja Rao's son Bharath, the previous district collector committed suicide along with his wife, who was a friend of Prakash, because of defamation and personal attacks when Bharath tried to stop the power project.|$|E
5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's objections to the operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion had to go <b>through</b> <b>him.</b> Browning concluded that to be effective, the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.|$|E

Briggs, {{the chairman of the}} NDRC's S-1 Uranium Committee, who supplied copies of American studies. On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through Lord Melchett for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research. This payment was made by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) through a Canadian subsidiary. It had the desired side effect of impressing the Canadian authorities with the importance of Laurence's work.|$|E

5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go <b>through</b> <b>him</b> for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and <b>through</b> <b>him</b> Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|Mooppanar, {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} based in Thanjavur, had purchased a Williamson 35 mm {{camera and a}} printer in England. R. Nataraja Mudaliar, then an automobile dealer in Madras, bought the equipment from him at a price of less than 2,000. Nataraja Mudaliar developed a passion for moving pictures after watching the films of Dadasaheb Phalke. During the administration of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, cinematographers from Britain were filming a documentary on him. Nataraja Mudaliar met Stewart Smith, one of the cinematographers {{who worked in the}} documentary, and learned about the basics of photography in film-making <b>through</b> <b>him.</b> This eventually led to Nataraja Mudaliar establishing his production house, India Film Company. He brought together some of his business associates, who invested in the production house, and established South India's first film studio in 1915 on Miller's Road, Purasawalkam, Madras.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass <b>through</b> <b>him</b> for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: <b>through</b> <b>him,</b> {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E

On the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, Cage reiterated his statement from Genesis, which angered Brown in the storyline. Brown said that Cage {{would have to go}} <b>through</b> <b>him</b> {{in order to get a}} title shot before the segment resulted in a fight between the two. Cage requested the match against Brown from NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko on the November26, 2005 episode of Impact!, which he was granted.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless <b>through</b> <b>Him.</b> For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow <b>through</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in Hammersmith, West London. He was the oldest of two sons born to Ethel May Hollamby, née Kingdom (1899/1900–1966), and Edward Thomas Hollamby (1893–1978), a police constable. His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts during the 1930s. At the college, he {{was inspired by the}} Arts and Crafts aesthetic propounded by one of his lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and <b>through</b> <b>him</b> came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of the Arts and Crafts movement {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go <b>through</b> <b>him</b> and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav's {{subsequent}} campaign greatly {{exceeded the}} expectations of the Byzantines, who had regarded him only as a means to exert diplomatic pressure on the Bulgarians. The Rus' prince conquered the core regions of the Bulgarian state in the northeastern Balkans in 967–969, seized the Bulgarian tsar Boris II, and effectively ruled the country <b>through</b> <b>him.</b> Sviatoslav intended to continue his drive south against Byzantium itself, which in turn regarded the establishment of a new and powerful Russo-Bulgarian state in the Balkans with great concern. After stopping a Rus' advance through Thrace at the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 970, the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes led an army north into Bulgaria in 971 and captured Preslav, the capital. After a three-month siege of the fortress of Dorostolon, Sviatoslav agreed to terms with the Byzantines and withdrew from Bulgaria. Tzimiskes formally annexed Eastern Bulgaria to the Byzantine Empire. However, most of the country in the central and western Balkans remained in effect outside imperial control; this would lead to the revival of the Bulgarian state in these regions under the Cometopuli dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims <b>through</b> <b>him,</b> with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E
