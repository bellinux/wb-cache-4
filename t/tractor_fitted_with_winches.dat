50|$|A few {{transporters}} {{have been}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>winches</b> for loading, {{but this is}} uncommon. More usually a disabled vehicle is loaded {{with the assistance of}} a recovery tractor, either winching or pushing it on board.|$|R
5000|$|The company's best-known {{product was}} the Drott 4 in 1 bucket. This was a tractor {{attachment}} with four functions: dozer, clamshell, bucket and scraper. The [...] "International Drott" [...] was an International Harvester <b>tractor</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> Drott equipment.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of vehicle identifications {{separated}} by a slash, the first number refers to a vehicle not <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a <b>winch,</b> and the second to a vehicle <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a <b>winch.</b> Numbers separated by a comma indicate similar models but with different secondary details.|$|R
50|$|A backhoe loader, {{also called}} a loader backhoe, digger in layman's terms, or colloquially {{shortened}} to backhoe within the industry, {{is a heavy}} equipment vehicle that consists of a <b>tractor</b> like unit <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a loader-style shovel/bucket {{on the front and}} a backhoe on the back. Due to its (relatively) small size and versatility, backhoe loaders are very common in urban engineering and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural <b>tractor</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a front loader and rear backhoe attachment.|$|R
50|$|In 1905, a Hornsby 20-hp 17-ton <b>tractor</b> was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a chain track. In July 1905 and February 1906, it was {{demonstrated}} at Grantham to {{representatives from the}} War Office. In August 1906, the 1903 competition-winning <b>tractor</b> was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> chain tracks. On testing this vehicle in July 1907, the word caterpillar was first {{used to describe the}} machine (by British soldiers). In May 1908, this vehicle {{was demonstrated}} to King Edward VII and the Prince of Wales at Aldershot, who were introduced to David Roberts.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually Bottrill, in {{association}} with A. H. MacDonald & Co. of Richmond Melbourne, began producing steam and oil-based <b>tractors</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> his wheels. The most famous was known as [...] "Big Lizzie" [...] built in 1915 with a wheel diameter of 7 feet 2 inches (2.2m). At 34 feet (10.4m) long and 45 tons (46 tonnes); with two dreadnought wheeled trailers, it was capable of carrying a total of 80 tons (81 Tonnes) and effectively making its own roads.|$|R
50|$|Many Second World War half-tracks {{were sold}} off to {{civilian}} users either as surplus stock or later due to obsolescence when the fully tracked armoured personnel carrier was introduced into service. Most {{were used in}} engineering-related tasks involving terrain that {{would be difficult for}} even four-wheel drive trucks, such as snow, sand and water-logged soil. Many were significantly modified for their new roles, including being <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>winches,</b> small cranes, and generators after the rear cabin sides were removed.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} model was a modified Yorkshire steam <b>tractor,</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> jacks {{at the front}} to allow a separate bogie to be manoeuvred into position underneath the front axle to guide it on the rails. Without the bogie, the vehicle could still be driven on ordinary roads and {{had the advantage of}} being able to be detached and run around the train, without requiring special loops for that purpose. For reversing on the track, as when shunting, the rear wheels were modified to be steerable.|$|R
50|$|AHTS vessels {{differ from}} Platform supply vessels (PSVs) in being <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>winches</b> for towing and anchor handling, having an open stern {{to allow the}} decking of anchors, and having more power to {{increase}} the bollard pull. The machinery is specifically designed for anchor handling operations. They also have arrangements for quick anchor release, which is operable from the bridge or other normally manned location in direct communication with the bridge. The reference load used {{in the design and}} testing of the towing winch is twice the static bollard pull.|$|R
50|$|Her design took {{advantage}} of a loophole in the Seawanhaka '90-foot' rating rule, to produce a racing yacht with long overhangs at each end, so that when heeled over, her waterline length (and therefore her speed) increased dramatically (see image at left).To save weight, she was completely unfinished below deck, with exposed frames. She was the first racing boat to be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>winches</b> below decks, {{in an era when}} her competitors relied on sheer man-power. Despite this she carried a crew of 64 for racing due to her large sail plan.|$|R
50|$|The yacht Reliance, American {{defender of}} the 1903 America's Cup, was the first racing boat to be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> modern <b>winches</b> below decks, {{in an era when}} her {{competitors}} relied on pulley systems (block and tackle).|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "bulldozer" [...] {{correctly}} refers {{only to a}} <b>tractor</b> (usually tracked) <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a dozer blade.|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} farm <b>tractor</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> two sets of tires with high lugs and another set of tires with tallow lugs in straw without tillage (corn straw). The travel speeds used were approximately 4, 5, 6 and 7 km h(- 1) and a constant pulling force of 25 kN was fixed. Tractor traction, forward speed, slip and consumption of fuel were measured and drawbar power, the ratio between the consumption and power and traction coefficient were calculated. It was observed that the tractor performance was similar to high and low lug tire conditions, in an area covered with corn straw...|$|R
50|$|Unusually, the <b>tractor</b> {{unit was}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> both an armored cab and two <b>winches</b> <b>with</b> a {{combined}} pull of 60 tons. The intention was {{that as well}} as hauling the tank transporter semi-trailer, the tractor unit could itself be used for battlefield light recovery work.|$|R
50|$|The second {{prototype}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a propeller-driven <b>winch</b> {{to haul in}} drogue cable after air-to-air firing sorties. This {{was first}} flown on 26 May 1938.|$|R
50|$|Among the company's {{products}} was the 'Pony MÃ©canique', {{developed by}} the Napier motor company and improved in design by Oliver Danson North. It was a three-wheeled articulated <b>tractor</b> unit <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> automatic coupling gear to enable rapid change of trailers. These vehicles were built under licence from UK company Scammell, from 1937 to 1970.|$|R
50|$|Only {{a handful}} of {{manufacturers}} produce dedicated ballast tractors. Extra-heavy-duty chassis versions of mass-production <b>tractor</b> units are <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> drawbar hitches and a separate ballast box as an alternative.|$|R
50|$|FMTV {{is built}} around a {{conventional}} bolted/huck-bolted cold-formed C-section chassis with bolted-in tubular cross-members. The high-grade 758 MPa steel used is sourced from Sweden. LMTV variants can be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a DP-10J <b>winch</b> <b>with</b> a 4,990 kg line pull. MTV variants use a DP-515 <b>winch</b> <b>with</b> a 7,031 kg line pull.|$|R
50|$|The prototypes were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> both 'General Service' canvas-covered rear bodies {{or with a}} steel/fibreglass box body. Some Llamas were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a {{mechanical}} <b>winch</b> driven from the gearbox, which could be fed through the front or rear chassis cross-members for vehicle recovery.|$|R
5000|$|IH {{produced}} {{a range of}} large gasoline-powered farm tractors under the Mogul and Titan brands. Sold by McCormick dealers, the Type C Mogul {{was little more than}} a stationary engine on a <b>tractor</b> chassis, <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> friction drive (one speed forward, one reverse). [...] Between 1911 and 1914, 862 Moguls were built. These tractors had varied success, but the trend going into the mid-1910s was [...] "small" [...] and [...] "cheap".|$|R
50|$|The 970 {{dump truck}} {{was built on}} the {{standard}} G509 chassis. The spare tires were mounted between the cab and bed. The tailgate could be opened at the top or bottom. Originally the dump trucks were not <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> front <b>winches</b> in order to reduce front axle loading. After a Corps of Engineers request, winches were fitted from June 1944 onwards. The trucks had air brakes and trailer brake controls.|$|R
50|$|In {{vehicles}} such as {{tractors and}} trucks, the tachometer often has other markings, usually a green arc showing the speed range {{in which the}} engine produces maximum torque, which is of prime interest to operators of such vehicles. <b>Tractors</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a power take off (PTO) system have tachometers showing the engine speed needed to rotate the PTO at the standardized speed required by most PTO-driven implements. In many countries, tractors are required to have a speedometer for use on a road. To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle's tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed. This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient. Tractors with multiple 'road gears' often have tachometers {{with more than one}} speed scale. Aircraft tachometers have a green arc showing the engine's designed cruising speed range.|$|R
5000|$|High-tip buckets are {{suitable}} for light materials such as chip, peat and light gravel and when the bucket is emptied from a height.Unlike backhoes or standard <b>tractors</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a front bucket, many large loaders do not use automotive steering mechanisms. Instead, they steer by a hydraulically actuated pivot point set exactly between {{the front and rear}} axles. This is referred to as [...] "articulated steering" [...] and allows the front axle to be solid, allowing it to carry greater weight. Articulated steering provides better maneuverability for a given wheelbase. Since the front wheels and attachment rotate on the same axis, the operator is able to [...] "steer" [...] his load in an arc after positioning the machine, which can be useful. The tradeoff is that when the machine is [...] "twisted" [...] to one side and a heavy load is lifted high, it has a greater risk of turning over to the [...] "wide" [...] side.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, {{with over}} 7,700 units {{eventually}} sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor {{is the only}} one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker, Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the Royal Air Force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>winches.</b> In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. Dorman diesel and a five speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.|$|R
5000|$|The American company Hy-Dynamic, a {{division}} of Bucyrus-Erie, introduced the second purpose-built American-made backhoe loader in 1959, the Dynahoe Model A. It offered a 14,000 lb. operating weight, 14-foot dig depth, and was powered by either a 65 hp Continental flat-head [...] "Red Seal" [...] 6-cylinder gasoline engine, or starting in 1961, a Detroit Diesel 353 diesel engine. The gasoline engine was phased out in 1964, with only diesel-powered units produced from that point on. The company marketed the Dynahoe as the only purpose-built backhoe-loader; previously all American backhoes were merely farm <b>tractors</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> front loader and rear backhoe attachments. The Dynahoe was built very robustly {{from the ground up}} with heavy excavation in mind. Production of the Dynahoe continued into the early 1990s culminating in the model Dynahoe 200-4, with a 36,000 lb. operating weight, 4-wheel drive, and a 20-foot dig depth. Production ceased with demand wavering in favor of more modern and versatile excavator type machines becoming more cost effective, and productive. Many of the original Dynahoe Model A's are still in use to this day.|$|R
