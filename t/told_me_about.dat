(At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
500|$|Peterson's {{most famous}} {{commercials}} were his [...] "Wake up! Wake up!" [...] spots, which began airing in the mid-1970s. Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi, Texas. Said Peterson, [...] "Somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it and I followed it up. Ours {{was much more}} successful than theirs. They didn't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs." [...] Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night. The commercial ran less frequently in the 1980s, and last aired in 1988.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it. I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1956, {{his song}} [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart, and Berry toured {{as one of the}} [...] "Top Acts of '56". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No One" [...] saw the {{reintroduction}} of Richard Dormer and Paul Kaye, who portrayed Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, respectively, in {{the third}} season, last appearing in the episode [...] "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", before returning for the sixth season. Dormer was previously asked about returning to Game of Thrones {{in an interview in}} February 2015, saying {{at the time that he}} was doubtful about coming back to the series, stating [...] "they haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it, so I don't think so." [...] He also noted about his portrayal of the character, [...] "Beric was a noble character, a leader of men. Kind of like Robin Hood. So I thought, that's how I'll play the guy." [...] Paul Kaye's participation in the series was confirmed in mid-April 2016, with his agency posting about the casting shortly before the premiere of the sixth season.|$|E

500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|He is {{mentioned}} numerous times in author Robert Liparulo's thriller Deadlock (2009). Zhou is first featured in chapter eight during {{a conversation between}} the main character John [...] "Hutch" [...] Hutchinson, a journalist bent on stopping the maniacal plans of a billionaire madman, and his friend's young son Dillon, an archery enthusiast. When Hutch asks {{him if he had}} ever heard of the archery-champion-turned-actor Howard Hill, Dillon replies: [...] "I don't think so... You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Zhou Tong". Hutch then says: [...] "Oh, yeah. Zhou Tong was something. Taught the Song Dynasty to be the best military archers in history. But Howard Hill [...] ". Later in chapter fifty, while Hutch is trailing a killer through an airport, a page goes out over the intercom system for a [...] "Mr. Zhou Tong". When the page goes out again, Hutch muses: [...] "Zhou Tong had been a famous archery teacher and military arts tutor in the Song Dynasty. [...] had long telephone conversations about him, because of Tong's blending of archery skills and self-discipline. He was an inspiration to [...] Dillon had sensed that and wanted to known everything about him". He finally realizes that the page had to have been left by Dillon's mother Laura to catch his attention. The page is sent to warn him of a trap, but Hutch receives it too late.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
