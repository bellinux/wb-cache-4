5000|$|As {{there was}} only one man on the {{footplate}} on this branch, the locomotive always faced Newcastle so that the driver could [...] "spot" [...] the cars at the two intermediate short platforms on the Up side. Being worked as a [...] "tram", a porter acted as guard and also sold tickets en route from a portable <b>ticket</b> <b>rack</b> carried with the train and collected all tickets in transit.|$|E
50|$|Typically, half-fare tickets (e.g. for children, dogs, and bicycles) {{would be}} created by cutting the ticket in half vertically, return tickets by having a {{diagonal}} cut across the ticket, having the value of half the adult fare. The remaining part was placed in groove in {{the lid of the}} <b>ticket</b> <b>rack</b> above its tube. It could then be used as another child ticket, or counted as a credit.|$|E
50|$|The {{tickets were}} printed on card cut to 1+7/32 by 2+1/4 in, with a nominal {{thickness}} of 1/32 in. The whole system, from printing to bulk storage to <b>ticket</b> <b>racks,</b> dating and issue, {{was based on}} these measurements. Although there is some small variation nowadays (metricated to 30 x 57 x 0.75 mm for example), {{it is still a}} vital component of the system.|$|R
50|$|On {{election}} day, Barack Obama {{carried the}} state of New York by a landslide margin, winning 63.35% of the vote to Mitt Romney's 35.17%. As in previous elections, the Democratic <b>ticket</b> <b>racked</b> up large margins in the heavily populated New York City area, {{as well as in}} upstate cities like Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and the college town of Ithaca. The Republicans won only in some rural parts of upstate and western New York. New York was one of only six states to swing in President Obama's favor from 2008 to 2012, giving him the largest percentage of the vote for any presidential candidate in the state since 1964 and the second largest Democratic vote share in the state in history.|$|R
