This paper analyzes {{the dynamics of}} the load swing with the rope length as another control channel to the crane system and proposes a control strategy both to suppress the load swing and to control the trolley position. In the control, the rope length is variated to move the load upwards and downwards following to a sinusoidal function so that the swing direction of the load rotates. At the same time, the trolley is controlled to eliminate the oscillation component of the load growing in its <b>travelling</b> <b>direction</b> and to approach to a desired position of the trolley.

40|$|The {{ability to}} plan for the future beyond {{immediate}} needs would be adaptive to many animal species, but is widely thought to be uniquely human. Although studies in captivity have shown that great apes are capable of planning for future needs, it is unknown whether and how they use this ability in the wild. Flanged male Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) emit long calls, which females use to maintain earshot associations with them. We tested whether long calls serve to communicate a male’s ever-changing predominant <b>travel</b> <b>direction</b> to facilitate maintaining these associations. We found that the direction in which a flanged male emits his long calls predicts his subsequent <b>travel</b> <b>direction</b> for many hours, and that a new call indicates a change in his main <b>travel</b> <b>direction.</b> Long calls given at or near the night nest indicate <b>travel</b> <b>direction</b> better than random until late afternoon on the next day. These results show that male orangutans make their travel plans well in advance and announce them to conspecifics. We suggest that such a planning ability is likely to be adaptive for great apes, as well as in other taxa...|$|R

These data have been evaluated using multivariate analysis techniques against historic data on incidents to uncover potential relationships between drivers’ perceptions and incident occurrence. The results show that the participants do not tend to consider system design factors as influential towards incident propagation. However, the analysis shows correlation between the driver responses and historical incident data such as corroboration of the increased incident propagation risks during the engineering works and the possessions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Global {{positioning}} system {{is used to}} get the vehicle position and can be shared with other nodes in the network. The sparse vehicle traffic leads to network fragmentation, is challenging task for safety application. In case of emergency not all the vehicle get affected in network so broadcasting of alert packet is not feasible rather {{it has to be}} multicast, but defining the list of node for multicast is challenging task as every vehicle cannot hold the location information of the entire vehicle in the network. Calculating the list of relative vehicles position is depending on the <b>travelling</b> <b>direction,</b> bearing angle and distance. Road side unit manage all the vehicle information and detect the failure vehicle and calculate detail of the vehicles get affected by the failure vehicle using the geo positioning and multicast alert packet to identified vehicles. This will narrow down broadcasting scenario and prevent the traffic conjunction...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} the orientation behaviour of migrating birds, {{it is important to}} understand when birds set their travel direction. Departure directions of migratory passerines leaving stopover sites are often assumed to reflect the birds' intended travel directions, but this assumption has not been critically tested. We used data from an automated radiotelemetry system and a tracking radar at Falsterbo peninsula, Sweden, to compare the initial orientation of departing songbirds (recorded by radiotelemetry) with the orientation of songbird migrants in climbing and level flight (recorded by radar). We found that the track directions of birds at high altitudes and in level flight were more concentrated than the directions of departing birds and birds in climbing flight, which indicates that the birds adjust their <b>travelling</b> <b>direction</b> once aloft. This was further supported by a wide scatter of vanishing bearings in a subsample of radio-tracked birds that later passed an offshore radio receiver station 50 km southeast of Falsterbo. Track directions seemed to be more affected by winds in climbing compared with level flights, which may be explained by birds not starting to partially compensate for wind drift until they have reached cruising altitudes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the probability of}} fracture in {{a system in which}} a material travels supported by rollers. The moving material is subjected to longitudinal tension for which deterministic and stochastic models are studied. In the stochastic model, the tension is described by a multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The material is assumed to have initial cracks perpendicular to the <b>travelling</b> <b>direction,</b> and a stochastic counting process describes the occurrence of cracks in the longitudinal direction of the material. The material is modelled as isotropic and elastic, and LEFM is applied. For a general counting process, when there is no fluctuation in tension, the reliability of the system can be simulated by applying conditional sampling. With the stochastic tension model, considering fracture of the material leads to a first passage time problem, the solution of which is estimated by simulation. As an example, the probability of fracture is computed for periodically occurring cracks with parameters typical to printing presses and paper material. The numerical results suggest that small cracks are not likely to affect the pressroom runnability. The results also show that tension variations may significantly increase the probability of fracture...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate what the real differences in fuel consumption are between recommended pressure and a pressure 15 percent below the recommendation. Further, the objective is to investigate the precision of air pumps at service stations which represent the equipment motorists use to fill their tires. Together these parts would indicate if it is possible for motorists to keep a recommended pressure in their tires in order to achieve possible fuel savings. The method used is based on field measurements on an existing, public road. Controlled parameters during the measurements included vehicle properties, tire properties, properties of the road stretch used, fuel properties and weather conditions. The results of the measurements showed that the fuel consumption decreased by 2, 7 percent as the pressure was increased from 15 percent below recommendation, to the recommended pressure. These differences were independent of <b>travelling</b> <b>direction</b> (uphill/downhill) and were statistically significant at the 5 percent level according to a T-test. The precision of air pumps at service stations is generally good. Therefore motorists are likely to inflate tires to the intended pressure and benefit from fuel savings...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for high precision coatings on large areas via in-line reactive sputtering, which requires advanced process control techniques. Thus, an improved theoretical understanding of the reactive sputtering process kinetics is mandatory for further technical improvement. We present a detailed Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) gas flow model of an in-line sputtering coater for large area architectural glazing. With this model, the pressure fluctuations caused by a moving substrate are calculated {{in comparison with the}} experiment. The model reveals a significant phase shift in the pressure fluctuations between the areas above the center and the edges of the substrate. This is a geometric effect and is e. g. independent of the substrate <b>travelling</b> <b>direction.</b> Consequently, a long sputtering source will observe pressure fluctuations at its center and edges, which are out of phase. For a heuristic model of the reactive sputtering process, we show that in certain cases a two-dimensional model treatment is sufficient for predicting the film thickness distribution on the moving substrate. In other cases, a strong phase shift between averaged pressure fluctuations and reactive sputtering process response is observed indicating that a three-dimensional model treatment is required for a realistic simulation of the in-line deposition process...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that provides reliable location and time information in all weather and at all times and anywhere {{on or near the}} Earth when and where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is actually a constellation of 27 Earth-orbiting satellites (24 in operation and three extras in case one fails). In VANET, this location information is shared with the Roadside Units and the vehicles to determine accident affected vehicle and to send alert packets to these vehicles. Generally, in VANET, broadcasting scenario can be seen, which is not required as all the vehicles in the network are not affected when emergency event occurs. Instead, multicasting of alert packets is more useful. Therefore, in this paper proposed system is used to design and develop vehicle node having <b>travelling</b> <b>direction</b> and the location information. This node will work as a road side unit and it will manage all vehicles location information and also manage detection of failure node in the network. Once the failure node is detected it will calculate the relative position of other vehicle and multicast the messages to particular vehicle...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} time, tide and water depth on the activity and spatial distribution of estuarine dolphins Sotalia guianensis in Pontal Bay, Ilhéus, Brazil. Direct observations were carried out at four fixed points from January to December of 2006. Estuarine dolphins were sighted in 11 out of 12 months and in 30 % of 181 sampling periods. The average group size, which was 3. 75 ± 1. 59 (n = 64), did not vary significantly by month (Kruskal-Wallis, H = 10. 6729; p = 0. 3836). Infants and adults represented 18 and 82 % of the individuals whose age {{we were able to}} determine, respectively. Estuarine dolphins were more frequently present than expected in areas deeper than 3 m (regression GLM, z = 3. 773; p = 0. 0002).

40|$|Five field {{experiments}} on barley and wheat {{have been carried}} out in North-Eastern Spain on the same field during the cropping seasons 1999 - 00 to 2003 - 04 to compare the effect of different harrowing adjustments on weed control, weed bio-mass and cereal yield. The variables considered were harrowing timing (pre- or early post-emergence), one or two passes, <b>travelling</b> <b>direction,</b> harrowing depth and speed compared with an untreated control and herbicide. Excepting year 2001, with very little weed emergence, mechanical control as a whole caused a significant weed plant reduction compared to the untreated plots in all years. No influence of harrowing depth and travelling speed and of pre-emergence harrowing were found in the trials. A single harrowing treatment conducted across the sowing direction gave the same or less control com-pared to harrowing along the sowing direction. Two harrowing passes achieved a higher efficacy than one single pass and little differences were detected if the second pass was conducted the same day, across the sowing direction or 15 days later. Despite herbicide had generally a higher efficacy than the harrowing treatments, in three out of five years it was found a mechanical control with the same control than herbicide. The effect of the different treatments on weed biomass was lower than on weed number and {{no significant differences were found}} for grain yield. Considering that an herbicide treatment in the present conditions is three times more expensive than harrowing, a single post-emergence harrowing can be conside-red a valid option for low and medium-infested cereal fields...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Modern and {{advanced}} mountain tractor allows four different modes of steering wheels: front wheels, back wheels, four wheels and crab steering. The current paper presents {{the impact of}} different ways of steering to control the slip in the work transverse on the steep hill slope (39. 08 %). Design/methodology/approach: For each mode of steering eight measurements were made; four measurements at a forecasted speed of 0. 69 m/s and four measurements at a speed of 1. 39 m/s. During the two of four measurements the <b>travelling</b> <b>direction</b> was from the left to the right, and vice versa. Findings: The measured slip depended significantly on the steering system, while the driving direction did not cause any differences in the slip. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied only with the similar mountain tractors, which allows four different modes of steering wheels. Additional limitation represents the working polygon and the growing conditions of grass. Practical implications: The crab - steering resulted in the smallest slip (5. 96 %) at the average driving speed of 1. 08 m/s. When steering with all four wheels, the slip at the average speed of 1. 03 m/s increased to 7. 27 %. The biggest slip was measured when steering with only front wheels was applied. In this case the slip was 8. 07 % at the average speed of 1. 01 m/s. Originality/value: The findings from our experiments indicated {{that it is very}} useful to have all wheels steering tractor when working on step slope, because it is grass friendly, offers bigger agility of tractor and improve the safety of the operator...|$|E
