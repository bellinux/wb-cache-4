A suite of biological measurements and {{data were collected from}} these samples. Comparison of age and length distributions between years and areas indicated that while there were no statistical differences between the Maniitsoq and northerly samples in different years, the southerly Nuuk and Paamiut samples were biased to younger age classes. Application of the Gompertz growth model to length and weight at age data indicated an asymptotic length of 154 cm in females and 143 cm in males with weights of 64 kg and 52 kg respectively. A number of correlations were observed between length, midgirth(G 3), body and blubber weights and blubber <b>thickness.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of body condition showed that overall pregnant females were fattest but that blubber thickness was greatest in juveniles. The blubber lipid content was generally 92 - 95 % wet weight of tissue.

For this reason, 110 brain magnetic resonance imaging confirmed ischemic stroke patients and 110 patients age and sex matched controls went through liver ultrasound to detect NAFLD and common carotid ultrasound to measure IMT. Demographic and vascular risk factors were detailed for all subjects. NAFLD was found in 47 (42. 7 %) of ischemic stroke patients and 25 (22. 7 %) of controls. By adjusting sex and age in table 2, odds ratio (OR) for NAFLD was 2. 15 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 25 - 3. 71) that was statistically significant (P = 0. 006). However, after adjusting for other confounding risk factors (waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and ischemic heart disease), the OR decrease to 1. 68 (95 % CI: 0. 42 - 6. 76) that was not statistically significant (P = 0. 460).

This parallel-group, randomized, open label clinical trial enrolled 273 Aboriginal Australians aged ≥ 18 years with periodontitis. Intervention participants received full-mouth periodontal scaling during a single visit, whereas controls received no treatment. Prespecified primary end points measured 12 -month change in carotid intima-media <b>thickness,</b> an <b>indicator</b> of arterial structure, and 3 - and 12 -month change in pulse wave velocity, an indicator of arterial function. ANCOVA used complete case data to evaluate treatment group differences. End points could be calculated for 169 participants with follow-up data at 3 months and 168 participants at 12 months. Intima-media thickness decreased significantly after 12 months in the intervention group (mean reduction=− 0. 023 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, − 0. 038 to − 0. 008] mm) {{but not in the}} control group (mean increase= 0. 002 [95 % CI, − 0. 017 to 0. 022] mm).

Morphometry characteristics such as gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness have been proved to be valuable measurements of brain atrophy. In this study, we proposed a morphometric MRI analysis based method to explore the cross-sectional differences and longitudinal changes of GMV and cortical thickness in patients with AD, (mild cognitive impairment) MCI and the normal elderly. High resolution 3 D MRI data was obtained from ADNI database. SPM 8 plus DARTEL was carried out for data preprocessing. Two kinds of z-score map were calculated to respectively reflect the GMV and cortical thickness decline compared with age-matched normal control database (NCDB). A volume of interest (VOI) covering medial temporal lobe structures was defined by group comparison. Within this VOI, GMV and cortical <b>thickness</b> decline <b>indicators</b> were respectively defined as {{the mean of the}} negative z-scores and the sum of the normalized negative z-scores of the corresponding z-score map. Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to statistically identify group wise differences of the indicators. Support vector machines (SVM) based prediction was performed with a leave-one-out cross-validation design to evaluate the predictive accuracies of the indicators. Linear least squares estimation was utilized to assess the changing rate of the indicators for the three groups. Cross-sectional comparison of the baseline decline indicators revealed that the GMV and cortical thickness decline were more serious from NC, MCI to AD, with statistic significance. Using a multi-region based SVM model with the two indicators, the discrimination accuracy between AD and NC, MCI and NC, AD and MCI was 92. 7 %, 91. 7 %, 78. 4 % respectively.

However, the clinical relevance of these findings is still unknown. This study aims to examine the relationship between serum A-FABP level and carotid intima-media <b>thickness</b> (IMT), an <b>indicator</b> of atherosclerosis in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS - The study cohort included 479 Chinese subjects who underwent carotid IMT measurement. Serum A-FABP levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum A-FABP levels positively correlated with carotid IMT in both men (r= 0. 211, P= 0. 001) and women (r= 0. 435, P< 0. 001). In women, but not in men, the presence of plaques was associated with significantly higher serum A-FABP levels (P< 0. 001 versus women without plaques). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that serum A-FABP level was independently associated with carotid IMT in women (P= 0. 034), together with age and hypertension (both P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS - A-FABP is an independent determinant of carotid atherosclerosis in Chinese women, but not in men. This gender difference may be attributed to the lower serum A-FABP levels in men, and the effect of other risk factors, such as smoking, among our male participants.

40|$|Some {{anthropologists have}} argued that {{communal}} hunts {{played an important role}} in the evolution of hominids. Variation in the frequency and timing of bison hunts on the Great Plains has been explained with the Annual, Vore, and Fat Depletion Models. According to the Annual Model, hunts were organized in the fall to obtain stores of meat for consumption during the winter. The Vore Model refines the Annual Model by proposing that larger and more frequent bison kills occurred during periods with higher precipitation, better grazing conditions, and greater numbers of bison. Different animals may be more intensively butchered and processed to obtain meat from fatter bison, even when many animals were malnourished. Expectations of the Vore and Annual Models are not supported by the analysis of dates, bison remains (dental wear and pathologies, post-cranial cortical <b>thickness),</b> and paleoclimatic <b>indicators</b> recovered from kill-sites throughout the Plains. The proportion and numbers of kill-sites are too low to represent annual events. Almost as many kills occurred in the spring and the fall. Many hunts were accomplished when the bison were in poor health and under diverse grazing and environmental conditions. Instead of being a response to subsistence and environmental problems, many communal hunts served to mediate social and political tensions by providing food and exchangeable items for human aggregations.

To the degree that BMD is a marker of cumulative (endogenous) estrogen exposure, we hypothesized that BMD would be positively associated with cerebral gray and white matter indices. MethodsDual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and magnetic resonance (MRI) scans were acquired in fourteen female patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. BMD was expressed in total BMD (g/cm 2), Z- and T-scores. Cerebral cortical <b>thickness</b> (CT) (as <b>indicator</b> of gray matter status) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (as indicator of white matter integrity) were measured and served as the dependent variables in multilevel random regression models. BMD measures were the independent variables. ResultsFemoral BMD measures were positively associated with CT at trend significance (total BMD: B= 0. 266, 95 % CI: − 0. 019 – 0. 552, p= 0. 067; Z-score: B= 0. 034, 95 % CI: 0. 001 – 0. 067, p= 0. 046; T-score: B= 0. 034, 95 % CI: 0. 000 – 0. 068, p= 0. 052). There were no significant associations between femoral BMD measures and FA. ConclusionsThe data suggest that in women with psychotic disorder, alterations in the neuroprotective effect of estrogen (as measured by BMD) impact cortical gray matter, but not white matter integrity. These findings merit further investigation and, if replicated, would lend support to the estrogen hypothesis of schizophrenia...|$|R

Analysis of body mass markers on the skeletal frame allows for the identification of obesity markers in unknown skeletons and brings into focus the debilitating effects of obesity on the skeletal frame. Drawing from Agostini and Ross' (2011) and Moore's (2009) analyses of obese body mass indicators, this study compared lower extremity CT scans of mesomorphic and obese male patients of African-American and European-American ancestry from the Boston Medical Center. Using the software OsiriX, CT cross-sectional area slices yielded measurements of cortical <b>thickness,</b> an <b>indicator</b> of axial compression, and linear dimensions of the cortical shape, an indicator of bending strength, not possible with external osteometric measurements. Measurements from the pelvis, knee region, and tibia were included as they contribute to the biomechanics of walking (Spyropoulos et al., 1991; Dalstra and Huiskes, 1995) and respond to extra loads from excess adipose tissue (Moore, 2009). Multivariate analysis on a sample of 17 European-Americans and 21 African-Americans measured the effects of BMI and ancestry on the lower extremity. The main effects of BMI correlated with a greater external medial-lateral width of the femoral diaphysis (p less than 0. 05) in obese individuals of both ancestries compared to the mesomorphic groups. The cross sectional anterior-posterior elongation of the mid-diaphyses of the femur (p less than 0. 05) also correlated with BMI, resulting in a greater average mean in the obese groups, which may be attributed to either active lifestyle patterns in this particular obese population or sample size limitations. Main effects associated with ancestry were in the femoral neck, cross sectional area at 35 % femoral diaphyseal length, medial-lateral cross sectional width at 80 % diaphyseal length, femoral epicondylar width, tibial epiphyseal width, and ischial thickness. The results reflect the difference in gait velocity, knee flexion, and cortical bone build-up between the ancestral groups, with the obese gait exacerbating the difference in their femoral shape. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample size and analyzing the biomechanical stress of the obese gait in African-Americans, following Spyropoulos et al. (1991) methods, to isolate the weaker regions of the skeletal frame in both ancestries and address them in weight intervention programs...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical simulation of nonlinear behavior in composite structures by means of the Finite Element method. Thereby special attention is payed to nonlinear material behavior. For this phenomenological material models are developed and presented, which are capable of describing the overall structural response including local effects like delaminations. After the presentation of an anisotropic plasticity model combined with anisotropic hardening the frequently observed and very dangerous type of failure delamination is considered in particular. On the basis of a multilayered, three-dimensional oriented shell theory including higher-order displacement kinematics across the <b>thickness</b> first-ply-failure <b>indicators</b> available from literature are presented at first. They are compared among themselves in particular with respect to their use as yield criterion or damage criterion in a materially nonlinear analysis. In what follows the anisotropic Hoffman failure criterion is used {{in the context of a}} plasticity formulation. Thereby an anisotropic hardening law is included allowing to simulate a nonlinear anisotropic hardening response of the laminate. In order to study the impact of the anisotropic hardening plasticity model structural examples are compared and assessed. For their simulation the progressing delaminations are described in this thesis in a smeared manner and not as a geometrical discontinuity. Due to this continuum mechanics based description it is possible to represent delamination within a thin process layer. Hence four different material models are developed and presented. Some are formulated in the context of a softening plasticity theory while others are formulated in the context of continuum damage mechanics. All models in common is, that they use the critical fracture energy within the description of softening material response. Using those models in combination with a standard continuum mechanics approach leads to the well known problems of mesh sensitivity and loss of ellipticity of the underlying partial differential equations. In order to overcome these problems a mesh adjusted softening modulus is used and moreover a visco-plastic respectively visco-damage regularization is applied where required. In case of the delamination plasticity model the viscosity parameter is adapted automatically with the objective of minimal effect on numerical results. In contrary the delamination damage models utilize a constant viscosity parameter. Both plasticity and some damage models employ the Brewer-Lagace criterion in its original or modified form as yield or damage criterion, respectively. Additionally a further delamination damage model is developed, which has some similarities to the model proposed by Ladeveze and co-workers. It uses the definition of an equivalent energy release rate as damage criterion.

40|$|Understanding {{the thermal}} {{reduction}} of graphene oxide (GO) {{is important for}} graphene exfoliation, and chemical and morphological modifications. In this process, the role of trapped water {{and the evolution of}} oxygen during annealing are still not well-understood. To unravel the complex mechanisms leading to the removal of oxygen in reduced GO, we have performed in situ transmission infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements of GO films upon thermal annealing at 60 - 850 degrees C in vacuum (10 (- 3) - 10 (- 4) Torr). Using cluster-based first-principles calculations, epoxides, ethers (pyrans and furans), hydroxyls, carboxyls, lactols, and various types of ketones and their possible derivatives have been identified from the spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the interactions between randomly arranged nearby oxygen species are found to affect the spectral response (red and blue shifts) and the overall chemistry during annealing. For instance, the initial composition of oxygen species (relative amounts and types of species, such as hydroxyls, carboxyls, and carbonyls) and reduction times determine the final oxygen concentration (% of initial concentrations), varying from similar to 46 - 92 % in multilayer GO to similar to 3 - 5 % in single-layer GO. In the multilayer case, there is no dependence on the layer <b>thickness.</b> An important <b>indicator</b> of the reduction efficiency is the relative concentration of carbonyls at intermediate annealing temperatures (similar to 200 degrees C). These observations suggest that thermal annealing can foster the formation of free radicals containing oxygen in the presence of trapped water in GO, which further attack carboxyls, hydroxyls, and carbonyls, preferentially at edges rather than on basal plane defects. These findings impact the fabrication of electronics and energy storage devices. close 14814614...|$|R
40|$|Sea ice is {{generally}} covered with snow, which can vary in thickness {{from a few}} centimeters to > 1 m. Snow cover acts as a thermal insulator modulating the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, and it impacts sea-ice growth rates and overall <b>thickness,</b> a key <b>indicator</b> of climate change in polar regions. Snow depth is required to estimate sea-ice thickness using freeboard measurements made with satellite altimeters. The snow cover also acts as a mechanical load that depresses ice freeboard (snow and ice above sea level). Freeboard depression can result in flooding of the snow/ice interface {{and the formation of}} a thick slush layer, particularly in the Antarctic sea-ice cover. The Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) has developed an ultra-wideband, microwave radar capable of operation on long-endurance aircraft to characterize the thickness of snow over sea ice. The low-power, 100 mW signal is swept from 2 to 8 GHz allowing the air/snow and snow/ ice interfaces to be mapped with 5 c range resolution in snow; this is an improvement over the original system that worked from 2 to 6. 5 GHz. From 2009 to 2012, CReSIS successfully operated the radar on the NASA P- 3 B and DC- 8 aircraft to collect data on snow-covered sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic for NASA Operation IceBridge. The radar was found capable of snow depth retrievals ranging from 10 cm to > 1 m. We also demonstrated that this radar can be used to map near-surface internal layers in polar firn with fine range resolution. Here we describe the instrument design, characteristics and performance of the radar...|$|R
40|$|Aboriginal {{people in}} remote areas are {{experiencing}} an epidemic of RD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). They also have high rates of infections, related to poor living conditions. We have described a multideterminant model of RD in this setting, including Syndrome X features, low birth weight, heavy drinking and current skin infections. We now describe associations with inflammation and infection. Studies were performed in two remote NT communities (C 1 & C 2) 900 km apart; 90 % of adults in C 1 and 60 % in C 2 participated. Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was the RD marker. Various markers of infection/ inflammation {{and a variety of}} CVD risk markers were assayed, and in C 2, carotid intima-media <b>thickness</b> (CIMT), an <b>indicator</b> of CVD. RD was pervasive, with rates of microalbuminuria (ACR 3. 4 – 33 g/mol) and overt albuminuria (ACR 34 +) of 28 % and 21 % in C 1, and of 29 % and 13 % in C 2. ACRs were inversely correlated with calculated GFR. ACR was significantly correlated with CVD risk markers. In C 1, ACR was associated with H. pylori antibody (300 +), with the combination of C. pneumoniae and H. pylori antibodies, and with scabies and a history of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). In C 2, CRP concentrations were high (median 7 mg/L), and correlated with ACR; ACR also correlated with fibrinogen and IgG levels, with high titre CMV antibody, and with CIMT. CIMT, in turn, was correlated with several infectious and inflammatory markers. Infections and inflammation are associated with RD in this setting. Specific nephropathies aside (e. g. PSGN), this might reflect a general vasculopathic effect of the burden of infection, and another link between CVD and RD, through shared risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Irisin, a novel myokine, was {{proposed}} {{to be able}} to regulate glucose homeostasis and obesity in mice. Whether irisin levels are associated with cardio-metabolic variables, insulin sensitivity, and vascular atherosclerosis in humans remain unsettled. To determine the associations between circulating irisin levels, cardio-metabolic variables, insulin sensitivity, and common carotid intima-media <b>thickness</b> (IMT), an <b>indicator</b> of vascular atherosclerosis, a cross-sectional evaluation of circulating irisin levels and cardio-metabolic variables in 192 White adults was conducted. Insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance were assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Common carotid IMT was measured by ultrasound. After adjusting for age and gender, irisin levels were positively correlated with body fat mass (r =  0. 12, P <  0. 05), fasting (r =  0. 17, P <  0. 01), 2 h post-load insulin (r =  0. 15, P <  0. 02) levels, and IMT (r =  0. 29, P <  0. 0001) and were negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (r = - 0. 18, P =  0. 007), Matsuda index (r = - 0. 13, P <  0. 04), disposition index (r = - 0. 278, P <  0. 0001), and insulin clearance (r = - 0. 26, P <  0. 0001). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, individuals in the highest tertile of irisin levels exhibited higher body fat mass (P <  0. 01), fasting (P <  0. 05), 2 h post-load (P <  0. 01) insulin levels, carotid IMT (P <  0. 001), lower insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (P <  0. 001), Matsuda index (P <  0. 01), disposition index (P <  0. 01), and insulin clearance (P <  0. 001) as compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of circulating irisin levels. Irisin is inversely associated with insulin sensitivity and positively associated with carotid IMT in humans, suggesting either increased release by adipose/muscle tissue in response to deterioration of insulin sensitivity or a compensatory increase in irisin to overcome an underlying irisin resistance...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} shows that people with thicker, or higher stage, melanomas have lower vitamin D status compared to those with thinner tumours. Evidence from experimental studies is inconsistent, but some suggest that administration of vitamin D metabolites can decrease tumour aggressiveness. Determine the relationship between vitamin D status at diagnosis and melanoma <b>thickness</b> (as an <b>indicator</b> of prognosis), in a subtropical setting with high melanoma incidence. We recruited 100 melanoma patients in Brisbane, Australia within days of their diagnosis. Data on factors previously associated with melanoma risk or prognosis were collected by questionnaire and physical examination. Serum for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25 (OH) D] levels was collected prior to wider excision biopsy; histological indicators of prognosis were obtained from pathology reports. We used multivariable logistic regression models to analyse the association between Breslow thickness (≥ 0. 75 mm compared to < 0. 75 mm), Clark level (2 - 5 compared to 1) and presence of mitoses, and vitamin D status. Serum 25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/L (versus ≥ 50 nmol/L) {{was associated with a}} nearly four-fold increase in risk of having a thicker tumour (Adjusted OR = 3. 82, 95 % CI: 1. 03, 14. 14; p = 0. 04, adjusted for age, sex, skin phototype, body mass index and season at diagnosis). There was no significant association with Clark level or presence of mitosis. Serum 25 (OH) D levels in the highest quartile (≥ 69. 8 nmol/L) were not associated with a more favourable prognosis. Vitamin D deficiency at the time of melanoma diagnosis is associated with thicker tumours that are likely to have a poorer prognosis. Ensuring vitamin D levels of 50 nmol/L or higher in this population could potentially result in 18 % of melanomas having Breslow thickness of < 0. 75 mm rather than ≥ 0. 75 mm...|$|R
40|$|In {{baroclinic}} fronts, {{jets and}} eddies, potential vorticity, P = (V + f) / D, connects horizontal motions of planetary vorticity, f, and relative vorticity, V, to vertical transport through increases and decreases {{of the water}} column height, D. In this paper we present evidence that positive changes in relative vorticity of the SW flowing Catalan Current and meandering of the coastal jet follow the 500 m isobath and are associated with topographic steering by offshore canyons. Generally, positive relative vorticity {{is a result of}} cyclonic torque that generates cyclonic flow causing the water column to upwell since both P and the volume of the flow are conserved. With coastal jets that flow over abrupt topographies, such as deep canyons, D increases and flow must take on a cyclonic circulation, favoring upwelling conditions. In the case of a westward flowing current, we would expect the flow to acquire a cyclonic vorticity upstream of the canyon but to enter at the canyon obliquely (Cushman-Roisin, 1994) causing downwelling. Upwelling in meandering coastal jets can also occur when horizontal streamlines diverge, unable to adjust to relative vorticity changes, and fluid parcels {{near the edge of the}} front separate. Using pycnocline <b>thickness</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of D, we show that deep canyons stretch the water column causing cyclonic meandering (positive relative vorticity), upstream of the canyon during the FRONTS cruises 1991 to 1993. This phenomena has been shown to cause upwelling upstream of meander troughs (Onken, 1992) which in this case would mean upstream of canyons. We hypothesize that the increased relative vorticity, associated with upwelling in the pycnocline, fuels episodic primary production across the front accounting for more than 30 % of the new production in this coastal zone...|$|R
