5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings and removed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan {{on the north}} end of the west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son closes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> {{every person who}} asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E

5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

5|$|One {{day while}} Wayne is walking {{home in the}} rain and hail, Homer sees Wayne and he reluctantly agrees to let Homer drive him to Moe's Tavern for a drink. While Wayne is in the bathroom, Snake {{dramatically}} crashes through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> his motorcycle to rob everyone. As soon as Wayne comes out, he soundly beats up Snake. The story spreads quickly and a news segment that features an interview with Wayne by Kent Brockman and a computer animated Taiwanese dramatization of the incident soon airs on television. It is discovered that Wayne is a highly trained former CIA black ops agent, who decided to go into hiding in Springfield. He is plagued by recurring flashbacks from his previous missions, which cause him to act or shout them out, as evidenced when he unintentionally attacks Mr. Burns, the boss of the power plant, which results in Wayne being fired.|$|E
5|$|Pandora's Tower is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players take {{the role of}} Aeron as he explores a fortress called the Thirteen Towers, suspended above a ravine known as the Scar, on a quest to cure his lover Elena of a curse. Aeron can be controlled through both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk or the Classic Controller. The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building {{on the edge of}} the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda. The main objective when inside the Thirteen Towers is the reach the Masters, powerful monsters housed at the top of each tower in a locked room which act as the game's bosses. These rooms must be accessed by solving puzzles throughout each Tower to unlock <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>On</b> his way through the Towers, Aeron must fight numerous smaller enemies: he can perform a basic melee attack, and a charged attack which deals higher damage and will trigger additional attacks if the player times a button press with the appearance of a targeting ring around Aeron.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E

5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
