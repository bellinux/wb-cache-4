5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the heir apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Household Prison of the Heir Apparent. If he reached adulthood, the heir apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E

500|$|Clifton Hall was {{originally}} built around 1400 {{in the village}} of Clifton, south of Penrith, Cumbria, by either Elianor Engaine or her son-in-law William Wybergh. The Engaines had held the manor of Clifton since at least the 12th century, providing military service to the regional feudal lords in exchange for the land, and may have built an earlier manor house on a different site, possibly close to the village church of St Cuthbert. Clifton Hall was initially constructed around an [...] "H"-plan, with a central hall bracketed by two cross-wings, one wing containing the family's living accommodation, the other <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other service rooms.

[...] In the north range, and on the south front, the timber frame has been encased in brick, with timbering applied to its outer surface. [...] Internally the roof trusses have been retained. [...] Its plan is that of a U-shape with its open side facing the west, towards what was the courtyard. [...] The main entrance is in the north range, leading into the Entrance Hall. [...] To the west of this is the Library, and to the east, the Morning Room. [...] The Entrance Hall leads into the longest range, the eastern range, consisting of the Long Hall, at the north end, and the Dining Room. [...] The Long Hall was originally the Great Hall, and was open to the roof, but is now divided into two floors. [...] To the east of the range extend <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chapel. [...] The Dining Room leads into a room now known as the Green Room, which is canted ten degrees to the east. [...] This was also originally open to the roof, but was not a great hall. [...] DeFigueiredo and Treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger, separate structure, probably a barn, and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built. [...] Little of the south range remains. [...] It originally contained domestic apartments, which formerly extended to join the now-demolished west range. [...] In the angle between the Dining Room and what remains of the south range is the Drawing Room. [...] The special feature of this room is a canted bay window on the north side, extending upwards for three storeys. [...] The only dated item in the building is the Fitton coat of arms on the north front, which was carved by Richard Rany in 1570.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring Bob Gurr, who {{designed}} a giant mechanical King Kong for Universal Studios Hollywood's King Kong Encounter. Upon {{considering that the}} life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not all convincing, Spielberg instead sought the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. Brought in were Stan Winston to create the animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create go motion dinosaurs for long shots credited as Dinosaur Supervisor, Michael Lantieri to supervise the on-set effects, and Dennis Muren of Industrial Light & Magic to do the digital compositing. Paleontologist Jack Horner supervised the designs, to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. This led to the entry of certain concepts about dinosaurs, such as the theory that dinosaurs evolved into birds and had very {{little in common with}} lizards. One of the first consequences was the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics, as Horner complained it was implausible. Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding latex skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tyrannosaurus attacking the car. But despite go motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a live-action feature film. Muren declared to Spielberg that he thought the dinosaurs could be built through computer-generated imagery, and the director asked him to prove it. ILM animators Mark Dippé and Steve Williams developed a computer-generated walk cycle for the T. rex skeleton, and were approved to do more. When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the T. rex chasing a herd of Gallimimus, Spielberg said, [...] "You're out of a job," [...] to which Tippett replied, [...] "Don't you mean extinct?" [...] Spielberg later injected this exchange into the script, as a conversation between Malcolm and Grant. Although no go motion was used, Tippett and his animators were still used by the production to supervise dinosaur movement. Tippett acted as a consultant regarding dinosaur anatomy, and his stop motion animators were re-trained as computer animators. The animatics made by Tippett's team were also used along with the storyboards as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences. ILM's artists were sent to private tours to the local animal park so they could study large animals — rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes — up close, and also received mime classes for understanding movements.|$|E
