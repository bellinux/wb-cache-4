It inspires controls and guides <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organization. <b>The</b> source of sound ideology is ethical Monotheism. Purpose is ideology driven and provides the basis for creation <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Working and practicing on core values in the organizational setting is of profound importance for creating and clarifying <b>the</b> <b>vision.</b> Leadership takes its power and moral authority from ideology, purpose and core values and influences the direction, spirit and discipline <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organization.

The 1935 Grains et issues, described by Beitchman as [...] "fascinating", was a prose poem of social criticism connected with The Approximate Man, expanding on <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of oblivion. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich, the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression. People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery. Grains et issues was accompanied by Personage d'insomnie ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard held strong {{opinions}} about many {{leaders of the}} civil rights movement.

500|$|The {{deliberately}} non-linear, enigmatic and cryptic {{style of}} the music video was intended to stimulate the imaginations of its viewers and their interpretations of the music video." [...] Miyazaki offered {{an interpretation of the}} angel as [...] "Hope" [...] and to protect hope could paradoxically mean [...] "to let it go where no-one can touch it". Dani Cavallaro, an author of books related to anime, reflected on this by proposing that hope retains its purity and authenticity when it is ephemeral, evanescent and elusive. Hope may cause exertion and possibly pain, but denying hope is to deny the feasibility or and vision it provides. Miyazaki said that in the music video's setting, humans live in an underground city after the surface of the Earth has been contaminated with radiation, creating a sanctuary for nature. Miyazaki did not find this believable, though, as humanity would suffer on the surface instead. Miyazaki intentionally misinterpreted the lyrics to reflect upon <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world filled with disease and radiation and people's reactions to that world.

On the night of March 20, he entered RCA's Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, [...] "Stuck on You", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number one hit. Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best-selling singles, the ballads [...] "It's Now or Never" [...] and [...] "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", {{along with the rest}} of Elvis Is Back! The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues [...] "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph.

[...] As a whole, the record [...] "conjured up <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> performer who could be all things", in the words of music historian John Robertson: [...] "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [...] raucous rocker".|$|E

[...] In that year, the company elected Matthew Cradock as its governor and received a grant from the Plymouth Council for New England for land roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers. [...] The company dispatched John Endecott and a small company of settlers to Massachusetts Bay not long after acquiring the grant. [...] In 1629 the company acquired a royal charter as a means to guarantee its grant against other claims, and elected Endecott as the first colonial governor, while Cradock continued to govern the company in London. [...] In August 1629 the company's shareholders reorganized the company so that the charter could be removed to the colony, merging corporate and colonial administration. [...] John Winthrop was elected governor in October, but did not formally take charge of the colony until he arrived in 1630. [...] Colonial officials (governor, deputy governor, and the council of assistants) were thereafter elected annually by the freemen of the colony. [...] The governorship was dominated by a small group of early settlers, who sought to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Puritan settlement was maintained: in addition to Winthrop and Endecott, Richard Bellingham, John Leverett, and Simon Bradstreet all served extended terms.

500|$|In StarCraft II, Kerrigan {{launches}} {{an attack}} on the Terran Dominion colonies. At first, her motives seem to be revenge - however, later it is discovered that she is pursuing various pieces of a Xel'naga artifact of great power. Coincidentally, these are the same artifacts that Jim Raynor is pursuing at the request of his recently freed friend Tychus Findlay and his benefactor, the Moebius Foundation. Raynor's forces and Kerrigan constantly bump heads throughout this pursuit, with Kerrigan displaying her now trademark character traits of arrogance and a hunger for power. Raynor soon learns from Valerian Mengsk, son of Arcturus Mengsk and the real face behind the Moebius Foundation, that the Xel'naga artifacts he has been pursuing, when pieced together, have the power to return Kerrigan to her human form. [...] At one point, Zeratul suddenly appears on board Raynor's ship and hands to him a crystal containing memories from his recent ventures. The memories on the crystal chronicle Zeratul's campaign to discover the truth behind an ancient Xel'naga prophecy, a quest which leads him to run into Kerrigan many times in the process. It is through these memories that Raynor learns just {{how important it is to}} ensure that Kerrigan does not perish, for she is the chosen person to help win the coming battle against the Protoss-Zerg hybrids. Through Zeratul's crystal, Raynor is also granted <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible future, one without Kerrigan, where the Protoss are rendered extinct shortly after the Terrans are annihilated. After seeing this vision, Raynor mounts an invasion on Char in collaboration with Dominion forces to eliminate the Zerg forces on the planet. The Xel'naga artifact releases an energy blast that wipes the Zerg infection clean off the planet. When Raynor and Findlay seek Kerrigan in the ruins, she is found to have mostly returned to her human form, with only her hair remaining Zerg-like. However, Raynor is forced to kill Findlay when he attempts to assassinate Kerrigan, under orders from his [...] "benefactor", who is revealed to be Arcturus Mengsk. Raynor then carries the weakened Kerrigan over the ruined battlefield to safety.|$|E
