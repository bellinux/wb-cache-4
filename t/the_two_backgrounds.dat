A small raised square miniature framed by curved gold leaf is on the top left corner of the border; it depicts the head of Christ at the crucifixion. It is interesting to compare the background to this small miniature of Christ's death with the background to the miniature of the Magnificat the response to announcement of Christ's conception, of both it could be said: [...] "The amazing feature is the background, which looks alive, without solid colour but shimmering.

There are only few studies that have measured UFP at inner-city streets simultaneously with other PM components. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contrast of UFP, PM(10) and soot measured simultaneously at 3 inner-city locations, namely a moderately busy street (15, 000 vehicles/day), a city and a suburban background location. Simultaneously, measurements of particle number concentrations (PNC), PM(10) and soot have been conducted on three locations in and around Utrecht, a medium-sized city in the Netherlands for 20 weekdays in autumn 2008. Measurements were done for 6 -h during afternoon and early evening. The mean PNC at the street location was more than 3 times higher than at <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>background</b> locations. <b>The</b> contrast was similar for soot concentrations. In PM(10) concentrations less contrast was found, namely 1. 8 times. Mean PNC concentrations were poorly correlated with PM(10) and soot. At the street location, high temporal variation of PNC concentrations occurred within each sampling day, probably related to variations in traffic volumes, high-emission individual vehicles and wind direction. Temporal variation was smaller at <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>background</b> locations. Occasional unexplained short-term peaks occurred at the suburban background location. A relatively high correlation between PNC minute values at <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>background</b> locations was found, pointing to similar area-wide sources.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the probe}} limit, we numerically study the {{holographic}} p-wave superconductor phase transitions {{in the higher}} curvature theory. Concretely, we study the influences of Gauss–Bonnet parameter α on the Maxwell complex vector model (MCV) in the five-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet–AdS black hole and soliton backgrounds, respectively. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> the improving Gauss–Bonnet parameter α and dimension of the vector operator Δ inhibit the vector condensate. In the black hole, the condensate quickly saturates a stable value at lower temperature. Moreover, both the stable value of condensate and the ratio ωg/Tc increase with α. In the soliton, {{the location of the}} second pole of the imaginary part increases with α, which implies that the energy of the quasiparticle excitation increases with the improving higher curvature correction. In addition, the influences of the Gauss–Bonnet correction on the MCV model are similar to the ones on the SU(2) p-wave model, which confirms that the MCV model is a generalization of the SU(2) Yang–Mills model even without the applied magnetic field to some extent...|$|E

We then investigate shorter Wilson loops and express their energy analytically in terms of the lengths of two neighboring Wilson loops. Moreover, we find that the static force for all the cases in the backreacted background is reduced compared to one in the probe limit, as expected due to screening effects.

40|$|AbstractSimultaneous Lightness Contrast (SLC) is the {{phenomenon}} whereby a grey patch {{on a dark}} background appears lighter than an equal patch on a light background. Interestingly, the lightness difference between these patches undergoes substantial augmentation when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are patterned, thereby forming the articulated-SLC display. There are two main interpretations of these phenomena: The mid-level interpretation maintains that the visual system groups the luminance within a set of contiguous frameworks, whilst the high-level one claims that the visual system splits the luminance into separate overlapping layers corresponding to separate physical contributions. This research aimed to test these two interpretations by systematically manipulating the viewing distance and the horizontal distance between the backgrounds of both the articulated and plain SLC displays. An immersive 3 D Virtual Reality system was employed to reproduce identical alignment and distances, as well as isolating participants from interfering luminance. Results showed that reducing the viewing distance resulted in increased contrast in both the plain- and articulated-SLC displays and that, increasing the horizontal distance between the backgrounds resulted in decreased contrast in the articulated condition but increased contrast in the plain condition. These results suggest that a comprehensive lightness theory should combine the two interpretations...|$|E

The general expression relating the intensities of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds</b> is complicated, and depends on details {{of the evolution of}} the galaxies ’ IR luminosity function with redshift. However, in the specific case when the radio–IR flux correlation is linear, the relation between the intensity of the IR background and the brightness temperature of the radio background reduces to a simple analytical expression which at 178 MHz is: ICIB(nW m − 2 sr − 1) = 2. 7 × Tcrb(K), where the numerical coefficient was calculated for a radio spectral index of 0. 7. This relation is insensitive to the star formation history of the galaxies that produce the cosmic IR background (CIB). We use the observed CIB intensity to constrain the cosmic star formation history, and the relation between the CIB and the cosmic radio background (CRB) to constrain the relative contribution of star–forming galaxies to the CRB. Current limits on the CIB intensity predict a 178 MHz brightness temperature of ∼ 18 ± 9 K, about half of the 37 ± 8 K inferred for an isotropic radio component. This suggests that star–forming galaxies and AGN contribute about equally to the CRB intensity at that frequency. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a setup {{to search for}} the existence of a massive gauge boson A', the "dark photon," mediating dark matter interactions with coupling strength [alpha]'. In certain models, the A' decays promptly but invisibly and might be discoverable in high luminosity collider experiments. Following a proposed setup by Wojtsekhowski et al. to use the VEPP- 3 electron-positron storage ring at the Budker Institute for Nuclear Physics, we study whether an e+ + e- - A'+ -[gamma] signal could be seen over the quantum electrodynamic background. The proposed VEPP- 3 setup is sensitive to an A' within the mass range mA = 5 - 20 MeV. Out of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> e++e- - 3 [gamma] and e+ + e- - e+ + e- + [gamma], we find that the former process provides the dominant background for the A' signal. While positron bremsstrahlung events can be detected and suppressed in Wojtsekhowski's apparatus, the 3 [gamma] cross-section has a large cross section in this range, "faking" an A'. We use Monte Carlo numerical integration techniques to calculate the cross sections and obtain reach plots, determining which values of mA' and a' could be discovered at 5 [sigma] confidence. This background study can be used to improve the VEPP- 3 proposal, and provides a valuable comparison study with the MIT-led DarkLight proposal to search for a dark photon in the same mass range. by Dustin R.

A rate of 9. 5 deaths per live births is detrimental and a public health issue.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has committed to addressing the public health issue, promoting immunizations, access to prenatal care, and hosting crib drives for safe sleeping. Milwaukee’s infant mortality is compared to Costa Rica, a developing country. This unique perspective will be a valuable contribution to the other studies being conducted. An emphasis on social factors is made rather than solely looking at the health causes. Findings revealed that socioeconomic status is not a direct cause of infant mortality. Instead it is a contributor to consequences endured by women of high stress and thus causing premature births. A healthier community is also necessary to lower infant mortality rates. Milwaukee lacks social stability and it is contributing to the shockingly high infant mortality rates. [URL]...|$|E

Here we evaluated the role of syndecan- 1, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in modulating inflammatory responses in Gram-positive toxic shock, a systemic disease that is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Syndecan- 1 -null and wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, a pyrogenic superantigen, and their inflammatory responses were assessed. Syndecan- 1 -null mice showed significantly increased liver injury, vascular permeability, and death in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B challenge compared with wild-type mice. Although serum levels of systemic IL- 2 and IFNγ were similar between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> those of TNFα and IL- 6 were significantly increased in syndecan- 1 -null mice undergoing Gram-positive toxic shock. Furthermore, syndecan- 1 -null mice challenged with staphylococcal enterotoxin B showed enhanced T cell accumulation in tissues, whereas immunodepletion of T cells protected syndecan- 1 -null mice from the magnified systemic cytokine storm, inflammatory tissue injury, and death. Importantly, syndecan- 1 shedding was induced in wild-type mice injected with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, and the administration of heparan sulfate, but not syndecan- 1 core protein, rescued syndecan- 1 -null mice from lethal toxic shock by suppressing the production of TNFα and IL- 6, and attenuating inflammatory tissue injury.

40|$|Visual {{discomfort}} {{consists of}} the adverse effects of viewing certain visual stimuli such as stripes and particular filtered noise patterns. Noise patterns with amplitude spectra differing from those typical of natural images are judged as uncomfortable. Specifically, noise filtered to have 1 /f 2 amplitude a spectrum is judged to be more uncomfortable than 1 /f noise (Juricevic et al 2010, Perception 39, 884 – 899). In the present study, we investigated whether stimuli with amplitude spectrum slopes previously judged to be uncomfortable affect performance on visual tasks. In {{the first part of}} the experiment, contrast detection thresholds for a target against 1 /f and 1 /f 2 backgrounds were measured using a staircase procedure, in order to determine performance-matched contrast levels for the target. Our hypothesis is that, in the visual search task, observers will have a shorter reaction time for target absent responses for the 1 /f 2 trials if they are visually uncomfortable, when conditions are matched for accuracy. With low-contrast targets, no significant differences in reaction times or accuracy were found. With high-contrast targets, reaction times were shorter with the 1 /f 2 background compared to the 1 /f background, but there was no reduction in accuracy. Eye-movement data showed there to be no differences in either saccade length or fixation duration for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Therefore, although stimuli with atypical amplitude spectrum slopes have previously been shown to increase visual discomfort judgments, we found no evidence that this is associated with impaired performance in a visual search task...|$|E

The opposite occurs in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, which show low prefrontal cortical DA outflow accompanied by high accumbal extracellular DA. Moreover, the DBA/ 2 J background showed lower locomotor activity than C 57 BL/ 6 J mice following D-amphetamine challenge. Selective DA depletion in the mpFC of DBA/ 2 J mice produced a clear-cut increase in D-amphetamine-induced DA outflow in the NAc as well as locomotor activity that reached levels similar to those observed in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Finally, local infusion of D-amphetamine by reverse microdialysis produced a similar increase in extracellular DA in both the mpFC and the NAc of DBA/ 2 J mice. This finding points to similar transporter-related mechanisms in the two brain areas and supports the hypothesis that low accumbal DA release induced by systemic D-amphetamine in the DBA/ 2 J background is determined by the inhibitory action of prefrontal cortical DA. The present results indicate that genotype-dependent susceptibility to addictive proper-ties of D-amphetamine involves unbalanced DA transmission in the mesocorticolimbic system...|$|E

Green-Schwarz light-cone closed superstring theory is obtained from IIB matrix model on <b>two</b> dimensional noncommutative <b>backgrounds.</b> Superstring vertex operators should be reproduced from those of IIB matrix model on them. Indeed, we confirm that supergravity vertex operators in IIB matrix model on <b>the</b> <b>two</b> dimensional <b>backgrounds</b> reduce to those in superstring theory. Noncommutativity {{plays an important role in}} our identification. Through this correspondence, we can reproduce superstring scattering amplitudes from IIB matrix model...|$|R
