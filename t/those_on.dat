5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to <b>those</b> <b>on</b> {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range.

40|$|Whether or {{not close}} {{emotional}} relationships {{with parents and}} peers serve similar functions for adolescent adjustment {{is an issue of}} increasing interest. The present study was designed to examine the relations between parent and peer attachment and adolescent adjustment. Eighty-nine adolescents (M age = 16. 1 years, SD = 1. 8 years) completed self-report measures of parent and peer attachment, sympathy, academic efficacy, aggression, anxiety, and depression. Adolescents were divided into four groups {{on the basis of their}} parent and peer attachment scores: <b>those</b> high <b>on</b> both, <b>those</b> low <b>on</b> both, <b>those</b> high <b>on</b> peer but low on parent attachment, and <b>those</b> high <b>on</b> parent but low on peer attachment. Discriminant function analyses revealed that the groups differed only along one dimension, suggesting that parent and peer attachment served similar functions in terms of the adjustment indices measured. Adolescents high on both peer and parent attachment were the best adjusted (i. e., least aggressive and depressed, most sympathetic) and <b>those</b> low <b>on</b> both were the least well adjusted. Furthermore, <b>those</b> high <b>on</b> peer but low on parent attachment were better adjusted than <b>those</b> high <b>on</b> parent but low on peer attachment, suggesting that peer attachment may be relatively more influential on adolescent adjustment than parent attachment...|$|R
