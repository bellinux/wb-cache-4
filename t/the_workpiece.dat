5|$|The process {{depends on}} the type of {{broaching}} being performed. Surface broaching is very simple as either <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> is moved against a stationary surface broach, or <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> is held stationary while the broach is moved against it.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> metal(s), which heats <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through <b>the</b> <b>workpiece.</b> Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> completely. <b>The</b> <b>workpiece</b> is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> or <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E

5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, the composition of <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> and {{the position of the}} joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. <b>The</b> <b>workpiece</b> and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E

5000|$|A cleco, also spelled generically cleko, is a {{fastener}} {{developed by the}} Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Company. [...] Widely used in the manufacture and repair of aluminum-skinned aircraft, {{it is used to}} temporarily fasten sheets of material together, or to pieces such as stifeners, before the pieces are permanently joined. Clecos are installed in holes predrilled through <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> (usually holes intended for permanent fasteners installed later). They expand {{on the far side of}} <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> and then draw and clamp them together while maintaining the desired alignment and preventing distortion of the pieces. Clecos should fit snugly in their holes to prevent shifting of <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> and maintain <b>the</b> alignment of fastener holes which do not have Clecos in them. They are blind fasteners; so they can be installed in assemblies where the worker does not have access to the other side. If permanent fasteners are installed in Cleco holes, a Cleco will be removed when its hole is needed. If <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> are bonded or welded, then the Cleco holes may need to be filled later.|$|R
40|$|A small friction-stir-welding tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in tack welding of aluminum-alloy workpieces. It is necessary to tack-weld <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> in order to hold them together during friction stir welding because (1) in operation, a full-size friction-stir-welding tool exerts a large force that tends to separate <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> and (2) clamping <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> {{is not sufficient to}} resist this force. It is possible to tack the pieces together by gas tungsten arc welding, but the process can be awkward and time-consuming and can cause sufficient damage to necessitate rework. Friction stir tack welding does not entail these disadvantages. In addition, friction stir tack welding can be accomplished by use of the same automated equipment (except for the welding tool) used in subsequent full friction stir welding. The tool for friction stir tack welding resembles the tool for full friction stir welding, but has a narrower shoulder and a shorter pin. The shorter pin generates a smaller workpiece-separating force so that clamping suffices to keep <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> together. This tool produces a continuous or intermittent partial-penetration tack weld. The tack weld is subsequently consumed by action of the larger tool used in full friction stir welding tool...|$|R
5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> may be rotated with respect to the form {{at the top of the}} hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E

40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the weld. The inventive apparatus is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an arbor supported by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are ported hydraulic passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a piston housed therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is moveably seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> while <b>the</b> lower face of the shoulder housing compacts <b>the</b> <b>workpieces.</b> As <b>the</b> welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> thus extending <b>the</b> pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in <b>the</b> <b>workpieces</b> regardless of their thicknesses.

5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} electrode being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to <b>the</b> <b>workpiece,</b> essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E
25|$|Through-feed : This type of {{superfinishing}} is {{used for}} cylindrical workpieces. <b>The</b> <b>workpiece</b> is rotated between two drive rollers, which also move the machine as well.
