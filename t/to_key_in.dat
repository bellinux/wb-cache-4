The scene then shifts <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>in</b> another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{won their}} fourth NFL Championship in 1956. Playing their home games at Yankee Stadium {{for the first}} time, New York won the Eastern Division with an 8–3–1 record. In the NFL Championship Game on an icy field against the Chicago Bears, the Giants wore sneakers as they had 22 years previous. They {{dominated}} the Bears winning the championship by a score of 47–7. The 1956 Giants featured a number of future Hall of Fame players, including 1956 league MVP Gifford, Sam Huff, and Roosevelt Brown. Equally notable, the team featured as its coordinators future Hall of Fame head coaches Tom Landry (defense) and Vince Lombardi (offense). Combined, the pair would later win 7 NFL championships as head coaches. Howell wisely let his assistants {{do most of the}} coaching, and acted mostly as an administrator. During his time in New York, Landry (who had been a defensive back for the team) invented the 4-3 defense. This unit, led by middle linebacker Huff and defensive end Andy Robustelli, is credited with [...] "bringing status to the defensive side of the ball", and Giants' fans of this particular team are credited with inventing the [...] "De-fense" [...] chant. Landry used Huff in his middle linebacker position <b>to</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> on star Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, and this was most effective in a 1958 playoff game where New York held Brown to eight yards in a victory. In addition, those Giants featured Gifford, Kyle Rote, and Pat Summerall, who would go on to highly successful second careers as football announcers. [...] In 1957, the Giants lost their final three games to compile a 7–5 record, finishing second in the NFL's Eastern Division to Cleveland.|$|E

50|$|The KeY tool is used {{in formal}} {{verification}} of Java programs. It accepts specifications written in the Java Modeling Language to Java source files. These are transformed into theorems of dynamic logic and then compared against program semantics that are likewise {{defined in terms of}} dynamic logic. KeY is significantly powerful in that it supports both interactive (i.e. by hand) and fully automated correctness proofs. Failed proof attempts can be used for a more efficient debugging or verification-based testing. There have been several extensions <b>to</b> <b>KeY</b> <b>in</b> order to apply it to the verification of C programs or hybrid systems. KeY is jointly developed by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany; Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany; and Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and is licensed under the GPL.|$|E

Ridden by the Australian jockey Scobie Breasley she led from the start and won by two lengths from Big Berry with Welsh Fairy a length further back in third. On her next appearance, Festoon ran in the ten furlong Druid's Plate at her home course of Salisbury and was beaten by Valerullah, a colt to whom she was attempting to concede sixteen pounds. The win led some observers to conclude that Festoon had stamina limitations, especially as Fair Trial's progeny seldom excelled at distances beyond nine furlongs.|$|E
5000|$|Arrays of {{the above}} types were allowed with up to 7 dimensions, but no {{functions}} or operators worked on arrays; for example, there was no assignment of arrays. Unlike some other BASIC implementations of the time, MBASIC did not provide support for matrix operations, complex numbers, or a decimal (BCD) data type for financial calculations. All floating point operations were carried out in software since typical CP/M systems did not have floating point hardware. The built-in mathematics functions (sine, cosine, tangent, natural log, exponential, square root) only gave single precision results. A software pseudorandom number generator was provided; this relied on the user <b>to</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> a seed number to obtain a sequence of numbers useful for games and some simulations.
