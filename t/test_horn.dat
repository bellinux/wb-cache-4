Thus the horn operates as a square pyramidal horn at the low band and as a traditional multimode horn in the upper band.

Curves of weight loss versus time, and corresponding scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs taken during the IP, are presented and discussed. The effects of horn amplitude and temperature are investigated for "open-beaker" tests. The IP for 316 stainless steel {{is found to be}} about 500 times that for aluminum alloy 1100 -O for the same amplitude and temperature. This ratio can be predicted almost exactly by applying an assumed relation between MDPRmax and IP, i. e. MDPRmax- 1 = k(IP) n. Fatigue cracks and individual-blow craters were found for 316 stainless steel but only individual craters were found for aluminum alloy 1100 -O, although their ductilities are approximately equal. It is found that the IP based on the eroded area only, IPerod, is much less than the conventional IP (based on the total specimen area) if IP is based on the attainment of a given mean depth of erosion MDP. Relations between the eventual erosion rate MDPRmax and the IP are considered.

Human and animal modeling data have shown that painful peripheral injuries undermine long-term recovery of locomotion through unknown mechanisms. Peripheral nociceptive stimuli induce maladaptive synaptic plasticity in dorsal horn sensory systems through AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phosphorylation and trafficking to synapses. Here we <b>test</b> whether ventral <b>horn</b> motor neurons in rats demonstrate similar experience-dependent maladaptive plasticity below a complete SCI in vivo. Quantitative biochemistry demonstrated that intermittent nociceptive stimulation (INS) rapidly and selectively increases AMPAR subunit GluA 1 serine 831 phosphorylation and localization to synapses in the injured spinal cord, while reducing synaptic GluA 2. These changes predict motor dysfunction {{in the absence of}} cell death signaling, suggesting an opportunity for therapeutic reversal. Automated confocal time-course analysis of lumbar ventral horn motor neurons confirmed a time-dependent increase in synaptic GluA 1 with concurrent decrease in synaptic GluA 2. Optical fractionation of neuronal plasma membranes revealed GluA 2 removal from extrasynaptic sites on motor neurons early after INS followed by removal from synapses 2 h later.

In large herbivores, males with large antlers or horns typically have high mating success. The fitness costs of large horns or antlers have rarely been quantified although they are controversial. 2. Here, using detailed longitudinal data on n = 172 bighorn (Ovis canadensis, Shaw) and the capture-mark-recapture methodology, we <b>tested</b> whether early <b>horn</b> growth leads to a survival cost in rams ('trade-off' hypothesis) or if males that can afford rapid horn growth survive better than males of lower phenotypic quality ('phenotypic quality' hypothesis). We also quantified how hunting increased survival costs of bearing large horns. 3. We found an age-specific relationship between horn growth and survival. In all age classes, natural survival was either weakly related to (lambs, adult rams) or positively associated (yearling rams) with early horn growth. Hunting mortality was markedly different from natural mortality of bighorn rams, leading to an artificial negative association between early horn growth and survival. Beginning at age 4, the yearly harvest rate ranged from 12 % for males with the smallest horns {{up to more than}} 40 % for males with the largest horns. 4. Growing large horns early in life is not related to any consistent survival costs, hence supporting the phenotypic quality hypothesis in males of a dimorphic and polygynous large herbivores. Rapid horn growth early in life is, however, strongly counter selected by trophy hunting. We suggest that horn size is a very poor index of reproductive effort and that males modulate their mating activities and energy allocation to horn growth to limit its impact on survival...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most recent}} film, {{starring}} Mel Gibson, is {{generally regarded as}} more revisionist {{as well as a}} more historically accurate depiction of the mutiny than the two earlier film versions. According to director Donaldson, [...] "The major difference between our film and the other versions is that none of the others pointed out that Bligh and Christian were friends. They'd made voyages together before they sailed on the Bounty. And while they were on the Bounty, Bligh demoted another officer and promoted Christian, who was at that stage nothing but a midshipman, and made him second in command. What interested me was to explore how their relationship deteriorated from that point to where Christian leads a mutiny against Bligh." [...] Unlike earlier versions, this film did not portray Bligh as a villainous character. According to Gibson, [...] "It was a kind of fresh look at Captain Bligh, and I think of all the renditions of who Bligh was, his was probably the closest. His Bligh was stubborn and didn't suffer fools, but he was brilliant and just had a lot of bad luck."The Bounty also paints a far less heroic portrait of Christian. In Gibson's description, “Fletcher was just a lad of twenty-two and he behaved like one. The first time he decided to <b>test</b> his <b>horns</b> and fight for the herd, it was a mistake. He shouldn't have done it.” Gibson later expressed the opinion that the film did not go far enough in correcting the historical record."I think the main problem with that film was that it tried to be a fresh look at the dynamic of the mutiny situation, but didn't go far enough. In the old version, Captain Bligh was the bad guy and Fletcher Christian was the good guy. But really Fletcher Christian was a social climber and an opportunist. They should have made him the bad guy, which indeed he was. He ended up setting all these people adrift to die, without any real justification. Maybe he'd gone island crazy. They should have painted it that way. But they wanted to exonerate Captain Bligh while still having the dynamic where the guy was mutinying {{for the good of the}} crew. It didn't quite work." [...] The film also portrays the sailors exploiting the islanders. Unlike the earlier film versions, the native women are shown (accurately) totally topless. Gibson said, “It was a complete culture shock and it was unbelievable to them. It was paradise in terms of personal freedoms - freedoms that shouldn't have been taken advantage of. They exploited the people, fooled them and didn't tell them the whole truth”. Gibson chose to suddenly erupt in violent emotion during the mutiny scene because eyewitness accounts had described Christian as 'extremely agitated' and 'sweating and crying'.|$|R
40|$|Water vapour is {{a crucial}} element of the climate system. Accurate {{observations}} of stratospheric humidity are needed in the equatorial belt, where most water vapour crosses the tropopause, and in the polar regions, that are most affected by climate change trends. Satellite-based observations provide atmospheric composition data with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, but these need to be validated and integrated by ground-based networks like GAW (Global Atmospheric Watch) and NDACC (Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change). This contribution presents a new ground-based spectrometer for the observation of middle atmospheric humidity profiles being currently developed at INGV - Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia. The instrument will detect the water vapour spectral line at 22. 235 GHz by using the balanced beam-switching observation technique. The receiver antenna system has a parabolic mirror and a corrugated horn with an overall HPBW of 3. 5 °. Preliminary <b>tests</b> of the <b>horn</b> performed at the Table Mountain Facility of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California are presented. An uncooled GaAsFET low-noise amplifier was custom-assembled for the receiver front-end. The back-end will be a FFT spectrometer with a 1 GHz bandwidth and a 63 kHz resolution which, given the pressure broadening coefficient of the H 2 O line, will allow to retrieve concentration profiles from about 15 to 80 km altitude. Since the retrieval altitude range is also limited by the spectral signal-to-noise ratio and baseline artifacts, special care is taken in minimizing receiver noise temperature. Low noise temperatures will imply integration times short {{enough to be able}} to observe diurnal changes in the lower stratosphere. In order to extend unmanned operation time and limit LN 2 supplies at remote stations, calibrated noise sources will be used as cold load reference on a daily basis. The control interface, which is also under development at INGV, will be based on reconfigurable hardware (USB-CPLD). Several different sites are proposed for permanent installation.

40|$|The Boundary-Element-Method (BEM) is a {{powerful}} and established tool in computational acoustics. This thesis aims at an enhancement of the method towards combustion noise and half-space problems. First, it is directly coupled to an incompressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to calculate the sound radiation of open flames. Compared to other hybrid methods in this area, the coupling of an incompressible LES and BEM is a computationally efficient concept. The incompressible approach enormously reduces {{the complexity of the}} LES of the source domain, and the BEM requires only the solution of a boundary integral along a control surface around the source region to predict the sound field in the acoustic domain. The thesis provides a theoretical discussion on the general applicability of this approach. It is applied to calculate the sound power of two open jet flames, which was also experimentally determined. A good agreement between measurement and simulation could be obtained regarding one of the flames. Reasons for the strong deviations considering the other flame are identified and possible correction strategies are outlined. Second, a specialised half-space BEM was developed to account for the presence of an infinite boundary plane in the acoustic domain. Half-space problems are of great importance in acoustics, since realistic problems are seldom located in the unbounded three-dimensional space. Often a flat ground, which is characterised by its acoustic impedance, confines the acoustical domain. The presence of an infinite plane and the associated additional discretisation effort weakens the advantages of the classical BEM. One possible remedy is to use a Green's function, which automatically satisfies the boundary condition at the plane. In this thesis several Green's functions are reviewed and tested for their applicability in a BEM formulation. The successful implementation of an appropriate Green's function is verified by several <b>test</b> cases. The <b>horn</b> effect of the tyre [...] road interface has been chosen as practical benchmark problem. The excellent agreement of the simulated and measured horn effect in case of a rigid plane as well as in case of a mineral wool layer validates the developed half-space BEM...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the analysis, design and measurements of novel passive front ends {{of interest to}} millimeter wave electronic warfare systems. However, emerging threats in the millimeter waves (18 GHz and above) {{has led to a}} push for new systems capable of addressing these threats. At these frequencies, traditional techniques of design and fabrication are challenging due to small size, limited bandwidth and losses. The use of surface micromachining technology for wideband direction finding with multiple element antenna arrays for electronic support is demonstrated. A wideband tapered slot antenna is first designed and measured as an array element for the subsequent arrays. Both 18 - 36 GHz and 75 - 110 GHz amplitude only and amplitude/phase two element direction finding front ends are designed and measured. The design of arrays using Butler matrix and Rotman lens beamformers for greater than two element direction finding over W band and beyond using is also presented. The design of a dual polarized high power capable front end for electronic attack over an 18 - 45 GHz band is presented. To combine two polarizations into the same radiating aperture, an orthomode transducer (OMT) based upon a new double ridge waveguide cross section is developed. To provide greater flexibility in needed performance characteristics, several different turnstile junction matching sections are <b>tested.</b> A modular <b>horn</b> section is proposed to address flexible and ever changing operational requirements, and is designed for performance criteria such as constant gain, beamwidth, etc. A multi-section branch guide coupler and low loss Rotman lens based upon the proposed cross section are also developed. Prototyping methods for the herein designed millimeter wave electronic warfare front ends are investigated. Specifically, both printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping of micromachined systems and 3 D printing of conventionally machined horns are presented. A 4 - 8 GHz two element array with integrated beamformer fabricated using the stacking of PCB boards is shown, and measured results compare favorably with the micromachined front ends. A 3 D printed small aperture horn is compared with a conventionally machined horn, and measured results show similar performance with a ten-fold reduction in cost and weight...|$|R
40|$|The monthly hoof horn {{production}} rate, monthly horn {{loss and}} the quality of the coronary horn was examined in the dorsal part of the hoof capsule of Przewalski horses. In order to demonstrate alterations induced by domestication, the results of this study were then compared to related data on the hooves of domestic horses in the literature and a concurrent study on the hoof of warm-blooded horses (KÖNIG, in preparation). The horn production rate and the horn loss were measured on the hooves of 15 Przewalski horses. The hooves were marked, and each month the downward movement of the markers towards the distal margin of the hoof capsule was measured over a period of two and a half years. The annual mean values of the examined wild horses lie within the standard variation of the values published for different domestic horse races. But a domestication-related effect can still be detected, because the values of the Przewalski horses, which were kept in a semi-reservate, show more seasonal variations than those of domestic horses. This difference between domestic and wild equides is most likely derived from the different housing condit ions. In the examined Przewalski horses, both the hoof horn production rate as well as the horn loss are significantly higher in the summer than in the winter time. The annual variations of the horn production rate are particularly influenced by the climatic conditions (environmental temperature and length of day light), but also by the differing seasonal locomotory activity of the horses and the varying food supply. The loss of horn, amongst others, is influenced by the seasonal variations in ground conditions, hoof horn quality, locomotory activity and the body weight of the horses. Another seasonality is apparent in the occurrence of broken-out horn chips in the hoof weight bearing margin, acting as an additional mechanism for hoof length regulation in horses which are kept in reservates and thus suffer from insufficient hoof horn abrasion. The horn quality was studied on the hooves of 10 Przewalski horses which were kept in semi-reservates or in zoological gardens. Apart from a material test by mechanical-technical testing devices, an examination of structural parameters (horn architecture, inter- and intracellular factors) was carried out. The range of methods covered light-microscopical and scanning and transmission electron microscopical as well as histometric, histochemical and immuno-histochemical techniques. In addition, the inter- and intracellular proteins were separated by gel-electrophoresis, and the cytokeratins were identified immunochemically. In order to examine the influence of structural parameters on the mechanical-physical horn characteristics, the results on the horn structure were then related to the results gained by the material <b>testing</b> methods. The <b>horn</b> quality differs in the different regions of the coronary horn, therefore a corresponding localisation of sample-taking is the prerequisite for comparative examination of the horn quality of domestic and wild horses. Keeping that in mind, minor differences in the coronary horn of warm-blooded horses and Przewalski are detectable. The outer coronary horn of the examined Przewalski horses is harder than that of warm-blooded horses. In Przewalski horses, all regions of the coronary horn show a lower water-storing-capacity. These differences in the mechanical-physical horn characteristics are reflected by an equally differing horn structure: The coronary horn of Przewalski horses is characterised by smaller and more densely packed horn tubules which additionally show a decreased cortical-medullar ratio compared to the respective horn tubules in warm-blooded horses. Even the cyto-architecture shows differences in both types of horses: in przewalski horses remainders of the cell nuclei are always present, whereas in warm-blooded horses the cornified cells are mostly nuclei-free. Comparing the results of the gel-electrophoresis, Przewalski and warm-blooded horses show a similar protein band pattern, but the staining intensity differs slightly in some protein bands. The mentioned differences in the horn quality of domestic and wild horses are mainly induced by genetic factors and may therefore be influenced by selective breeding. An influence of the housing conditions on the hoof horn quality of Przewalski horses was not detectable in the examined specimens. In the examined Przewalski horses, both horn hardness as well as horn structure (horn architecture and intercellular factors) vary according to the time of horn production. These seasonal variations in hoof horn quality are correlated to the seasonal variations in the horn production rate and contribute to the seasonal rhythm of horn abrasion and are also responsible for the occurrence of broken-out horn chips in the hoof weight bearing margin...|$|R
