5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality.

5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been duplicated across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Aspects define <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> code which would have otherwise been duplicated and then use pointcuts and join points to define the advice. During weaving, the aspect weaver uses the pointcuts and join points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> should be injected. <b>The</b> <b>implementation</b> is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E
