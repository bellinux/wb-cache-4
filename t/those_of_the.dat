5|$|The Yunnan hare is a diurnal species, {{but is also}} active {{during the}} night to forage. It is an herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. According to reports by hunters, the adult Yunnan hare has three burrows; <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male are shallower, smaller, and straighter than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female that are oval and larger in shape.Breeding usually commences in April. There are one to four, usually two, young in a litter, and in May, the female gives two or three litters.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male, {{leading to a}} more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male. Moulting appears {{to take place in}} stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mk I.|$|E
