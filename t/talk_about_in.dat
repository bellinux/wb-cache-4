500|$|The forced {{merger of}} Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate {{considering}} legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year—before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government {{intervention in the}} matter and would veto any bill. [...] However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned {{to testify before the}} Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a [...] "small operator" [...] successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf's case a [...] "Fortune 10" [...] corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive [...] "Seven Sisters" [...] club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the [...] "non-major independents". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that [...] "mostly all we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens". [...] Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 {{as well as some of}} the international operations.|$|E
2500|$|The above {{assumption}} {{may seem}} non-intuitive at first: {{how can an}} ensemble which is time-invariant have a non-uniform temporal correlation function? Temporal correlations remain relevant to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> equilibrium systems because a time-invariant, macroscopic ensemble can still have non-trivial temporal dynamics microscopically. One example is in diffusion. A single-phase system at equilibrium has a homogeneous composition macroscopically. However, if one watches the microscopic movement of each atom, fluctuations in composition are constantly occurring due to the quasi-random walks taken by the individual atoms. Statistical mechanics allows one to make insightful statements about the temporal behavior of such fluctuations of equilibrium systems. This is discussed below in the section on the temporal evolution of correlation functions and [...] Onsager's regression hypothesis.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, {{the group}} {{announced}} that they would release a new studio album in November of that year. Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer Brian Higgins, {{who had worked with}} them together on their previous records. Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album Chemistry (2005); to his advantage, he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record, along with his production team Xenomania. Member Nicola Roberts reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be [...] "up to date with where [...] at," [...] and further commented, [...] "Our songs have to reflect us so that's why we do it." [...] Moreover, when asked in an interview with Fascination Records about what fans and critics could expect from the album, member Cheryl said they were heading for a [...] "more mature direction." [...] She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing [...] "about things that we would have when we were 16. Now we're singing about things that you <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> your early 20s." ...|$|E

[...] He still held his {{position}} in his college, and still took a good part in teaching mathematics, but he had an assistant who did the heavy work. He had been principal of the school where the Mistress of the House received her education, and she was much attached to him, and he always spent some part of his summer vacation at her house. The Master of the House, of course, was not there every summer, and so this season the Old Professor had a special treat, for there were many things he liked to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> which he knew the two ladies could take no interest.|$|E

Some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night. It was something that seemed all the more merciless, because it might turn out an enormous mercy.

60|$|Now, if {{you wish}} to know what these ugly things might be, which had made their escape out of the box, I must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly Troubles. There were evil Passions; there were a great many species of Cares; there were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there were Diseases, in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes; there were more kinds of Naughtiness than it would be of any use to <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> short, {{everything}} that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box, and given to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept safely, in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them.

But if they must neglect the Lord's {{injunction}} that young girls ought to be modest, then I guess they manage pretty well at the K. P.

60|$|But {{nobody could}} help loving Alkibiades {{in these early}} years, {{and he was a}} sort of spoiled child of the people. He won three crowns in the chariot races at the Olympic games, and feasted and made {{presents}} to his fellow-citizens afterwards, and he was always doing some strange thing {{in order to make a}} sensation. The first day that he was old enough to be admitted to the public assembly, while he was being greeted there, he let loose a tame quail, which he carried about under his cloak, and no business could be done till it had been caught. Another time he came very late, with a garland on his head, and desired to have the sitting put off because he had a feast at his house; and the grave archons actually granted his request. But the strangest thing he did was to cut off the tail of his beautiful dog, that, as he said, the Athenians might have something to <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> truth he made everything give way to his freaks and self-will; and he was a harsh and unkind husband, and insolent to his father-in-law; and, as time went on, he offended a great many persons by his pride and rudeness and selfishness, so that his brilliancy did little good.|$|E

Listen to my plan, citizen Martin-Roget, {{and see how it}} will work in with yours. My idea is to collect together all the most disreputable and notorious evil-doers of this city ... there are plenty in the entrepôt at the present moment, and there are plenty more still at large in the streets of Nantes--thieves, malefactors, forgers of State bonds, assassins and women of evil fame ... and to send them in a batch to Paris to appear before the Committee of Public Safety, whilst I will send to my colleagues there a letter couched in terms of gentle reproach: 'See!' I shall say, 'what I have to contend with in Nantes. See! the moral pestilence that infests the city. These evil-doers are but a few among the hundreds and thousands of whom I am vainly trying to purge this city which you have entrusted to my care!' They won't {{know how to deal with}} the rabble," [...] he continued with his harsh strident laugh. [...] "They may send them to the guillotine wholesale or deport them to Cayenne, and they will have to give them some semblance of a trial in any case. But they will have to admit that my severe measures are justified, and in future, I imagine, they will leave me more severely alone." ...|$|E

Besides, she had shown him that she had extraordinary senses--her explanation would have been stranger than the fact. Moreover they had other things to <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>in</b> particular the question of her putting off her return to Dover till the morrow and dispensing meanwhile with the valuable protection of Sidney. This was indeed but another face of the question of her dining with him somewhere that evening (where else should she dine?)- -accompanying him, for instance, just for an hour of Bohemia, in their deadly respectable lives, to a jolly little place in Soho. Mrs. Ryves declined to have her life abused, but in fact, at the proper moment, at the jolly little place, to which she did accompany him--it dealt in macaroni and Chianti--the pair put their elbows on the crumpled cloth and, face to face, with their little emptied coffee-cups pushed away and the young man's cigarette lighted by her command, became increasingly confidential. They went afterwards to the theatre, in cheap places, and came home in [...] "busses" [...] and under umbrellas.|$|E
