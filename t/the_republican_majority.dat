5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Maloney {{voted to}} reject the Farm Bill. The {{comprehensive}} farm bill failed in the House due largely {{in part to the}} votes of 8 Democratic House members who joined <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> to vote down the measure.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
50|$|On December 3, 1969, the Court of Appeals did {{not allow}} a re-apportionment of the {{legislative}} districts which <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in both Houses intended to enact in time {{to be used for}} the elections in November 1970.|$|R

5|$|Legislation {{proposed}} by the 104th United States Congress included term limits for Congressional Representatives, tax cuts, welfare reform, and a balanced budget amendment, as well as independent auditing of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich's first two years as House Speaker, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time Republicans had done so in 68 years, {{and the first time}} simultaneously with a Democratic president winning re-election.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{nominated}} to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she {{was nominated}} by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the United States Senate, {{but she was}} eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{took the}} oath of office on December 1, 2014. He faced a Republican-controlled legislature, but <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> were not enough to {{override}} a gubernatorial veto. With <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> legislature opposed to Walker's attempts to expand Medicaid, Walker decided to use his executive authority to do so.|$|R

5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> on the Court, most of the {{measures}} he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> 1946 elections, <b>Republicans</b> wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from the Democrats {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|R

Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. Williams was Delaware's first four-term U.S. Senator.|$|E
25|$|He also {{proposed}} plans to “refocus Pell Grant {{dollars on the}} students that need them most.” While he did not provide details explaining how he would reform the Pell grant program, some commentators noted that Romney had been generally supportive of federal budget proposals offered by <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the House of Representatives that {{would be likely to}} reduce the total number of students eligible to receive the grants.|$|E
