5|$|In 1941, the New York City Planning Department {{proposed}} the Gun Hill Crosstown Highway as an upgrade, {{but nothing happened}} with <b>this</b> <b>plan.</b> In the mid-1960s, the Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed a new route just a mile north of Gun Hill Road called the City Line Expressway; <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> also did not advance.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. <b>This</b> <b>plan,</b> backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|The {{characteristically}} northern stepped-diamond plan of projecting corners {{was adopted}} in temples built with an entirely dravida articulation. Four 12th century structures constructed according to <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> are extant: the Basaveshwara Temple at Basavana Bagevadi, the Ramesvara Temple at Devur and the temples at Ingleshwar and Yevur, {{all in the}} vicinity of the Kalyani region, where nagara temples were common. <b>This</b> <b>plan</b> came into existence in northern India only in the 11th century, a sign that architectural ideas traveled fast.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} {{traffic conditions}} in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned {{to improve the}} North Circular Road to a higher capacity, grade separating as many junctions as possible, particularly those at important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London with the hope to ease traffic congestion in the central area. Under <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout {{the majority of its}} length by the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. <b>This</b> <b>plan</b> revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting this species. This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. <b>This</b> <b>plan</b> focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion.
