5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel swing bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> {{bridge is}} {{encountered}} at 26.27km, before Tunnel 15 at (in its middle) 26.55km (curve left, straight, curve right, straight, curve left, 430m). There is a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge at 26.98km, {{followed by a}} timber bridge with a concrete pier at 27.55km. At 27.72km is a small steel deck-type bridge using fishbelly plate girders (Bridge 42) supported mid span by a concrete pier; {{this is followed by}} a single span steel bridge at 27.86km and two single span timber bridges at 28.22km and 28.53km.|$|E
25|$|Travelling west {{along the}} {{southern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, at 20.72km {{there is a second}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 23), with timber trestles on the approaches and two concrete piers, which is followed by two <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges (the first also has one concrete pier) prior to Tunnel 10 at 21.06km (straight then curve left, 119m). Tunnel 11 is at 21.30km (curve left, 83m), and is followed by two very small single span steel bridges over concrete drains at 21.58km and 21.60km. Kelly?s Leap follows, where a modern rock fall barrier has been erected near an early open concrete drain. These are followed by <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges at 21.76km and 21.92km, and then Tunnel 12 at 22.04km (curve right then straight, 81m). There is a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge at 22.18km, followed by Tunnel 13 at 22.47km (straight then curve left, 88m).|$|E
5000|$|... 3x1x2x20 foot (6.1m) timber longitudinals, common braced <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> (piers 8 to 11).|$|R
50|$|The <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> of {{the former}} Camas Prairie Railroad are visible {{throughout}} the area.|$|R
5000|$|Class C: The {{soft ground}} of the tidal valleys at Weston Mill, Forder, Wivelscombe, and Nottar {{required}} a lighter structure. This was achieved by dispensing with the stone piers and replacing them with vertical <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> built on top of timber piles driven into the mud. There were no fans supporting the track, instead timber trusses were built directly {{on top of the}} <b>timber</b> <b>trestles.</b>|$|R
25|$|After Stoney Creek Bridge {{the line}} {{proceeds}} north-east {{along the northern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, over two <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges at 23.39km and 23.78km, plus a single span timber bridge at 23.89km and a single span steel bridge at 24.54km, before entering Tunnel 14 at 24.69km (curve left, 85m). Glacier Rock looms {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The line then passes the site of The Springs Station before cutting alongside The Red Bluff and entering the Barron Gorge. There is a single span steel bridge at 25.49km, and a modern footbridge over the line (Douglas Track) before two <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges at 25. km and 25.95km. By this point the line has turned to the north-west.|$|E
25|$|It {{was famous}} for {{building}} the majestic Royal Albert Bridge over the River Tamar, {{and because of the}} difficult terrain it traversed, it had a large number of viaducts; because of the shortage of money these were built as <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> viaducts, proving to be iconic images but a source of heavy maintenance costs, eventually needing to be reconstructed in more durable materials.|$|E
25|$|The Surprise Creek Bridge, at 28.7km, is a 72.54m long steel {{lattice girder}} bridge set on tall {{concrete}} piers {{at the head of}} a waterfall. The approach spans are pin jointed. This is followed by a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge at 29.16km, and then Christmas Creek Bridge at 29.23km. The sixth and final steel {{lattice girder bridge}} on the section, the Christmas Creek Bridge is 39.6m long, with wrought iron trestles.|$|E

5000|$|... 7 x 1 x 2 x 20 (6.1 metre) timber longitudinals, decking, {{concrete}} abutments, common braced <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> {{were built}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the {{expectation}} that they would be temporary. <b>Timber</b> <b>trestles</b> were used to get the railroad to its destination. Once the railroad was running, it was used to transport the material to replace trestles with more permanent works, transporting and dumping fill around some trestles and transporting stone or steel to replace others with more permanent bridges.|$|R
25|$|There were 24 <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges extant in 2011, {{but none}} of these retain their {{original}} timber. The local scrub hickory originally used in the bridges was of poor quality, requiring replacement work in the 1890s to 1900s. Components of the timber bridges are also gradually being replaced with steel, due to the scarcity of suitable hardwood, and over the years some bridges have been replaced with concrete culverts.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{started as}} a steam powered line running from Bladen Street in Annapolis, crossing the wide Severn River estuary on a long <b>timber</b> <b>trestle,</b> and on to Clifford on the B line, where it used the B tracks to terminate at Camden Station in Baltimore. Because the A Short Line created an almost straight line southeast from Baltimore it snatched much of the Baltimore-Annapolis trade away from the Annapolis, Washington & Baltimore Railroad on which passengers had to change trains at Annapolis Junction.|$|E
25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second timber bridge, with a concrete pier, exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a single span timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is straight with a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E
5000|$|... 6 x 2 x 2 x 36 foot (11.0 metre) timber longitudinals with understrutting, decking, common braced <b>timber</b> <b>trestles,</b> common {{concrete}} pier ...|$|R
5000|$|... 3x2x26 foot (7.9m) timber longitudinals, common <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> with 5 double braced {{uprights}} (Piers 6 and 7) and 4 single braced uprights (Pier 8).|$|R
5000|$|... 4x1x2x20 foot (6.1m) timber longitudinals, {{concrete}} abutment, common braced <b>timber</b> <b>trestles,</b> (two on <b>timber</b> foundations) or {{a common}} concrete pier (piers 1 to 5) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge at}} 19.31km (Bridge 21) is a deck-type steel {{lattice girder bridge}} with timber {{trestles}} on the approach spans, and wrought iron piers. It is immediately followed by Tunnel 4 at 19.39km (straight, 93m). Tunnel 5 is located at 19.64km (curve left, 92 m long); Tunnel 6 at 19.91km (straight, 111m); and Tunnel 7 at 20.06km (curve left, 50m). There is a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge just before Tunnel 8, the latter being located at 20.25km (curve left, 103m), and Tunnel 9 is at 20.53km (straight then curve left, 179m). There is a high embankment between tunnels 8 and 9.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was built in 1853 for the {{original}} Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company line to Sandridge from Flinders Street to Port Melbourne at Hobsons Bay on Port Phillip, the first passenger railway line in Australia. In 1857 the St Kilda railway line had opened parallel to part of the line to Sandridge, and the original bridge was replaced in 1858 by a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge carrying two lines of rail traffic, with the tight curve of the original railway removed by rebuilding the bridge on a more oblique angle as seen today.|$|E
25|$|The terrain crossed by {{the railway}} was {{exceptionally}} {{difficult because of}} the number of north-south valleys intersecting the route. Because of the extreme shortage of money when the railway was being built, Brunel designed <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> viaducts; these were much cheaper but they incurred heavy maintenance costs and were eventually reconstructed in masonry or brick, or in a few cases made into embankments. The spindly appearance of these high viaducts made passengers nervous, but they provided a marked impression associated with the line (although Brunel did use the form of construction elsewhere). The shortage of money at construction also forced the company to install single track only.|$|E
5000|$|... 2x2x20 foot (6.1m) timber longitudinals, common <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> with 2 unbraced {{uprights}} (Pier 1), 3 single braced uprights (Pier 2) and 5 double braced uprights (Pier 3).|$|R
50|$|Some {{sections}} of the <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> were replaced with precast concrete structures in the 1960s and 1970s. The last freight train passed over the Dumbarton Cut-off in May 1982.|$|R
5000|$|... 3x2x20 foot (6.1m) timber longitudinals, common <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> with 4 single braced {{uprights}} (Pier 8), 3 single braced uprights (Piers 9 and 10) and 2 unbraced uprights (Pier 11).|$|R
25|$|The Noojee railway line is {{a closed}} railway line in Victoria, Australia. Branching off from the Gippsland line at Warragul station, it was built to service the timber {{industry}} in the upper Latrobe River area, transporting timber {{as well as providing}} a general goods and passenger service to townships in the area. The final section of the line between Neerim South and Noojee traversed increasingly hilly terrain and featured a number of large <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridges. Extensively and repeatedly damaged by bushfires over the years, the line was closed in the 1950s and dismantled. The last remaining large trestle bridge on the line has been preserved and has become a popular local tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|The line {{continues}} north past Forwards Lookout {{and then}} passes Robb's Monument, a stone monolith {{east of the}} track. There is a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge at 29.93km, before Bridge 50 over Mervyn Creek at 30.18km, with steel girders on concrete piers. Barron Falls Station, between 30.65km and 30.82km, includes a modern platform, shelter shed and lookout over the Barron Falls, {{as well as a}} footbridge over the line {{at the south end of}} the station. The shelter shed has a similar timber roof frame to the shelter at Stoney Creek Station, although it uses steel posts. The line continues along the west bank of the Barron River past the site of Hydro Station, to Jumrum Creek Bridge at 32.54km. This bridge has timber trestles at each end, with a central span of steel broad flanged beams between concrete piers.|$|E
500|$|The first {{sections}} of MD18 was paved as three separate state-aid roads within Queenstown and Grasonville by 1915, and between Stevensville and Chester shortly after 1915. [...] The first section paved {{as a state}} road was between Centreville and Queenstown by 1919; there were also short pieces of state road paved in Chester and east of Grasonville by 1921. [...] The state road in Chester was extended east to Kent Narrows and the state road near Grasonville was extended west through the village in 1923. [...] The StevensvilleChester road and the QueenstownCentreville road were marked as MD18 by 1927. [...] The road from Stevensville to Love Point was started in 1929 and completed to just south of Love Point in 1930. [...] The highway was extended to its present western terminus by 1933. [...] Pavement was also laid from {{the west end of}} Grasonville to Kent Narrows by 1930. [...] The eastwest highway between Stevensville and Queenstown was finished with the completion of a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bascule bridge over Kent Narrows. [...] That highway was marked as MD404 in 1933; the highways from Stevensville to Love Point and from Queenstown to Centreville remained marked as MD18.|$|E
50|$|There are 54 {{trestles}} {{along the}} 44 km length {{of various sizes}} spanning ravines. During construction, temporary <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> were built alongside the proposed trestles to avoid construction delays and speed up construction of the permanent concrete trestles.|$|R
5000|$|... 1x2x26 foot (7.9m) timber longitudinals, common <b>timber</b> <b>trestles.</b> 1x2x100 foot (30.5m) half-through double x2 lattice girders, channel {{strengthened}} timber longitudinals and transom top, timber piers at {{each end}} on concrete bases, strengthened with double timber pier at centre span.|$|R
50|$|The Camas Prairie Railroad in {{northern}} Idaho utilized many <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> across the rolling Camas Prairie {{and in the}} major grade, Lapwai Canyon. The 1490 ft viaduct across Lawyers Canyon was the exception, constructed of steel and 287 ft in height.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tramroad}} {{crossed the}} River Ribble on a <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge. [...] This structure outlived the tramroad by nearly {{one hundred years}} {{and was replaced by}} a precast concrete structure to the same design in the 1960s (Engineering Timelines, 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Mytholmbridge Viaduct was {{the source}} of some concern for members of the {{travelling}} public. The planned embankment had been replaced by <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> which was damaged by winds during construction. In an attempt to reassure the public of the safety of this and the Denby Dale Viaduct, L appointed Robert Stephenson to produce a report on the structure, published 16 September 1851, in which he concluded that [...] "both structures are perfectly safe".|$|E
2500|$|After closure, {{the tracks}} and station {{buildings}} along the line were dismantled and many sections {{of the right of}} way were sold off. The Buln Buln Shire Council purchased the No. 7 Noojee trestle bridge from Victorian Railways for the nominal sum of £1 ($2). This historic eighteen-span structure, [...] long and [...] high, was one of three rebuilt in 1939 after the original structures were razed by the Black Friday bushfires. Architecturally significant as the tallest surviving <b>timber</b> <b>trestle</b> bridge in Victoria and a unique and intact example of trestle bridge construction, it is now registered with the National Trust of Australia.|$|E
5000|$|... 87 x 2 x1 x20 foot (6.1 metre) timber longitudinals, common braced <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> (piers 12 {{through to}} 100) or common {{concrete}} piers (piers 23-26, 31-32, 34, 38, 41, 51, 53, 58, 61, 64, 66-68, 71-72, 74, 76-80, 82-83, 85, 96-98) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{main line}} crossed the Trenance Valley on a viaduct 98 feet (30 m) high and 210 yards (192 m) long, of <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> on {{seventeen}} stone piers. Its frail appearance {{led to its}} being known as the Tolcarne Spider.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{than thirty}} years after being completed, the eastern <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> of the 1919 bridge were in poor condition, and {{construction}} of replacement steel trusses began in 1943. Construction of the 1300 ft eastern steel truss section, consisting of seven 180 ft truss spans, was completed in 1945 {{at a cost of}} , and traffic was diverted from the <b>timber</b> <b>trestles</b> onto the steel trusses with a crossover. [...] The US Corps of Engineers authorized replacement of the remaining portion of the bridge on 2 February 1950, with contracts awarded for [...] to Lord and Bishop for the substructure and [...] to Judson Pacific Murphy for the superstructure, with an additional [...] contract to Pacific Murphy for the concrete slab approach spans.|$|R
