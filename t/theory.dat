At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action <b>theory,</b> social relation <b>theory,</b> social actors <b>theory,</b> and social groups <b>theory.</b> Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this <b>theory</b> as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5|$|In {{quantum field}} <b>theory,</b> one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation <b>theory.</b> Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field <b>theory</b> uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations.

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a <b>theory</b> of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field <b>theory</b> called a conformal field <b>theory.</b> This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field <b>theory.</b> Such theories are often studied in the context of string <b>theory,</b> where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string <b>theory</b> {{as a unified}} <b>theory</b> of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity <b>theory,</b> string <b>theory</b> was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a <b>theory</b> of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string <b>theory</b> that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian.
