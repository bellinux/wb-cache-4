5|$|Only four known {{systems were}} {{observed}} during the 1953 season. This was below the average at that time, which was six. Furthermore, {{the season was}} well below the 1949-2006average of 13named storms and had the fewest number of storms in the hurricane database. Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, compared to the modern-day average of seven. Furthermore, 1953 {{is also one of}} the few seasons without a major hurricane. This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it is possible that some storms were missed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> satellite coverage in the region in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year.|$|E

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment.
