Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba suddenly has a vision of a house flying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and Nessarose being in pain. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle that his family owns that she can stay in.|$|E
5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E

5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E
5|$|Timber {{recruits}} a team {{of eight}} racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Drumstick is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> unscathed.|$|E

25|$|Paths - Pathways {{should never}} be straight. They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the {{landscape}} by adding layers.

The concept is to never create inorganic patterns, but instead to mimic the patterns that nature creates.|$|E

25|$|After {{death the}} soul of the Aztec went to one of three places: Tlalocan, Mictlan, and the sun.

25|$|In Egyptian belief, the {{disorder}} that predates the ordered world exists beyond {{the world as}} an infinite expanse of formless water, personified by the god Nun. The earth, personified by the god Geb, is a flat piece of land over which arches the sky, usually represented by the goddess Nut. The two are separated by the personification of air, Shu. The sun god Ra is said to travel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> across the body of Nut, enlivening the world with his light. At night Ra passes beyond the western horizon into the Duat, a mysterious region that borders the formlessness of Nun. At dawn he emerges from the Duat in the eastern horizon.|$|E

25|$|The {{matter was}} {{resolved}} by the bright comet that was discovered by Gottfried Kirch on November 14, 1680. Astronomers throughout Europe tracked its position for several months. In 1681, the Saxon pastor Georg Samuel Doerfel set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in parabolas of which the Sun is the focus. Then Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, proved that an object moving {{under the influence of}} his inverse square law of universal gravitation must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it.

I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|Julius Obsequens was a Roman {{writer who}} is {{believed}} to have lived {{in the middle of the}} fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the Liber de prodigiis (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by Livy; De prodigiis was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in Rome between 249 BC-12 BC. An aspect of Obsequens' work that has inspired much interest in some circles is that references are made to things moving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> These have been interpreted as reports of UFOs, but may just as well describe meteors, and, since Obsequens, probably, writes in the 4th century, that is, some 400 years after the events he describes, they hardly qualify as eye-witness accounts.|$|E
