5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{development}} of the Westrex single-groove stereophonic record cutterhead led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance, stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the [...] "Golden Age of Hi-Fi", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered endearing by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (<b>transistorized)</b> <b>equipment</b> was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.|$|E
50|$|While {{still in}} school, Brooks worked two {{part-time}} jobs, {{one as a}} local police officer, and one as an electrical engineer. With his knowledge of radar from the Navy, Brooks obtained a job in 1954 at Spencer-Kennedy Laboratories in Boston, focusing on the expansion of cable networks. Upon graduating from Northeastern, Brooks resigned {{as a police officer}} to pursue a full-time career at SKL. By 1964 he was promoted to Chief Systems Engineer, though he had become frustrated with Spencer-Kennedy's lack of technological innovation. Brooks believed that the future was in <b>transistorized</b> <b>equipment,</b> but SKL was still focused on vacuum tube technology. So in 1965 he left SKL to become Chief Engineer at the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company, based in Sycamore, Illinois. SKL's fortunes faltered, and by 1967 the company was in serious financial trouble, so out of loyalty, Brooks returned to the company as vice-president to try to help salvage things. His efforts were unsuccessful, the company was taken over by the bank, and Brooks resigned in 1969. In 1970 he began consulting for a St. Louis-based company that was doing work in Vermont, J.C. Barnard & Associates.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work done}} on the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Tasmania from April 1959 until March 1960 {{under the supervision of}} Professor G. H. Newstead. At that time the Department was concerned with providing equipment for telemetry of very low frequency seismic data from remote stations in Tasmania. In support of a proposal that PCM transmission be used due to its claimed high noise-immunity, a theoretical investigation of the characteristics of PCM was carried out, and simple <b>transistorized</b> <b>equipment</b> was developed for this application: a coder and decoder for the data, and regeneration and synchronization equipment for the transmission link. Other equipment concerned with the instrumentation of geological work was designed and built for the Department during this period. It included a portable unit for measuring borehole temperatures, standard time-signal equipment for the laboratory and high-current regulated paver supplies for transistorised equipment. When this work was undertaken the use of transistors was very restricted and little experience had been gained in the Department in their application. Consequently, this thesis reports some of the early transistor circuit development in the University of Tasmania...|$|E

5000|$|A Super Combat Center (SCC) was {{a planned}} Cold War {{command and control}} {{facility}} for ten NORAD regions/Air Divisions in Canada and the United States. For installation in nuclear bunkers, the command posts were to replace {{the last of the}} planned Air Defense Command Combat Centers to be built for vacuum tube AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Centrals. The survivable SCCs were to use solid-state (<b>transistorized)</b> AN/FSQ-32 <b>equipment</b> which was to provide the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment for operators at 10 Air Divisions â€” 5 of the centers were to also serve as Air Defense Direction Centers ("SCC/DCs") for commanding ground-controlled interception in sectors of the 27th, 30th, 32nd, 33rd, and 35th Air Divisions. ADC's November 1958 plan to complete the hardened SCCs by April 1964 included fielding 3 additional AN/FSQ-32 systems above-ground for the Albuquerque, Miami, and Shreveport sectors. (Plans for vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Centrals to be installed in hardened [...] "cube" [...] buildings were continued for 21 SAGE Air Defense Direction Centers for most of the 27 NORAD Sectors.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{thermometry}} {{has been}} developed and tested as a measuring method for precise and reliable temperature measurements in nuclear reactors. In contrast to the thermometers which have been used up to now (thermocauples, resistance thermometers, etc.), the noise thermometer is independent of all envirenmental influences, such as reactor radiation er atmosphere. It is independent of its previousthermal and mechanical treatment and of the material used. Consequently, the noise thermometer retains its initial precision even after anly length of application time. Thisproperty {{is important for the}} applieation in nuclear reactors requiring Jong periods of exposure. Noise thermometry is based an the Nyquist theorem of thermal noise. Avcording to this theorem, a statistically fluctuating voltage, the mein square of which is proportional to the absolute temperature, is generated aeross the terminals of a passive unloaded network. The amplitude of the noise voltage lies in the range of 10 $^{- 7 }$ and 10 $^{- 6 }$ V. In order to avoid the difficulties of an absolute measurement of these 1 ow voltages, a comparison method is being used, which, at the same time, {{has been developed}} as Zero method. The noise voltages of two resistors, one being at the unknown temperature and the other at a reference temperature, are being compared, Tf the noise voltages of both resistors are equal, the quotient of the resistance determines the quotient of the absolute temperatures. []wring the firnt noise temperature measurements in the laboratory, the electronic measuring equipment was tested. Nereby, an accuracy of 0. 1 % could be reached in the range of 300 K and 1200 K. Noise temperature measurement were carried out in fuel element positions in the FRJ- 2, and it was experimentally proved that even an intense reactor radiation does not influence the function of the noise thermometer. Pur these measurements, a fuliy <b>transistorized</b> measuring <b>equipment</b> had been used, in which the noise of the amplifier was eliminated by Gross correlation. The measuring sensor was heated up by the gamma radiation of the reactor, and the temperature could be varied within certain Limits by the gas supply of the measuring rig. The thermal neutron flux at theux sensor position amounted to 6 x 10 $^{ 13 }$ nv and the gamma fl amounted to 2, 5. 10 $^{ 8 }$ R/h. A series of measurements was carried out in the range of 300 K and 500 K where all the noise temperatures were within the range of a calibration accuracy of 0. 5 % of the referencethermocouples. At the end of the experiment (duration : 3 reactor periods), the noise thermometer had been expnsed to an integral thermal, neutron flox of 3 x 10 $^{ 20 }$ nvt,and the noise resistance had changed by 6 %. The operating capacity of the noise thermometer had, of course, not been impaired in any way by this process. The experiment has also shown that the noise thermometer is applicable even at long distances between thermometer and amplifier (in our Gase 15 m} and in an environment with intense electro-magnetic interference fields. Noise thermometry can therefore be used as a measuring method under rough conditions in nuclear reactors...|$|R
