The route turns north-northwest onto Washington Street and crosses Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line, heading into residential areas.

Here, DE 9 turns east onto Delaware Street and is signed concurrent with DE 273, even though this portion of road is officially not DE 273. The road carries one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. The route narrows back to two lanes and crosses the New Castle Industrial Track Trail before it heads across the Norfolk Southern line again, at which point it turns east-northeast onto Ferry Cut Off Street near the New Castle Historic District. <b>The</b> <b>historic</b> <b>district</b> {{is home to the}} New Castle Court House Museum, New Castle Green, and the Sherriff's House, which are all part of First State National Historical Park.
