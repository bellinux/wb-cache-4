25|$|The {{cultural}} and material losses were staggering. Numerous assessments {{were made to}} take account of the damage. According to the sources, between 4000 and 5000 buildings were destroyed, representing a third of the buildings in the city. Much of this was in a contiguous area where every building was destroyed, visible as the white area in the map at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> There were, of course, numerous islands of destruction from the shells throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|For 250 {{years from}} 1434 the Sydenham family slowly created Brympton d'Evercy {{as it appears}} today. Each {{generation}} enlarged and altered the house according to whim or current fashion. The -long west front (pictured at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page)</b> {{was built in the}} late Tudor period. The two large windows either side of the door provide light for the double-height Great Hall, which was greatly increased in size by the new west front. The older north wing adjacent to the great hall probably contained the private rooms of its builder, John Sydenham.|$|E
25|$|In a {{birefringent}} material, a wave {{consists of}} two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> {{it can be seen}} that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} purpose of HSL and HSV and similar models, and their most common current application, is in color selection tools. At their simplest, some such color pickers provide three sliders, {{one for each}} attribute. Most, however, show a two-dimensional slice through the model, along with a slider controlling which particular slice is shown. The latter type of GUI exhibits great variety, because of the choice of cylinders, hexagonal prisms, or cones/bicones that the models suggest (see the diagram near <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page).</b> Several color choosers from the 1990s are shown to the right, most of which have remained nearly unchanged in the intervening time: today, nearly every computer color chooser uses HSL or HSV, at least as an option. Some more sophisticated variants are designed for choosing whole sets of colors, basing their suggestions of compatible colors on the HSL or HSV relationships between them.|$|E

25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page).</b> In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E

25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E

Eiland-Hall told Politics Daily that after reading the initial thread at Fark which started the meme, he came to the conclusion that for those involved online participation in its propagation was a form of catharsis. He explained in an interview with Ars Technica that it was a means of utilizing Beck's strategies to criticize him and a way to focus exasperation around Beck's style of commentary into action. Eiland-Hall's website inspired copycat parodies.|$|E
