25|$|The IBM Selectric {{typewriter}} was {{a highly}} successful model line of electric typewriters introduced in 1961. Expensive Typewriter, written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a <b>text</b> <b>editing</b> program that ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first word processing program, but the term word processing itself was only introduced, by IBM's Böblingen Laboratory in the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Grimm's text-editions {{were mostly}} {{prepared}} {{in conjunction with}} his brother. In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the Hildebrandslied and the Weißenbrunner Gebet, Jacob having discovered what till then had never been suspected — namely the alliteration in these poems. However, Jacob had little taste for <b>text</b> <b>editing,</b> and, as he himself confessed, working on a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical philology, to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre.|$|E
25|$|Information {{access is}} an area of {{research}} at the intersection of Informatics, Information Science, Information Security, Language Technology, Computer Science, and Library Science. The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users' access to it. What about assigning privileges and restricting access to unauthorized users? The extent of access should be defined in the level of clearance granted for the information. Applicable technologies include information retrieval, text mining, <b>text</b> <b>editing,</b> machine translation, and text categorisation. In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions on copyright, patent law, and public domain. Public libraries need resources to provide knowledge of information assurance.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{hinted at}} by a {{trademark}} in March 2010, Radiant Historia was officially announced in July of that year. As reported by Japanese magazine Famitsu, {{the game was}} 80% complete at that point. The game released in Japan on November 3, 2010. A North American release was first announced in November 2010, localized and published by Atlus' North American branch Atlus USA. Localization efforts for the game began in August 2010, with a large team including four translators for just the game's <b>text.</b> <b>Editing</b> of text was handled by Nich Maragos, Scott Strichart, Mike Meeker and Clayton Chan, while the QA team was led by Richard Rodrigues. During their editing sessions, Maragos and Strichart both alternated between different chapters and kept in constant communication to ensure character dialogue remained consistent. The English script's tone was inspired Queen & Country, a comic series written by Greg Rucka. Speaking in 2015, Maragos later remembered Radiant Historia as his favorite localization up to that point, citing it as far easier than the majority of other titles he had worked on. The game released in North America on February 22, 2011. The game became a rarity following its release, but Atlus issued a reprint in 2012 due to fan requests. Radiant Historia was not released in Europe.|$|E
500|$|The <b>text</b> <b>editing</b> {{environment}} in Emacs uses a double space following a period {{to identify the}} end of sentences unambiguously; the double space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations. [...] How Emacs recognizes {{the end of a}} sentence is controlled by the settings sentence-end-double-space and sentence-end. The vi editor also follows this convention; thus, it is relatively easy to manipulate (jump over, copy, delete) whole sentences in both emacs and vi.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, two {{software}} based <b>text</b> <b>editing</b> products (Astrotype and Astrocomp) {{were developed}} and marketed by Information Control Systems (Ann Arbor Michigan). [...] Both products used the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 mini computer, DECtape (4” reel) randomly accessible tape drives, and {{a modified version}} of the IBM Selectric typewriter (the IBM 2741 Terminal). These 1969 products preceded CRT display-based word processors. [...] <b>Text</b> <b>editing</b> was done using a line numbering system viewed on a paper copy inserted in the Selectric typewriter.|$|E

For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a <b>text</b> <b>editing</b> program to open the file in a window.|$|E

2500|$|While digital {{editions of}} biblical and rabbinic Jewish sourcetexts proliferated on the World Wide Web by the mid-2000s, {{many of these}} lacked {{information}} as to the provenance of their digital texts. Common Torah database applications such as the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project and Hebrew <b>text</b> <b>editing</b> software such as Davka Corps. DavkaWriter, relied upon end-user license agreements explicitly forbidding the copy of included texts despite these texts residing in the Public Domain. Other websites, such as Mechon Mamre, presented public domain texts but indicated that the digital editions they presented were Copyrighted works, [...] "All Rights Reserved." [...] Many scholarly databases containing transcriptions of manuscripts and digital image collections of scanned manuscripts (e.g. hebrewbooks.org) lacked open access policies. In 1999, the Hebrew equivalent of Project Gutenberg, , was established in Israel as a digital repository of Hebrew literature in the Public Domain (excepting religious texts). The limited scope of Project Ben Yehuda presented a need for another platform {{to be used for}} editing, proofreading and formatting religious Jewish texts in Hebrew under a free license in a collaborative environment.|$|E
