40|$|Cadmium {{pollution}} has clear ecotoxicological consequences as it {{is readily}} bio-available and has a reported <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> bio-accumulate in <b>soil</b> biota. Understanding the mechanisms of cadmium trafficking pathways within sentinel terrestrial invertebrates, such as the earthworm, is therefore considered to be of importance. Using X-ray microanalysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical techniques, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that the earthworm has the intrinsic capacity to efficiently sequester and compartmentalize cadmium via a metallothionein-mediated trafficking pathway. There is evidence that wMT- 2, rather than wMT- 1, is the major isoform implicated in the detoxification of cadmium and the identification of three independent wMT- 2 loci (totalling over 25 kb of genomic sequence) has revealed a complex genomic organization. Complementary in silico analysis of over 6500 expressed sequence tags has identified a third metallothionein isoform, wMT- 3, found to be highly enriched in embryonic tissue. In summary, this paper provides a detailed dissection of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of a sophisticated pathway that facilitates the uptake, accumulation, transport, and excretion of cadmium...|$|R

25|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} {{is much more}} difficult to abate than surface pollution because groundwater can move great distances through unseen aquifers. Non-porous aquifers such as clays partially purify water of bacteria by simple filtration (adsorption and absorption), dilution, and, in some cases, chemical reactions and biological activity; however, in some cases, the pollutants merely transform <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> contaminants. Groundwater that moves through open fractures and caverns is not filtered and can be transported as easily as surface water. In fact, this can be aggravated by the human <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> use natural sinkholes as dumps in areas of karst topography.|$|R
40|$|Small {{children}} {{have been shown to}} be vulnerable to environmental contaminants, because of their developing nervous systems and small body size. Children may be exposed to environmental contaminants both indoors and outdoors. They are also more likely to ingestion of such pollutants because of the proximity to the pollutants to the surface, their hand-to-mouth behaviour and their <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> eat <b>soil.</b> The aim of this study was to determine to which degree children may be exposed to pollutants in their outdoor playing areas. Most small children in urban areas spend their outdoor playing time in playgrounds situated in public parks. This study therefore investigated the level of pollutants in 50 playgrounds of public parks from two urban areas in south-east Queensland. The chemicals of interest were both heavy and light metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known to be detrimental to human health. This is the first study of its kind in Queensland and the first to investigate both metals and PAHs in Australia [...] All of the playgrounds investigated contained both metals and PAHs, but none of these exceeded threshold values as determined by the Queensland Department of Health. The highest concentrations of the chemicals were found in the finest particles contained in the playground covers. Moisture played an important role in limiting the concentration of chemicals. More moisture was generally associated with lower concentrations of chemicals. The natural background contributed most of the metals, while most of the PAHs derived from various types of vehicular emissions through atmospheric deposition. Exposure levels for small children were estimated using three different models for calculating the possible exposure equivalent to a recognised reference PAH compound. All estimated values were below threshold exposure levels as provided for under Queensland guidelines. The practice of covering the playground surfaces with fresh bark chips was found to limit the concentrations of metals in playground covers. It is recommended that the practice of covering playground surfaces with bark be continued, and that, further, these surfaces should regularly be sprayed with water, especially in dry areas...|$|R

40|$|Influence {{of storage}} {{conditions}} on geotechnical properties of Ariake clay {{and on its}} chemical stabilization is investigated {{to make use of}} the surplus clay as construction materials. The influence factors in lime and cement stabilization including salts, diatom and clay minerals were studied. The experiments were set up by mixing clays with various proportions of studied factors. As a result, for Bangkok clay, Kaolin and Bentonite, the factors improving the unconfined compressive strength of cement-stabilized clay are diatom content, cement content, CaCl 2 and NaCl in descending order. Conversely, Kaolin and Bentonite are detrimental factors for Bangkok clay. For Ariake clay, the positive factors are only cement content and diatom content. In case of lime stabilization, for Ariake clay, the positive factors are only lime content and 5 % of NaCl. The different characteristics between Ariake and Bangkok clays after treating with various admixtures may be due to the differences in chemical properties. Sometimes, due <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> containing high organic, the soil stabilized by lime cannot yield high strength enough for construction. Organic matters have the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> coat the <b>soil</b> particles, causing the obstruction or delay of the pozzolanic reaction when the lime is introduced. However, the test results indicated that when sodium salt (NaCl) or calcium salt (CaCl 2) is added to the lime-organic clay mixture, the strength of mixture increases with increasing salt concentration. Finally, to investigate the effect of oxidation and drying on soil properties during storage, two series of laboratory testing on oxidation and drying effects were performed on Ariake clays that stored in the different conditions and periods. The results show that after storage, the properties of all samples were changed by oxidation or drying effect. Oxidation process usually produces acids causing the dissolution of calcium carbonate, which increases the concentration of divalent cation in clay. As a result, liquid limit of clay was changed.

The study results show that the soil organic carbon content in the Ili River valley varies with the type of vegetation. In the 0 - 50 cm soil horizon, the soil organic carbon content is the highest under the vegetation types of alpine meadow and meadow steppe, slightly lower under temperate coniferous forest and typical steppe, and the lowest under the intrazonal vegetation and desert vegetation types. The soil organic carbon content shows basically a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> decrease as <b>soil</b> depth increases under various vegetation types except {{in the case of the}} intrazonal vegetation. Similarly, the soil organic carbon density is the highest and varies little under the vegetation types of alpine meadow, meadow steppe and temperate coniferous forest, and is the lowest under the desert vegetation type.

In each condition, lettuce was challenged with MNV delivered at the roots. In the first case, contamination occurred on day one with 5 × 108 reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) U/ml MNV in nutrient buffer, and irrigation water was replaced with virus-free buffer every day for another 4 days. In the second case, contamination with 5 × 105 RT-qPCR U/ml MNV (freshly prepared) occurred every day for 5 days. Virus had a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adsorb <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> particles, with a small portion suspended in nutrient buffer; e. g., ∼ 8 log RT-qPCR U/g MNV was detected in soil during 5 days of challenge with virus inoculums of 5 × 108 RT-qPCR U/ml at day one, but < 6 log was found in nutrient buffer on days 3 and 5. For hydroponically grown lettuce, ∼ 3. 4 log RT-qPCR U of viral RNA/ 50 mg of plant tissue was detected in some lettuce leaf samples after 5 days at high MNV inoculums, significantly higher than the internalized virus concentration (∼ 2. 6 log) at low inoculums (P < 0. 05).

40|$|SUMMARY. Seepage may be {{prevented}} {{to some extent}} by employing proper methods of irrigation. Overirrigation may have a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> water-log the <b>soil.</b> A small head of water, properly used, will irrigate more land and do better work than a large head gone over the land hurriedly. The distance of irrigation ditches should be such that the water may travel between the ditches in about two hours. If land can be irrigated in the fall with the same care that crops are irrigated in the summer, there is an advantage to fall irrigation. If water cannot be properly cared for and this irrigation is uneven, it is a detriment rather than a benefit to the land. It is a disadvantage to ditch the potatoes as deep on the lighter soils as on the heavier soils. With {{the exception of the}} first crop it is best to irrigate alfalfa after the hay is cut. Irrigation of the stubble is more easily and more evenly done than the standing crop. The hay will cure more quickly on the dry soil than on previously irrigated soil. There is no material difference in the yields in sugar beets where the soil is plowed from 4 to 20 inches deep. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the soil is of a sandier nature.
