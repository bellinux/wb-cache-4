50|$|Director Steven Soderbergh first {{spoke with}} Michael Douglas {{about the idea}} of doing a Liberace film during the {{production}} of Traffic (2000), but had trouble figuring out an angle for it that would differentiate it from a traditional biopic. In the summer of 2008, Soderbergh contacted screenwriter Richard LaGravenese with the idea of adapting Scott Thorson's memoir Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace. In September 2008, the project was officially announced with Matt Damon close <b>to</b> <b>signing</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> play Thorson and Douglas in talks to portray Liberace.|$|R

25|$|Blackmun {{continued}} {{to work on his}} opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. After the Court heard the second round of arguments, Powell said he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for Roe to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Justice Byron White was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Blackmun's opinion, and Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.|$|E
25|$|CAI, Compagnia Aerea Italiana, a {{consortium}} of Italian investors, presented a binding offer of €1,100 million to Alitalia's bankruptcy administrator on 30 October 2008 to acquire parts of the airline, pressing ahead despite refusal by some pilots and flight attendants' unions <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the rescue plan. The Italian government and the bankruptcy administrator agreed to the CAI takeover offer on 19 November 2008. The profitable assets of Alitalia – Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A. were transferred to CAI on 12 December 2008, when CAI paid the offered sum. CAI paid €1.052 billion ($1.33 billion), paying €427 {{million in cash and}} taking on €625 million in Alitalia debts. CAI is liable for all Alitalia expenses per 1 December 2008. CAI bought Air One as well.|$|E

25|$|Bender {{brought the}} script to Miramax, the {{formerly}} independent studio that {{had recently been}} acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein— co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother, Bob— was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. The biggest star <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, {{he was still a}} major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax garnered $11 million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.|$|E
25|$|By 1943 this program, {{under the}} foundation's Mexican Agriculture Project, had proved such a {{success with the}} science of corn {{propagation}} and general principles of agronomy that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism. It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the Ford Foundation (and later USAID, and later still, the World Bank) <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the major philanthropic project, known now {{to the world as}} the Green Revolution. It was originally conceived in 1943 as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.|$|E

5000|$|Like Eastwood's western setting character, Mifune plays a ronin with no name. When pressed, {{he gives}} the {{pseudonym}} Sanjuro Kuwabatake (meaning [...] "Thirty-year-old Mulberry-field"), a reference to his age and something he sees through a window. The convention of hiding the character's arms from view is shared as well, with Mifune's character typically wearing his arms inside his kimono, leaving the sleeves empty. Prior <b>to</b> <b>signing</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Fistful, Eastwood had seen Kurosawa's film and {{was impressed by the}} character. During filming, he did not emulate Mifune's performance beyond what was already in the script. He also insisted on removing some of the dialogue in the original script, making the character more silent and thus adding to his mystery. As the trilogy progressed, the character became even more silent and stoic.|$|R

500|$|To gauge how an actor's {{voice would}} fit with a character, Lasseter {{borrowed}} a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monologue from a well-established actor to meld the actor's voice {{with the appearance}} or actions of the animated character. This early test footage, using Hanks' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the film. [...] Toy Story was both Hanks' and Allen's first animated film role.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of Order of the Phoenix, {{the future of the}} Harry Potter {{franchise}} became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> continue their roles for the final two episodes. Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007, but Watson was considerably more hesitant. She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she [...] "could never let [...] Hermione go", signing for the role on 23 March 2007.|$|E
500|$|Elections {{director}} Alexander Payne {{was eager}} to cast Witherspoon as Tracy, based on her performances in Freeway and the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, and Witherspoon was equally eager <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the project—but not to play Tracy. Witherspoon {{was drawn to the}} part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's dark horse presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, [...] "That speech alone made me want to play Tammy! So I was terribly conflicted." ...|$|E

500|$|Francis Matthews, voicing Captain Scarlet, had {{previously}} turned down offers for voice-acting on Thunderbirds. Matthews claims that Gerry Anderson {{went to great}} lengths to get him <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Captain Scarlet because of the skilled Cary Grant impression that he had once used for a radio programme, and indeed the English actor based the tones of Scarlet on Grant's Mid-Atlantic accent. In contrast, Anderson claims in his biography that the impression was Matthews's choice at audition, and that whilst it was not what had been intended for Captain Scarlet, the production team nevertheless elected to use it. Matthews's filmography prior to Captain Scarlet included the Hammer films The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), Rasputin, the Mad Monk (1966) and [...] (1966).|$|E
500|$|Anna Kendrick plays Ginny Ryerson, {{the ambitious}} and {{competitive}} {{star of the}} Plainsboro High School debate team. Anna Kendrick {{was one of the}} first cast members <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the film. Blitz recalls writing [...] "Anna Kendrick is Ginny Ryerson" [...] after her audition and, after auditioning many other girls, she was cast. To prepare for her role, Kendrick learned the typical debating strategy of [...] "spreading", a rapid-fire delivery used in order to present as much evidence and information as possible within a time limit. Kendrick and Nicholas D'Agosto studied with a college debate coach and also viewed a live high school debate. Ginny's comment [...] "I upped your game, little man" [...] was inserted into the script by Blitz from a journal which he asked Kendrick to write in character.|$|E
