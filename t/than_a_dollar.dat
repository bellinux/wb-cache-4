He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a night for the next three and half years.|$|E
5|$|The torch-bearing arm was {{displayed}} at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000contributors, most of whom gave less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar.</b> The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.|$|E

500|$|The {{shift to}} [...]900 silver for the three-cent silver was {{intended}} to help drive the Spanish coins out of circulation. [...] Longacre made changes to {{both sides of the}} three-cent silver, engraving a triple line around the star on the obverse and adding an olive branch and bunch of arrows to the reverse. These parallel changes were made to the other silver coins of less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> to distinguish the new, lighter coins from the old. [...] Since it was more urgent to complete work on the modifications to silver coins such as the half dollar and quarter, Longacre left the three-cent piece for last, and did not complete work on the coin until late 1853. The new treasury secretary, James Guthrie, approved the changes on November 10.|$|E
500|$|The Coinage Act of 1792 {{established}} the Mint of the United States, and made both {{gold and silver}} legal tender. [...] This meant that anyone could present bullion at the Philadelphia Mint and receive it back, struck into coins. The 1792 act authorized six silver coins, in value from five cents to a dollar, and prescribed their weights and fineness. Making a dollar equal to given quantities of both gold and silver made the currency vulnerable to variations {{in the price of}} precious metals, and U.S. coins flowed overseas for melting until adjustments were made to their size and weight in 1834 and again with the Coinage Act of 1853, when the amount of bullion in the silver coins worth less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> was reduced. The fact that the dime (ten-cent piece), quarter dollar, and other smaller silver coins contained less silver in proportion to the dollar helped keep them in circulation.|$|E
500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a day and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled {{with a lack of}} social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. {{dollar is}} based upon a decimal system of values. In {{addition}} to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars {{be known as a}} union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; [...] "dime" [...] is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while [...] "eagle" [...] and [...] "mill" [...] are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, more commonly written as $3.59. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, [...] "paper money" [...] was occasionally issued in denominations less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the [...] "double eagle", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. [...] Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as [...] "fractional currency", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as [...] "shinplasters". [...] In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a [...] "Union", [...] "Half Union", and [...] "Quarter Union", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.|$|E

[...] Out of charity, the man gave the hungry Van Gogh five francs (less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar).</b> [...] Out on the street, Van Gogh saw a prostitute who had recently escaped from Prison Saint-Lazare. [...] With thoughts of the novel about a prostitute, [...] "La Fille Elisa" [...] by Edmond de Goncourt, Van Gogh gave her the five francs and quickly moved on his way. The novel appears in Van Gogh's Still Life with Books (F335).|$|E
2500|$|Following this, the Treasury {{inventoried}} its remaining {{stock of}} dollar coins, and found approximately 3,000 bags containing 3 million coins. Many {{of the remaining}} coins were Carson City mint dollars, which even then carried a premium. [...] The coins were placed in special hard plastic holders and the General Services Administration (GSA) was given authorization to sell them {{to the public in}} a series of mail-bid sales. Five sales were conducted in 1973 and 1974, but sales were poor, and the results unspectacular. There was much complaining among the coin buying public, many stating that the United States government should not be in the [...] "coin business", especially considering that the government had spent little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> to mint and store each coin. After these sales, more than a million coins were still left unsold.|$|E

About the meeting, she explains, [...] "Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania {{is probably the most}} high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her and doing something that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. She talked to me a lot about what she calls the 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a day, and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.|$|E

George was six months old when his father died in an automobile accident, after which {{he was raised in}} Nairobi by his mother and a French stepfather. His mother took him to South Korea for two years while she was working there. Returning to Kenya, George Obama [...] "slept rough for several years," [...] until his aunt gave him a six-by-eight foot corrugated metal shack in the Nairobi slum of Huruma Flats.As of August 2008, George Obama was studying to become a mechanic. He received little attention until featured {{in an article in the}} Italian-language edition of Vanity Fair in August 2008 during the US presidential campaign. This portrayed him as living in poverty, shame, and obscurity. The article quoted George Obama as saying that he lived [...] "on less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a month" [...] and said that he [...] "does not mention his famous half-brother in conversation" [...] out of shame at his own poverty. In later interviews, George contradicted this account.

2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
