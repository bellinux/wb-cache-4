Morse commented: [...] "The first thing that comes <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't {{have a lot of}} time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|An anecdote of {{the battle}} that has some {{dramatic}} interest has it that Farragut was lashed to the mast during the passage of Fort Morgan. The image that it brings <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> of absolute resolve: if his ship were to be sunk in the battle, he would go down with her. The truth, however, is more prosaic. He was indeed lashed to the rigging of the mainmast, {{but it was a}} precautionary move rather than an act of defiance. It came about after the battle had opened and smoke from the guns had clouded the air. In order {{to get a better view}} of the action, Farragut climbed into Hartfords rigging and soon was high enough that a fall would certainly incapacitate him and could have killed him. Seeing this, Captain Drayton sent a seaman aloft with a piece of line to secure the admiral. He demurred, saying, [...] "Never mind, I am all right," [...] but the sailor obeyed his captain's orders, tying one end [...] of the line to a forward shroud, then around the admiral and to the after shroud.|$|E

Comic book historian Michael Mallory examined the original premise of the comic, in which teenage mutants study under Professor X {{to learn how to}} control their abilities, safe from fearful Homo sapiens, and also battle less benign mutants like Magneto.

2500|$|The {{designation}} 'fine wares' {{is used by}} archaeologists for Roman pottery {{intended for}} serving food and drink at table, as opposed to pots designed for cooking and food preparation, storage, transport and other purposes. Although there were many types of fine pottery, for example, drinking vessels in very delicate and thin-walled wares, and pottery finished with vitreous lead glazes, the major class that comes first <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> the Roman red-gloss ware of Italy and Gaul made, and widely traded, from the 1st century BC to the late 2nd century AD, and traditionally known as [...] These vessels have fine, fairly hard and well-fired buff to pink fabrics, with a naturally glossy surface slip ranging in colour from light orange to quite a bright red. The variations in the colour and texture of both body fabric and slip, {{as well as the}} vessel-shapes and the designs on the decorated forms can enable a trained student to identify source, date and often individual workshop quite accurately. Arretine ware, made at Arezzo in Tuscany, was the pre-eminent type of fine pottery in the 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, and was succeeded by samian ware, manufactured in a number of centres in Gaul, modern France and Germany. However the definition of all these terms has varied and evolved over the many generations during which the material has been studied. Technically, red-gloss wares have much in common with earlier Greek painted pottery, but the decorated forms employ raised, relief decoration rather than painting.|$|E

60|$|He who asserts the {{doctrine}} of Necessity means that, contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe, he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects, no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy, or act in any other place than it does act. The idea of necessity is obtained by our experience {{of the connection between}} objects, the uniformity of the operations of nature, the constant conjunction of similar events, and the consequent inference of one from the other. Mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity, if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action. Motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe.
