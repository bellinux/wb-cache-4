500|$|On {{the way out}} of Hades, Euridice {{is delighted}} to be {{returning}} to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her, does not explain anything to her. She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: [...] "Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte"/"Viens, suis un époux"). Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo's supposed infidelity in the aria [...] "Che fiero momento"/"Fortune ennemie" [...] (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?"/"J’ai perdu mon Eurydice" [...] ("What shall I do without Euridice?"/"I have lost my Euridice") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: [...] "Tendre Amour"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore ("Trionfi Amore"). In the 1774 version, the chorus ("L’Amour triomphe") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.|$|E

6000|$|RUFIO (emphatically--anticipating the question). Whoever did {{it was a}} {{wise man}} {{and a friend of}} yours (Cleopatra is qreatly emboldened); but none of US had a hand in it. So it is no use to frown at me. (Caesar <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Cleopatra.) ...|$|E

60|$|The {{young lady}} <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her watch. She rises {{with an air}} of one who waits, and is almost {{at the end of her}} patience.

Then you must have your sword ready, and take off {{the head of the}} man who sits on him, as he <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> you.

60|$|LARRY. Nora. [She <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him hardly, {{without a}} word. He {{continues}} anxiously, {{in his most}} conciliatory tone]. When I left you that time, I was just as wretched as you. I didn't rightly know what I wanted to say; and my tongue kept clacking to cover the loss I was at. Well, I've been thinking ever since; and now I know what I ought to have said. I've come back to say it.|$|E

6000|$|RANKIN. On {{the very}} day that Sir Howrrd and Lady Cicely started on their {{excursion}} I was applied to for medicine by a follower of the Sheikh Sidi el Assif. He told me I should never see Sir Howrrd again, because his master {{knew he was a}} Christian and would take him {{out of the hands of}} Captain Brassbound. I hurried on board the yacht and told the owner to scour the coast for a gunboat or cruiser to come into the harbor and put persuasion on the authorities. (Sir Howard <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Rankin with a sudden doubt of his integrity as a witness.) ...|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA (breaking from him). I {{will beat}} somebody. I will beat him. (She attacks the slave.) There, there, there! (The slave flies {{for his life}} up the {{corridor}} and vanishes. She throws the snake-skin away and jumps on the step of the throne with her arms waving, crying) I am a real Queen at last--a real, real Queen! Cleopatra the Queen! (Caesar shakes his head dubiously, {{the advantage of the}} change seeming open to question {{from the point of view}} of the general welfare of Egypt. She <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him exultantly. Then she jumps down from the step, runs to him, and flings her arms round him rapturously, crying) Oh, I love you for making me a Queen.|$|E
6000|$|Passing on to object-lessons, which manifestly form {{a natural}} {{continuation}} of this primary {{culture of the}} senses, {{it is to be}} remarked, that the system commonly pursued is wholly at variance with the method of Nature, as exhibited alike in infancy, in adult life, {{and in the course of}} civilisation. [...] "The child," [...] says M. Marcel, [...] "must be shown how all the parts of an object are connected, etc.;" [...] and the various manuals of these object-lessons severally contain lists of the facts which the child is to be told respecting each of the things put before it. Now it needs but a glance at the daily life of the infant to see that all the knowledge of things which is gained before the acquirement of speech, is self-gained--that the qualities of hardness and weight associated with certain appearances, the possession of particular forms and colours by particular persons, the production of special sounds by animals of special aspects, are phenomena which it observes for itself. In manhood too, when there are no longer teachers at hand, the observations and inferences hourly required for guidance must be made unhelped; and success in life depends upon the accuracy and completeness with which they are made. Is it probable, then, that while the process displayed in the evolution of humanity at large is repeated alike by the infant and the man, a reverse process must be followed during the period between infancy and manhood? and that too, even in so simple a thing as learning the properties of objects? Is it not obvious, on the contrary, that one method must be pursued throughout? And is not Nature perpetually thrusting this method upon us, if we had but the wit to see it, and the humility to adopt it? What can be more manifest than the desire of children for intellectual sympathy? Mark how the infant sitting on your knee thrusts into your face the toy it holds, that you too may look at it. See when it makes a creak with its wet finger on the table, how it <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> you; does it again, and again looks at you; thus saying as clearly as it can--"Hear this new sound." [...] Watch the elder children coming into the room exclaiming--"Mamma, see what a curious thing," [...] "Mamma, look at this," [...] "Mamma, look at that:" [...] a habit which they would continue, did not the silly mamma tell them not to tease her. Observe that, when out with the nurse-maid, each little one runs up to her with the new flower it has gathered, to show her how pretty it is, and to get her also to say it is pretty. Listen to the eager volubility with which every urchin describes any novelty he has been to see, if only he can find some one who will attend with any interest. Does not the induction lie on the surface? Is it not clear that we must conform our course to these intellectual instincts--that we must just systematise the natural process--that we must listen to all the child has to tell us about each object; must induce it to say everything it can think of about such object; must occasionally draw its attention to facts it has not yet observed, with the view of leading it to notice them itself whenever they recur; and must go on by and by to indicate or supply new series of things for a like exhaustive examination? Note the way in which, on this method, the intelligent mother conducts her lessons. Step by step she familiarises her little boy with the names of the simpler attributes, hardness, softness, colour, taste, size: in doing which she finds him eagerly help by bringing this to show her that it is red, and the other to make her feel that it is hard, as fast as she gives him words for these properties. Each additional property, as she draws his attention to it in some fresh thing which he brings her, she takes care to mention in connection with those he already knows; so that by the natural tendency to imitate, he may get into the habit of repeating them one after another. Gradually as there occur cases in which he omits to name one or more of the properties he has become acquainted with, she introduces the practice of asking him whether there is not something more that he can tell her about the thing he has got. Probably he does not understand. After letting him puzzle awhile she tells him; perhaps laughing at him a little for his failure. A few recurrences of this and he perceives what is to be done. When next she says she knows something more about the object than he has told her, his pride is roused; he looks at it intently; he thinks over all that he has heard; and the problem being easy, presently finds it out. He is full of glee at his success, and she sympathises with him. In common with every child, he delights in the discovery of his powers. He wishes for more victories, and goes in quest of more things about which to tell her. As his faculties unfold she adds quality after quality to his list: progressing from hardness and softness to roughness and smoothness, from colour to polish, from simple bodies to composite ones--thus constantly complicating the problem as he gains competence, constantly taxing his attention and memory to a greater extent, constantly maintaining his interest by supplying him with new impressions such as his mind can assimilate, and constantly gratifying him by conquests over such small difficulties as he can master. In doing this she is manifestly but following out that spontaneous process which was going on during a still earlier period--simply aiding self-evolution; and is aiding it in the mode suggested by the boy's instinctive behaviour to her. Manifestly, too, the course she is adopting is the one best calculated to establish a habit of exhaustive observation; which is the professed aim of these lessons. To tell a child this and to show it the other, is not to teach it how to observe, but to make it a mere recipient of another's observations: a proceeding which weakens rather than strengthens its powers of self-instruction--which deprives it of the pleasures resulting from successful activity--which presents this all-attractive knowledge under the aspect of formal tuition--and which thus generates that indifference and even disgust not unfrequently felt towards these object-lessons. On the other hand, to pursue the course above described is simply to guide the intellect to its appropriate food; to join with the intellectual appetites their natural adjuncts--amour propre and the desire for sympathy; to induce by the union of all these an intensity of attention which insures perceptions both vivid and complete; and to habituate the mind from the beginning to that practice of self-help which it must ultimately follow.|$|E

Pete, {{in the aftermath of}} his affair with Beth, is seen sitting alone on his couch with his headphones on and eyes closed. Peggy, having quickly risen through the ranks in her new career, is shown toasting a single glass of champagne to herself with a smile on her face. A naked Roger looks out the window of his hotel room at the city, in the throes of an LSD trip, and raises both of his arms into the air. And lastly, Don is seen at the bar, where a woman begins to flirt with him and asks if he is alone. He <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her ambiguously.|$|E

5000|$|The second series {{opened with}} 3.19 million viewers, rising to 4.01 million viewers {{for the third}} episode. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said Miranda is an {{acquired}} taste and that an episode can be a mixed bag. However, Tarley enjoyed the festive episode of series 2, saying [...] "Hart got away {{with a lot of}} the more irritating qualities of her work, with help from the fantastic Patricia Hodge and Sally Phillips. Tonight was also the first we saw of Miranda's father, played by Tom Conti, who filled most of the episode's falling-over quota, so that Miranda finally remained pretty vertical throughout the episode." [...] She added that Hart is [...] "a great observer of everyday dilemmas" [...] and the best thing of all is she left the door open for a third series. Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph called Miranda [...] "the sitcom of the year", while Chris Harvey of the same newspaper said [...] "The truth is, pretty much every time Miranda <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the camera, I burst out laughing. And even when her slapstick is so obvious it wouldn't confuse a small child [...]. I still laugh. Even when I'm trying not to. Even when I really, really don't want to." [...] Meanwhile, Catherine Gee said the show was a flop and listed six reasons why, which included unoriginal jokes, Hart's asides to the camera and the show retaining [...] "the worst aspects of the sitcoms of yesteryear." ...|$|E
