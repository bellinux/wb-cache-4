After the acceptance of the Treaty of Lisbon, The National Assembly adapted an innovative method of dealing with the Annual Work Program of the National Assembly for the EU affairs through involving all intrigued parties- the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers. The Annual Work Program is based on the key priorities of the Work program of the European Commission together with the <b>Trio</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the EU. Therefore, this gives a greater strategic focus of the National Assembly’s work regarding the national and domestic priority issues. Leading principle when shaping the Annual Work Program is to include the priority projects from the so-called new files a.k.a. receipts based on which the national parliament ca exercise control in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Thus, the Annual Work Program and the National Assembly further transform into a strategic document through which the Bulgarian parliament participates in the legislation process of the EU level.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. This {{analysis}} highlights potential {{challenges to}} rotation among successive Trio Presidencies {{by the new}} European Council President {{in the provision of}} leadership that accommodates divergent interests in a Union of 27 + members. The relationship between the <b>Trio</b> <b>Presidency</b> and the proposed European Council President is one that must be defined carefully in practice. This is necessary to ensure that the balance of power does not tip to advantage the latter personality {{at the expense of the}} former. Another feature of an increasingly complex institutional system that raises questions in terms of leadership capacity is the position defined in the Lisbon Treaty as the High Representative for Security Policy and Defense. Given all the responsibilities the person in this post inherits, it is necessary to ask if leadership on behalf of the Union is realistically possible to achieve. A corollary observation is that omni directional (tous azimuts) bilateral arrangements, often referenced in the literature as 'multiple bilateralism,' occur with greater frequency in a larger Union. This analysis draws the implications of these experiences for leadership in Europe’s transnational polity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>Trio</b> <b>Presidency</b> {{and its impact}} on voting behavior in the Council of the European Union. Trios of Member States cooperate for eighteen-month periods, with each member holding the Presidency for six months. In particular we study whether belonging to the Trio increases the probability that a Member State vote in favor of a measure. In addition we examine whether holding the Presidency itself further raises that probability. Our study addresses these questions by quantitatively analyzing roll call votes of Member States on 823 legislative acts from January 2007 till December 2012. Conducting probit regression analyses we produce evidence that Member States are indeed more likely to vote in favor during their participation in Trios. Moreover, we find that holding the Presidency itself does not further increase the probability. Earlier work had concluded that, prior to the introduction of the Trios, holding the Presidency made it more likely that a Member State vote in favor. We show that, since the introduction of the Trios, belonging to the Trio rather than holding the Presidency affects voting behavior. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is to test if the {{selected}} theoretical expectation on small states behaviour in chairing the EU Council can indeed be empirically substantiated {{on the case of}} Slovenian presidency of EU Council in 2008, particularly the role of the Trio. It was done {{on the basis of a}} survey among major presidency actors (407 respondents) and in-depth interviews. Research questions like: (i) is <b>Trio</b> from of <b>presidency</b> substantial assistance to new member states, (ii) is the role of Trio different in different stages of presidency, (iii) can a small state be an agenda-setter and (iv) are there asymmetries among Trio members, were tested. Although it is impossible to generalize on one country case only, we established that Trio was less relevant than theoretically/policy expected. Its role was much more important in preparation stages, while rather irrelevant in the operation stage when presiding state is basically on its own. Results call for changes in the Trio as a form of presidency...|$|R

40|$|The present article explores {{whether the}} first <b>Trio</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU), {{composed}} of Germany, Portugal and Slovenia, {{lived up to}} the goal of ensuring greater continuity and sustainability in managing the Council’s work. Focusing on the Trio’s performance in promoting the principle of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) in EU global action, the article explores patterns of cooperation established by the first Trio alongside the traditional roles of the rotating presidency, as the manager, provider of political initiative, broker, and representative of the Council and member states. The contribution demonstrates the emergence of a distinctive cooperation pattern among Germany, Portugal, and Slovenia, which we refer to as ‘Trio effects’. While such effects were established in all presidency functions with the exception of EU external representation, the Trio effects in exerting management functions contributed most in having more continuity in the promotion of the PCD. Taking into account the particular institutional and procedural context in which the Trio operated, the contribution draws lessons for the role of the Trio in the post-Lisbon external action system. Along with the review of official policy documents and secondary sources, this contribution draws on 40 anonymous semi-structured expert interviews, which were conducted by both authors between 2007 and 2009 in Brussels, Berlin, Lisbon and Ljubljana...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{events in}} North Africa and the Mediterranean have had {{consequences}} {{in terms of}} human mobility, and are putting the foundations and components of EU’s migration policy under strain. The forthcoming European Council summit of 23 - 24 June 2011 is expected to determine ‘the orientations for further work’ under the Polish Presidency and the next JHA <b>Trio</b> <b>Presidency</b> Programme for the EU’s policies on crossborder migration in the Mediterranean and internal mobility within the scope of the Schengen regime. This paper constitutes a contribution to current and future EU policy discussions and responses on migration, mobility and security. It provides a synthesised selection of recommendations in these domains resulting from the research conducted by the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Section of the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) during the last nine years of work. This Policy Brief argues that for the EU’s Global Approach to Migration to be able to satisfactorily address its unfinished elements and policy incoherencies, the Union needs to devise and develop common policy strategies focused on: first, new enforcement and independent evaluation mechanisms on the implementation of the European law on free movement, borders and migration, and the compatibility of EU member states and EU agencies’ actions with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. And second, the development of a kind of cooperation (dialogue) with third states that goes beyond security-centred priorities and that is solidly based on facilitating human mobility, consolidating fundamental rights and the general principles {{of the rule of law}} upon which the EU legal system is founded...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In 2007 the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) was reformed {{by the introduction of}} the so-called <b>trio</b> <b>Presidency.</b> The trio mechanism encourages policy continuity by grouping incumbent Presidencies in teams of three and inviting them to coordinate. This thesis seeks to contribute original knowledge on EU policy-making by mapping how trio practices are established, exploring which factors explain how Member States coordinate, and by assessing how the trio arrangement affects the EU agenda. Empirically, the trio function is examined through its implementation in the policy area of sport, focusing on the three trios to assume office after the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The analysis is structured around a number of carefully selected dossiers adopted between 2010 and 2013. Guided by a conceptual framework based on agenda-setting and new institutionalism, these decisions are submitted to in depth process-tracing. The analysis draws on qualitative research, primarily official documents and 37 semi-structured interviews. The findings reveal that actors approach the trio with differing preferences and expectations, leading to much variation in how the arrangement is performed. The thesis identifies a number of factors that explain variation. Thus, a fixed agenda supports trios in coordinating priorities and activities ex ante. Moreover, coordination is conditioned by trio composition, as federal and new Member States are more inclined to cooperate. Further, trio practices are shaped by factors such as multiannual planning and focusing events, with the intenseness of trio coordination reflecting whether the agenda includes issues that demand sustained attention. The thesis concludes that the introduction of the trio mechanism has preserved the ability of Member States to use the Council Presidency to prioritise national priorities whilst also encouraging and facilitating EU policy continuity. By extending agenda-management beyond a six month spell, the trio can strengthen the agenda-setting powers of incumbent Member States, particularly on issues that concern establishing urgent responses or developing Council procedures. Moreover, evidence suggests that the arrangement can produce a specific spirit of collegiality, trio solidarity, which sees trio Member States support each other during negotiations, thus affecting EU policy-making beyond agenda-management...|$|E
