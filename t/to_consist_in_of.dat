Bioelectroreduction of oxygen based on direct electron transfer between each of two forms of Trametes pubescens laccase and spectrographic graphite electrodes has been demonstrated and studied.

Forms of independent judgement within the sector appeared compromised, while judgement over the sector seemed unattainable. Elites, in the classical Millsian sense of those taking tacitly coordinated, ‘big decisions’ over the rest of the public, seem absent. This article argues that the eradication of jurisdictional elites is an effect of neoliberalism, as articulated most coherently by Hayek. It characterises the neoliberal project as an effort to elevate ‘unconscious’ processes over ‘conscious’ ones, which in practice means elevating cybernetic, non-human systems and processes over discursive spheres of politics and judgement. Yet such a system still produces its own types of elite power, which come <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> acts <b>of</b> translation, rather than judgment.

The exact solution of London equations for films of arbritrary thickness with a generic distribution of vortex lines, curved or straight, is obtained by generalizing the results reported by the author and E.
