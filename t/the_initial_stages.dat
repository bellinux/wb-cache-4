40|$|Abstract The {{precipitation}} {{behavior of}} Mg and Si during storage at RT in Al-Mg-Si alloys pre-aged at 90 °C was studied using a tensile test and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) measurement. Specimens were solutionized at 530 °C, water-quenched and then pre-aged for 2, 6 and 12 hours at 90 °C during which small precipitates were formed. In the pre-aged alloy, the strengthening rate at RT has two <b>stages.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> yield strength increases slowly with the aging time and in the final stage, it increases rapidly. In <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> strength in the pre-aged alloy is smaller than that in the non pre-aged alloy, while in the final stage, the strength in the pre-aged alloy is larger than that in the non pre-aged alloy. Furthermore, the period of <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> {{is dependent on the}} pre-aging period at 90 °C. The DSC curves of alloys in <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> do not show the presence of clusters, while those in the final stage do. It seems that in <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> Mg and Si atoms accumulate around the small precipitates that have been formed in pre-aging at 90 °C while in the final stage, the clusters of these atoms are formed...|$|R

The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of naval base development.|$|E
