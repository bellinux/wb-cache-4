5000|$|Thread limit or pitch {{diameter}} limit {{is a standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the {{pitch diameter}} is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> control...|$|E

2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter).</b> Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the <b>thread's</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter.</b> Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific <b>diameter,</b> commonly the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter,</b> or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|R
50|$|The Whitworth thread was the world's first {{national}} screw thread standard, devised and specified by Joseph Whitworth in 1841. Until then, the only standardization was what little {{had been done}} by individual people and companies, with some companies' in-house standards spreading a bit within their industries. Whitworth's new standard specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the <b>pitch.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> increases with <b>diameter</b> in steps specified on a chart.|$|R
50|$|Others followed. Examples were a French {{mechanic}} surnamed Senot, who in 1795 {{created a}} screw-cutting lathe capable of industrial-level production, and David Wilkinson of Vermont, who employed a slide rest in 1798. However, these inventors were soon overshadowed by Henry Maudslay, who in 1800 created a screw-cutting lathe that is frequently {{cited as the}} first. Clearly, his was not the first; however, his did become the best known, spreading {{to the rest of}} the world the winning combination of leadscrew, slide-rest, and change gears, in an arrangement practical to use and robust enough for cutting metal. These late-18th-century screw-cutting lathes represented the breakthrough development of the technology. They permitted the large-scale, industrial production of screws that were interchangeable. Standardization of threadforms (including <b>thread</b> angle, <b>pitches,</b> major <b>diameters,</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters,</b> etc.) began immediately on the intra-company level, and by the end of the 19th century, it had been carried to the international level (although pluralities of standards still exist).|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in the aerospace technology and mechanical engineering where the key parameters characterizing structural components and articles are related to their weight characteristics {{as well as their}} performance under high temperatures. For the experimental investigation of composite-based threaded items, the rod-based 3 Dreinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) was chosen. The subject of the research was the metric thread. The test samples were cut of the aforesaid material along one of the reinforcement direction. The following thread sizes were analyzed: М 24 × 1. 5; М 24 × 2; М 24 × 3. Dependence of the thread strength on the number of thread turns was determined within the range of 1 to 10 thread turns for М 24 × 2 thread size. The remaining test samples were used to obtain the relationship between the thread load bearing capacity and the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch.</b> The obtained dependence of the thread load bearing capacity on the number of thread turns showed the following: a) An increment in the thread load bearing capacity decreases with increasing number of thread turns. However, this effect is less pronounced than that observed for the metal ‘screw/nut’ pair. b) With the CCCM material under study, it proved to be impossible to test configurations having only 1 or 2 thread turns. c) The wide confidence range (CR) of the failure load {{can be explained by the}} fact that the material under study features an apparent structural heterogeneity, with a different probability of hitting a unit cell of the matrix and filler of the material. Nevertheless, the confidence range is stable, thus indicating indirectly the possibility of using this test method for further study of composite-based threaded items. There is an explicit correlation between the thread load bearing capacity and the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch.</b> Increase in the thread strength with increasing <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> depends on the relationship between the pitch size and the characteristic size of the unit cell of the material. The test research has shown that it is possible to make CCCM-based screw joints designed for operation under high temperatures as an alternative for metal screw joints, provided that the key parameters such as the <b>thread</b> profile, <b>pitch,</b> <b>diameter</b> and the number of thread turns are properly chosen. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements imposed to the modern mechanisms is economic feasibility. Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of screw and nut thread. Rollers, as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of screw thread starts which equals to a number of nut thread starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of screw thread starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of screw thread starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of screw thread starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> to average screw thread diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage of curves for relation of efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of screw thread starts. By taking this assemblage of curves as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of screw thread starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> to average <b>diameter</b> of screw thread which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|R

50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter.</b> The term module is understood to mean the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth.
