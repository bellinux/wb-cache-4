40|$|Large inter-individual {{variability}} in drug response and toxicity, {{as well as}} in drug concentrations after application of the same dosage, can be of genetic, physiological, pathophysiological, or environmental origin. Absorption, distribution and metabolism of a drug and interactions with its target often are determined by genetic differences. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variations can appear at the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (e. g., the cytochrome P 450 system), drug transporters, drug targets or other biomarker genes. Pharmacogenetics or <b>toxicogenetics</b> can therefore be relevant in forensic toxicology. This review presents relevant aspects together with some examples from daily routines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pharmacogenetics and {{pharmacogenomics}} {{deal with}} the role of genetic factors in drug effectiveness and adverse drug reactions. The promise of a personalized medicine is beginning to be explored but requires much more clinical and translational research. Specific DNA abnormalities in some cancers already have led to effective targeted treatments. Racially determined frequency differences in pharmacogenetic traits may affect choice of treatment requiring specific testing rather than basing treatments according to racial designation. The role of genes in variable responses to foreign chemicals (xenobiotics) has been termed ecogenetics or <b>toxicogenetics</b> raising problems in public health and occupational medicine. Nutrigenetics refers to genetic variation in response to nutrients and may affect nutritional requirements and predisposition to chronic disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} {{to drugs and}} environmental chemicals varies with genotype. Some patients react well to drugs, while others may not benefit, or may even respond adversely. Individuals also experi-ence different reactions to environmental agents, such as allergens. The sequencing {{of the human genome}} and the large-scale identi-fication of genome polymorphisms have provided opportunities for understanding the genetic basis for individual differences in {{response to}} potential toxicants: an area of study that {{has come to be known}} as <b>toxicogenetics.</b> In this article, we discuss the potential applications and implications of this evolving branch of toxicol-ogy. Variability in the Human Genome Only approximately 0. 1 % of the three billion base pairs of DNA that comprise the human genome varies in sequence between individuals.

40|$|Many {{elements}} and compounds present in the environment pose significant health risks to exposed individuals, {{and contribute to the}} burden of disease for society. For any exposed person the outcome may be affected by fac-tors such as the degree of exposure, age, and genetically determined differences in uptake, elimination, or sensitivity to the toxic effects of the substance. Investigation of such genetic differences has been called <b>toxicogenetics</b> (Orphanides and Kimber 2003), and although most work has been done on toxic reactions to therapeutic drugs, the approach is equally applicable to the study of environ-mental pollutants. There has long been concern about chronic toxic effects of the elements lead, cad-mium, arsenic, and mercury, and an extensive literature exists on their associations with a range of conditions. For lead, the main com-munity concerns are about impaired intellec-tual development in infancy and childhoo...|$|E
40|$|Toxicology {{is one of}} the {{scientific}} disciplines that has most evolved in recent years due to scientific and technological advances that have created {{a deeper understanding of the}} genetic and molecular basis for appreciative variability in toxic response from one person to another. The application of this knowledge in toxicology is known as <b>toxicogenetics</b> and toxicogenomics. The latter is the discipline that studies the genomic response of organisms exposed to chemical agents, including drugs, environmental pollutants, food additives, and other commonly used chemical products. The use of emerging omic technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics techniques, permits the analysis of many variants of genes simultaneously in an organism exposed to toxic agents in order to search for genes susceptible to damage, to detect patterns and mechanisms of toxicity, and determine specific profiles of gene expression that give origin to biomarkers of exposure and risk. This constitutes predictive toxicology...|$|E
40|$|Noninvasive in vivo imaging {{offers a}} novel {{approach}} to preclinical studies opening the possibility of investigating biological events in the spatiotemporal dimension (eg, in any district {{of the body in}} time). Toxicological analysis may benefit from this novel approach through precise identification of the time and the target organs of toxicity manifestations, and assessment of the reversibility of toxic insults. The current limitation for routine application of this technology is the lack of appropriate surrogate markers for imaging toxicological events. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo imaging of a proliferation marker is capable of measuring the reduction of cell proliferation due to genotoxic/apoptotic agents, c rays or antineoplastic drugs, or the increased proliferation associated with the inflammatory and regenerative reactions occurring after a toxic insult. A number of tools are currently available for imaging proliferation in preclinical and clinical settings, however our data provide a novel way to translate the evidence of toxic effects obtained in preclinical animal studies, by the direct, noninvasive measure of dividing cells in humans. Key words: antineoplastic toxicology; toxicological markers; cell proliferation; in vivo imaging; kinetics of toxic effects. Current in vivo preclinical toxicological tests are based on phys-iological, morphological, histological, molecular, <b>toxicogenetics,</b> and toxicogenomic studies (Theodosiou et al., 2014), that ar...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a {{constantly}} increasing concern regarding the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential {{of a variety of}} harmful environmental factors to which humans are exposed in their natural and anthropogenic environment. These factors exert their hazardous potential in humans' personal (diet, smoking, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics) and occupational environment that constitute part of the anthropogenic environment. It is well known that genetic damage due to these factors has dramatic implications for human health. Since most of the environmental genotoxic factors induce arrest or delay in cell cycle progression, the conventional analysis of chromosomes at metaphase may underestimate their genotoxic potential. Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) induced either by means of cell fusion or specific chemicals, enables the microscopic visualization of interphase chromosomes whose morphology depends on the cell cycle stage, as well as the analysis of structural and numerical aberrations at the G 1 and G 2 phases of the cell cycle. The PCC has been successfully used in problems involving cell cycle analysis, diagnosis and prognosis of human leukaemia, assessment of interphase chromosome malformations resulting from exposure to radiation or chemicals, as well as elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the conversion of DNA damage into chromosomal damage. In this report, particular emphasis is given to the advantages of the PCC methodology used as an alternative to conventional metaphase analysis in answering questions in the fields of radiobiology, biological dosimetry, <b>toxicogenetics,</b> clinical cytogenetics and experimental therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvaluation and {{sequencing}} of heritable alterations {{in the human}} genome and the large-scale identification of gene polymorphism for understanding the genetic background of individuals in response to potential toxicants are provided by <b>toxicogenetics.</b> Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes play role not only phase I-dependent metabolism of xenobiotics but also metabolism of endogenous compounds. CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 E 1 enzymes, which are in phase I enzymes, are responsible for metabolic activation and detoxification of several chemical compounds. In the present study, it was determined the genotype and allele frequency of CYP 1 A 1 ∗ 2 A, CYP 1 A 2 ∗ 1 C, CYP 1 A 2 ∗ 1 F, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 2 E 1 ∗ 6, very common and functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in Turkish healthy volunteers. It is believed that the determination of polymorphisms in the enzymes may be beneficial to prevent and reduce and adverse effects and death in response to drugs. The allele frequencies of these genes were 24 %, 9 %, 33 %, 42 %, and 12 %, respectively. In the present study, the genotype profile of Turkish population was determined about critical enzymes for xenobiotic metabolism. It is suggested that the obtained results might be beneficial in order to dose adjustment of drugs and prevention of adverse reactions, and further investigation about mentioned enzymes and their polymorphisms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Case-control {{studies have}} {{previously}} associated polymorphisms in the gene encoding the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT 2) with endometriosis, a common multifactorial disease in women. These studies, however, have been problematic on methodological grounds and their results are inconclusive. To {{better understand the}} possible relationship between the NAT 2 gene and endometriosis, we characterized its homologue in the rhesus macaque, an animal model for the disease. METHODS: Human NAT 2 -specific primers were used to isolate orthologous gene sequences from four unrelated rhesus macaques of the same colony. Recombinant proteins were expressed in mammalian cells and analysed {{for their ability to}} acetylate NAT substrates and bind anti-NAT antibodies. RESULTS: A polymorphic gene, showing 94 % identity to human NAT 2, was identified in the rhesus macaque. Its two characterized alleles, designated (MACMU) NAT 2 * 1 and (MACMU) NAT 2 * 2, were differentiated by one synonymous (C(624) T) and one nonsynonymous (G(691) A) polymorphism, the latter causing a Val(231) Ile substitution. The recombinant (MACMU) NAT 2 protein was not recognized by anti-(HUMAN) NAT 1 antibody, but reacted with antibodies against (HUMAN) NAT 2 or the active site of NAT. Rhesus NAT 2 provided relatively high acetylation activity with p-anisidine, lower activity with procainamide, sulphamethazine or 5 -aminosalicylate and poor activity with p-aminobenzoic acid. Differences in the activities of the two allozymes were evident with most substrates. CONCLUSIONS: A polymorphic homologue of human NAT 2 was characterized in the rhesus macaque, to facilitate investigations of the postulated involvement of this isoenzyme in the <b>toxicogenetics</b> of endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{complications}} of antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{have emerged as}} a major concern for long-term, successful management of HIV infection. Variability in the response to ART between individuals has been increasingly linked to the genetic background of patients, as regards efficacy and susceptibility to adverse reactions (<b>toxicogenetics).</b> This review summarizes the biological and methodological background for the genetic prediction of metabolic toxicity of ART. Recent studies are discussed which suggest that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes involved in lipid metabolism and lipid transport {{in the general population}} (ABCA 1, APOA 5, APOC 3, APOE, CETP) might modulate plasma triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in HIV-infected patients. At present, genetic prediction of lipodystrophy is not possible. Lipodystrophy has been linked to an accumulation of mtDNA mutations, a finding causally associated with ageing phenotypes in animal models. No mutations in LMNA, a gene linked to rare, inherited forms of lipodystrophy, have been identified in small studies of patients with lipodystrophy, and a possible link to a TNF promoter SNP remains to be confirmed. With the rapidly decreasing cost of genetic testing, the main issues {{that need to be addressed}} prior to introduction of toxicogenetic prediction in HIV clinical practice include reproducibly high predictive values of SNP associations with clinically relevant and well defined metabolic outcomes, studies that evaluate the contribution of SNPs in the context of multi-SNP and haplotype analysis, and the validation of genetic markers in independent, large patient cohorts. Comprehensive, whole genome approaches are increasingly being used...|$|E
40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Dichloroacetate (DCA) {{is known}} to {{environmental}} scientists as a by-product of water chlorination and as a metabolite of industrial solvents, including Superfund chemicals. In contrast, DCA is studied by clinical investigators for its therapeutic potential in several life-threatening conditions, including genetic mitochondrial diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and cancer. Thus, DCA holds an almost unique position at the interface between environmental science and allopathic medicine. Objective: I critically reviewed laboratory and clinical pharmacological research on DCA to address questions about the current and future status of DCA in relation to human health. Discussion: Recent information on the clinical <b>toxicogenetics</b> of DCA is interpreted {{particularly in light of}} its use as an investigational drug. Adverse effects from chronic DCA exposure have been identified in several target organs in animals. However, in humans, toxicity has so far been limited to reversible effects on the nervous system and liver. DCA is primarily biotransformed to glyoxylate by the bifunctional enzyme glutathione transferase zeta 1 and maleylacetoacetate isomerase (GSTz 1 / MAAI), which also catalyzes the penultimate step in the phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolic pathway. DCA is a suicide inhibitor of GSTz 1 /MAAI, which can result in delayed plasma clearance of DCA and the accumulation of potentially toxic tyrosine intermediates. Age and GSTz 1 /MAAI haplotype can markedly affect the toxicokinetics of DCA in humans and rodents. Co n c l u s i o n s: I have defined new potential avenues of research that focus on discrete human populations that may be at increased health risk or that may receive increased health benefit from chronic exposure to DCA at both environmentally and clinically relevant concentrations. Key w o r d s: cancer, dichloroacetate, glutathione transferase zeta, hereditary tyrosinemia, maleylacetoacetate isomerase, mitochondrial disease, peripheral neuropathy, pyruvate dehydrogenase...|$|E
40|$|Forensic DNA Applications: An Interdisciplinary Perspective was {{developed}} as {{an outgrowth of}} a conference held by the International Society of Applied Biological Sciences. The topic was human genome–based applications in forensic science, anthropology, and individualized medicine. Assembling the contributions of contributors from numerous regions around the world, this volume is designed as both a textbook for forensic molecular biology students and a reference for practitioners {{and those in the}} legal system. The book begins with the history and development of DNA typing and profiling for criminal and civil purposes. It discusses the statistical interpretation of results with case examples, mitochondrial DNA testing, Y single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs), and X SNP and STR testing. It also explores low copy number DNA typing, mixtures, and quality assurance and control. The second section examines the collection and preservation of biological evidence under a variety of different circumstances and the identification of human remains—including in mass disaster settings. It discusses applications to bioterrorism investigations, animal DNA testing in criminal cases, pedigree questions and wildlife forensic problems, applications in forensic entomology, and forensic botany. The third section explores recent developments and new technologies, including the rigorous identification of tissue of origin, mtDNA profiling using immobilized probe strips, chips and next-generation sequencing, the use of SNPs to ascertain phenotypic characteristics, and the 2 ̆ 2 molecular autopsy 2 ̆ 2 that looks at aspects of <b>toxicogenetics</b> and pharmacogenetics. The book concludes with a discussion on law, ethics, and policy. It examines the use of DNA evidence {{in the criminal justice system}} in both the United States and Europe, ethical issues in forensic laboratory practices, familial searches, DNA databases, ancestry searches, physical phenotyping, and report writing. The contributors also examine DNA applications in immigration and human trafficking cases and international perspectives on DNA databases...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} toxic effects of mixing cocaine with {{levamisole}} in 120 male NMRI mice, young adult stage, as pharmacological models with approximate conversion to 26 {{years in a}} human. Levamisole is a drug with immunomodulating activity and anthelmintic used in veterinary medicine and currently enrolled in a "cut" (adulterant) of cocaine in the U. S. and other countries. The {{study was conducted in}} six groups of 20 models each (cocaine alone, levamisole alone, three concentrations of the mixture and saline control) and included hematologic values, biochemical, clinical and behavioral before, during and after the experience, and pathological findings, with three concentrations of the mixture and controls. Through profiles of transaminases and creatinine are evident severe damage to the liver and kidneys. Changes in hematologic formula are indicative of damage to the immune system level, confirmed by the pathological finding of an enlarged spleen. Among the behavioral changes observed time-effect increased psychomotor activity, aggressive behavior, excessive water intake, low food intake and marked damage to skin level, leading to putrefaction of the same in Week 4 and 5 of the study. The study also allowed to observe that the mixture has a synergistic effect, enhancing the effects of cocaine on central nervous system. To confirm this assumption was sampled brain regions for further study inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters, excitatory and dopaminergic receptors. Likewise are currently underway in our research unit <b>Toxicogenetics</b> studies. Further studies are needed to assert that this association extends the half-life of cocaine, as assumed by some rapid tests performed. These early results suggest that cutting cocaine with levamisole produces severe damage to the liver, renal, immune, the most relevant of the skin damage (necrosis). This serves to alert personnel of health, treatment centers, and security of this pathology {{should not be confused with}} vasculitis or skin infections and therefore, medications that may exacerbate the clinical or enhance the effect of the mixture...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{question}} that the world is becoming increasingly toxic, with worldwide dissemination of industrial chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and radioactive elements. Many of these toxins have demonstrated harmful effects including cancer, reproductive, metabolic, and mental health effects. 1 It is also known that many toxins undergo bioaccumulation through the food chain 2 and that synergistic effects can occur whereby combinations of toxins can be more potent than the sum of individual toxins. 3 While our bodies continually undergo natural detoxification through various excretory functions, toxins are not equally distributed. Different toxins tend to accumulate in different tissues with many toxins being stored in lipid deposits where they persist and accumulate over the lifespan. 4 As there are few natural means for the excretion of fat bound toxins, it is possible that these toxins contribute to a range of disorders including the development of common cancers such as breast, prostate and leukaemias which all originate in fatty tissues. Measuring toxic load While it seems that an increasing burden of toxins is an inevitable consequence of living in the modern age, the measurement of the body's toxic load is still in its infancy. The measurement of various toxins can be performed in different body tissues including blood, urine, hair, sweat, fat, saliva, breast milk, and semen; while tests involving metabolic challenges can measure the activity of different detoxification pathways. Very few laboratories however, are set up to provide comprehensive toxin assessments and these measures are seldom performed clinically. It is also difficult to interpret their meaning, for although the signs and symptoms of overt toxicity are known for some compounds, the relationship between toxic load, clinical symptoms and disease remains uncertain. Therefore, while the science of toxicology is able to determine lethal doses and the toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics and <b>toxicogenetics</b> of different toxins, the clinical significance of ‘sub-toxic ’ doses is difficult to assess, particularly for multiple compounds. While it may be difficult to determine a person’s toxic load and its clinical significance, the concept of detoxification has a long history. Ancient medical system...|$|E
