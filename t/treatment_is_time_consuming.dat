40|$|Methylation at the 5 {{position}} of the cytosine base, when followed by guanine (CpG) in the promoter region of a protein-coding gene, is an epigenetic modification that {{has been shown to}} be involved in gene silencing. While important for regulating many normal, cellular processes, aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated in the development of human diseases such as cancer. Medical research has begun to identify hypermethylated gene promoters that can be used as predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarkers. Current technologies for DNA methylation detection, however, rely on sodium bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosine bases to urasil in the target DNA. Bisulfite <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> to perform, degrades > 90 % of the DNA, and is susceptible to incomplete conversion which can lead to false results. As such, a method that eliminates both chemical conversion and PCR amplification of DNA would enable significantly lower-cost and rapid DNA methylation analysis in the clinic. Methyl binding domain (MBD) family proteins specifically bind double-stranded, methylated DNA which makes them excellent transducers for DNA methylation in biosensing applications. I displayed three of the core members MBD 1, MBD 2, and MBD 4 on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells. Using the yeast display platform, I determined the equilibrium dissociation constant of human MBD 2 (hMBD 2) to be 5. 9 +/- 1. 3 nM for binding to singly methylated DNA. I further used the yeast display platform to evolve the hMBD 2 protein for improved binding affinity. Affecting five amino acid substitutions doubled the affinity of the wildtype protein to 3. 1 +/- 1. 0 nM. Further, concatenating the high-affinity MBD variant from 1 x to 3 x and expressing it in Escherichia coli as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion improved affinity 6 -fold for interfacial binding. After optimizing the expression and purification of engineered MBD-GFP proteins in E. coli, I developed a simple method for detecting methylated DNA fragments from the MGMT gene promoter. A defining feature is that target oligonucleotides from the test sample hybridize directly to capture probes printed in 300 pm diameter spots on an inexpensive biochip without requiring bisulfite conversion. Sub-nanomolar concentrations (0. 3 nM) of methylated DNA duplexes are detected using an MBD-GFP protein to transduce binding to either a fluorescent or colorimetric (visible hydrogel) signal formed by photopolymerization with short (< 2 min) reaction times. by Brandon Walter Heimer.

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is {{the cause}} of typhoid fever in humans. Although typhoid fever has almost {{vanished}} from developed countries, it is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Its global annual incidence has increased from 21 million cases to 26. 9 million cases during the period 2000 to 2010. Typhoid fever is curable with high dose of several antimicrobials but the <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> and expensive. Vaccines are the eventual source of prevention from typhoid fever. At present, licensed typhoid vaccines are based on Vi polysaccharides. These vaccines are not useful for children of less than 2 years of age and are ineffective against the infections caused by Vi negative S. Typhi strains. O-Specific polysaccharides (OSP) from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are universally present in both Vi positive and Vi negative S. Typhi and their conjugation with a potential immunogenic protein can make them useful for children below 2 years of age and to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response. Therefore, we planned to prepare polysaccharide-protein conjugates of Vi negative S. Typhi as potential vaccine candidates. Initially, we purified OSP from the extracted LPS of a local Vi negative S. Typhi isolate and checked its antigenicity against polyclonal mice antisera. To conjugate a carrier protein with the purified OSP, we used the recombinant exoprotein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (rEPA) and human serum albumin (HSA). For production of recombinant rEPA, full length rEPA gene was cloned in expression vector. Protein expression was optimized using different isopropyl-Ã¢-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) concentrations, various temperatures and post-induction time. The expressed protein was purified on Ni-NTA chromatography column from soluble fraction as well as from inclusion bodies. His-tag was removed from rEPA using tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Polyacrylamide gel and Western blot procedures were performed to check the purity of the protein. We synthesized four glycoconjugate vaccine candidates of Vi negative S. Typhi OSP using sodium cyanoborohydride (reductive amination) and 1 -cyano- 4 -dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP). Each of the conjugate was injected to mice on day 1, day 21 and day 42. The immune response (IgG) against prepared conjugates were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the results were interpreted by one way ANOVA using all conjugate groups vs. OSP control group. The conjugate 2 elicited significantly high (P = 0. 0001) antibody titer, while the titers produced by conjugate 1 (P = 0. 037), conjugate 3 (P = 0. 302) and conjugate 4 (P = 0. 416) were not significantly higher than that of the control group.

40|$|Periodontal disease (PD) is a {{multifactorial disease}} of the oral cavity {{affecting}} {{the majority of the}} population. Although not a direct cause of mortality, PD is a health concern because it affects {{the majority of the population}} and has a negative impact on oral health, ability to chew, appearance, quality of life, dental care costs and can lead to tooth loss. Dental plaque is a microbial biofilm, which is necessary but not sufficient for the development of periodontitis. The interactions between the biofilm and the host cells, both local tissue and immune cells, can lead to tissue destruction and ultimately tooth loss. Clinical management of periodontitis involves mechanical removal of plaque from the tooth surface. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>consuming,</b> in some patients only partially successful and recurrence is common. Therefore, understanding how the host interacts with microbial biofilms in both health and PD will help improve treatments and identify novel targets for therapeutic and preventative strategies. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the bacterial composition of oral biofilms may modulate host cell responses which contribute to the pathogenicity of PD. The overarching aim of this research was to develop an in vitro co-culture model system to study how biofilm composition can influence the host immune response. The studies document the development of health-associated, intermediate and disease-associated biofilms with host tissue and immune cells, and the use of these models to test antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds as potential treatments for PD. The biofilms developed were assessed for survival in cell culture conditions and batch reproducibility by PCR and morphology visualised using SEM. The health-associated biofilm included Streptococcus mitis, S. intermedius and S. oralis (3 -species); the intermediate biofilm additionally included Veillonella dispar, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. nucleatum spp. Vincentii (7 -species); and the disease-associated biofilm included further addition of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (10 -species). These biofilms were co-cultured with an oral epithelial cell line and primary gingival epithelial cells, as well as neutrophils and a myeloid cell line. Host cell viability was assessed by AlamarBlue®/LDH and changes in mRNA and protein expression of chemokines and cytokines were assessed by quantitative PCR and ELISA/Luminex®, respectively. Cellular responses were further evaluated by microscopy and flow cytometry. Generally, co-culture of health associated biofilms with host cells resulted in minimal impact on cell viability and generally low inflammatory gene expression and protein release, with some genes including CXCL 5 and CCL 1 being downregulated compared to the cells only control. Intermediate biofilms caused some cell death and a marked upregulation of inflammatory genes and protein release, including a 302. 7 fold increase of epithelial cell IL- 8 gene expression compared to the cells only control. These intermediate biofilms elicited significant upregulation of CD 40 and CD 69 expression on the monocyte cell line compared with untreated controls. Co-culture of the 10 species disease associated biofilms with host cells resulted in significant host cell death of both epithelial cells and monocytes. The 10 species biofilm caused significantly increased pro-inflammatory gene expression, but only low levels of protein could be detected in the supernatants. Similar trends in upregulation of inflammatory gene expression but low levels of protein release was observed in co-culture with differentiated pro-monocytes, whereas upregulation of inflammatory gene expression and protein release in neutrophil co-cultures was observed. The effect of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds, resveratrol and chlorhexidine, was evaluated using this model system. Prior treatment of epithelial cells with resveratrol and biofilm with chlorhexidine significantly reduced IL- 8 release from epithelial cells in co-culture with biofilms for 4 and 24 hours. In conclusion, this research has developed and validated 3 complex multi-species biofilms to study host: biofilm interactions in vitro. Furthermore, using these models in co-culture with multiple host cell types, clear differences in the host response to different biofilms were observed. The variations in inflammatory response of host cells and oral biofilms observed in this study help further understanding of the complex host: biofilm interactions within the oral cavity which contribute to PD. This model demonstrated its potential as a platform to test novel actives, highlighting its use a tool to study how actives can influence host: biofilm interactions within the oral cavity. Future use of this model will aid in greater understanding of host: biofilm interactions. Such findings are applicable to oral health and beyond, and may help to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD and other biofilm associated diseases...|$|E

Recent research demonstrated that gum chewing has beneficial effects on cognition including certain aspects of attention. Therefore, gum chewing may benefit children with ADHD in situations requiring particular cognitive efforts. In a crossover study, attentional functioning of 32 children with ADHD and 32 children without the condition was examined. All participants were assessed with chewing gum and without chewing gum. A computerized test was used for the assessment of vigilance and sustained attention. The findings of the present study suggest that gum chewing during task execution has detrimental effects on vigilance of both healthy children and children with ADHD. Sustained attention was not affected by gum chewing. Chewing gum, therefore, appears not to improve attentional performance in children with ADHD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The detection of thinning of articular cartilage provides a good support for the diagnosis of OA in its early stage.

In this Master’s Thesis we propose an interactive segmentation framework for the semi automatic segmentation of articular cartilage.

30|$|In {{the western}} world, the {{majority}} of displaced femoral diaphyseal fractures are treated operatively using intramedullary nails (IMNs) with early return to function and a low incidence of complications [1]. When femoral non-unions do occur, the <b>treatment</b> options can <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>consuming,</b> challenging and expensive. Based upon a health economics study from the UK, the cost of treating a femoral non-union is at least £ 17, 000 (US $ 22, 000) per patient [2]. From the patients’ perspective, femoral non-unions result in on-going pain, altered gait, delayed return to work and psychosocial impairment. Therefore, treatment methods that improve the likelihood of fracture union combined with a reduced “time-to-union” are welcomed by clinicians and patients alike. Currently the most common method of treating femoral diaphyseal non-unions is to perform an exchange-nailing procedure, whereby the original IM nail is removed, and the femoral canal is reamed to stimulate the natural healing response. Reaming permits a larger diameter IMN to be inserted thus improving the mechanical stability. Despite this exchange, IM nailing is not as uniformly successful and persistent non-unions do occur.|$|R

40|$|Aim. Chronic venous ulcer <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> often <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> and {{requires}} {{a high degree}} of compliance from the patient. This derives not only from venous hypertension but also from chronic structural and metabolic changes of underlying tissues which impair the healing process. It therefore becomes necessary to improve the ulcer tissue condition in order to accelerate the healing process. This is obtained mainly with the improvement of local haemodynamics and secondly by direct action on the ulcer. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment with a pedunculated flap of fascia as an additional treatment of chronic venous ulcer. Methods. Four patients classified C 6 according to the CEAP classification were treated for chronic venous ulcer with correction of venous hypertension (saphenectomy or ligature of incompetent perforating veins). The patients also underwent rotation of a fascial pedunculated flap transferred from the sural area to the perimalleolar area. After 7 - 15 days they had a free skin graft in the treated area. Results. All patients were discharged on the 3 rd postoperative day after the flap rotation. In 3 patients the ulcer healed within 30 days and in a 4 th patient within 45 days. No recurrence was observed. Conclusion. With this method the healing <b>time</b> seems to <b>be</b> shortened compared to the typical evolution in patients treated with only reflux control followed by conservative therapy. Associating fascial flap in the treatment of chronic venous ulcers improves the bed on which the free skin graft is applied. We can also hypothesize that this procedure restores the aponeurotic barrier between deep venous circulation and superficial microcirculation with the ensuing improvement in local venous hypertension...|$|R
50|$|The {{coupling}} of chromatography with MS is a {{well developed}} chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. Gas chromatography (GC) - MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques. In GC, the analytes are eluted from the separation column as a gas and the connection with electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) ion sources in the MS system was a technically simpler challenge. Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s. The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was {{directly related to the}} development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources. A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of GC-MS and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary {{was one of the main}} issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes.

Designing {{a high quality}} IMRT/VMAT <b>treatment</b> plan <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>consuming.</b> Different kinds of knowledge-based methods are being developed to reduce planning time and improve the plan quality by extracting knowledge from previous expert plans to form knowledge models and applying such models to the new patient cases. Currently, these methods are mostly limited to a particular cancer type and therefore various diseases types require training of multiple knowledge models {{with a large number}} of cases. To investigate the feasibility of knowledge modeling of IMRT/VMAT treatment planning for multiple cancer types, a progressive study is conducted with a treatment planning knowledge model that quantifies correlations between patient pelvic anatomical features and the OAR sparing features. Low risk prostate plans with relatively simpler PTV-OAR geometry, which is the most common geometry type in previous knowledge based studies, are used to train the model as the starting point of the progressive modeling process. Cases with more complex PTV-OAR anatomies (prostate cancer cases with lymph node irradiation, and anal rectal cancer cases) are added to the training dataset one by one until the model prediction accuracies reach plateau. The DVHs predicted by the knowledge model for bladder, femoral heads and rectum are validated by cases from all three types of cases. Dosimetric parameters are extracted from the predicted DVHs and the corresponding actual plan values measure the prediction accuracy of this multi-disease type model. Further, its accuracy was also compared with the models trained by single disease type cases (including low risk prostate cancer, or type 1, high risk prostate cancer with lymph nodes, or type 2 and anal rectal cancer, or type 3). Prediction accuracy reaches plateau when 6 high risk prostate cancer with lymph nodes irradiation cases and 8 anal rectal cancer cases were added to the training dataset. The determination coefficients R 2 for the OARs are: Bladder: 0. 90, rectum: 0. 64 and femoral heads: 0. 82. The prediction accuracies by the multi-disease type model and single-disease type models have no significant differences by F-test (p-value: bladder: 0. 58, femoral head: 0. 44, rectum: 0. 97). Conclusion: Progressive knowledge modeling of OAR sparing for multiple cancer types in in the pelvic region is feasible and has comparable accuracy to single-disease type modeling. Thesi...|$|R

Some isothermal aging treatments in the critical temperature range have also been carried out. Results of a Charpy V impact test on not-aged and aged specimens, and observation of the fracture surfaces led to the following conclusions: the steel does not undergo temper embrittlement upon step cooling treatment or after aging at different temperatures and times in the critical temperature range; the most negative effect on the shift of the ductile-to-brittle transition curve—compared with not aged steel—has been observed after aging at 593 °C for 2 h (ΔT 54 J = 9 °C); further aging up to 8 h produced a ΔT 54 J of only 1 °C.

The IgY against P. gingivalis 122 k-hemagglutinin A, {{which was one of}} the virulence factors of P. gingivalis could be useful in assessing the treatment of periodontal diseases induced by P. gingivalis (Tagawa et al. 2004). Anti- 130 k haemagglutinin IgY significantly inhibited P. gingivalis-associated haemagglutinating activity (Hamajima et al. 2007). P. gingivalis were able to evade immune surveillance and avoid clearance, which facilitates local invasions of periodontal tissues; while the host also generated immune responses to the bacterial challenge, which contributed to a bactericidal effect but may also lead to periodontal destruction (Ke et al. 2016), which may develop into periodontitis and halitosis.

A radiotherapy treatment plan needs to be created to deliver a sufficient radiation dose to cancerous cells while sparing nearby organs at risk and healthy tissue. The development of such a <b>treatment</b> plan <b>is</b> a <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> trial and error process which can take from a few hours up to a few days. This thesis builds on the previously developed Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system for radiotherapy treatment planning for brain cancer that was developed in collaboration with Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, City Hospital Campus, UK. The original CBR system focused on the retrieval stage of CBR, where the most similar case was retrieved for the new patient case. The results obtained were promising but adaptation needed to be performed {{for them to be}} suitable for the new patient. Testing of the CBR system by medical physicists has revealed that some of the retrieved radiation beams were not suitable for the tumour position of the new cases and thus could not be used. To avoid this the clustering of cases by their tumour positions was implemented to only retrieve cases with similar tumour positions. The revised CBR system should now retrieve treatment plans with better suited beams. Adaptation requires a lot of domain knowledge which is often difficult to acquire. In this research we present adaptation approaches which are knowledge-light, i. e. they utilise knowledge available in the case base without requiring interaction with medical experts. Adaptation methods based on machine learning algorithms, in particular neural networks, the naive Bayes classifier, and support vector machines, were developed. Also, an adaptation-guided retrieval approach is presented, in which the case is retrieved only if it can be adapted. In addition, a pair of similar cases are retrieved with it, which guide the adaptation process. The developed knowledge-light adaptation methods have improved the results of the original CBR system. In addition, the proposed adaptation methods are general and could be used in domains where the available amount of knowledge is limited...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMycosis Fungoides (MF) is an {{indolent}} {{lymphoproliferative disorder}} affecting dermis caused by abnormal proliferation of CD 4 + T-cells. Radiation therapy {{is the most}} effective modality of treatment for MF which offers cure in limited stage disease and desirable palliation in advance stage disease. Treating entire skin having many curved surfaces and folds with radiation is the real challenge for the radiation oncologist. Many techniques, dose schedules and modifications in total skin electron irradiation (TSEI) have been tried since 1950 s. TSEI <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> a very <b>time</b> <b>consuming,</b> inconvenient and physically challenging to both patient as well as oncologist. AimAt our center TSEI was performed since 1983 with conventional linear accelerator where the <b>treatment</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> prolonged beyond two hours, which was very difficult or the patient, oncologist, technical officer and eating away the machine time hampering the treatment of other patients. From 1998 we shifted to high dose rate (HDR) mode, in order to bring down the treatment time of a single patient every day from two and half hour to 15 min. The reduction of treatment time increases patient compliance {{and at the same time}} saved machine time. Materials and methodsBetween 1998 and 2003, eleven pathological diagnosed MF patients were treated using HDR TSEI. All the patients were male between 40 and 70 years of age, who had the history of having the disease for 7 – 22 months. Four patients had T 2 and seven patients had T 3 stage disease with more than 90 % skin surface involvement. TSEI was performed with 4 MeV electrons with a daily fraction size of 120 cGy to a total dose of 36 Gy. At the end of 36 Gy, boost dose of 10 Gy was delivered to self shielding regions like sole, scalp and perineum. Considering the treatment related toxicities and consequent treatment interruptions, in the first seven patients, the last four patients were treated using similar HDR TSEI technique with modified treatment schedule, where the <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> given on an alternate day basis following 2 nd week of initiation of <b>treatment.</b> ResultsThe patients <b>were</b> followed over a period of 144 months with a median of 72 months. Nine patients are alive without any evidence of disease, one patient relapsed and one died due to progression of disease. The most common radiation related morbidities are erythema, skin blisters, various degree of desquamations, swelling of joints (specially small joints) etc. which <b>are</b> controlled by <b>treatment</b> interruptions and conservative measures. By modifying the treatment schedule, the incidence of toxicity as well as <b>treatment</b> interruptions <b>were</b> brought down. ConclusionsWe can conclude that HDR-TSEI is an excellent and safe therapeutic modality for the patients with MF both curative as well as palliative without any added toxicity profile, provided patient positioning is done properly...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increase}} in the solid residue of wastewater treatment plants due to population growth and tightening environmental regulation. Anaerobic digestion process in the wastewater <b>treatment</b> plants <b>is</b> a <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> process which takes several days to be completed. Thermal pre-treatment of sludge before anaerobic digestion c{{an increase}} the access of microorganisms to organic matter which will result in improving the digestion process. This treatment, however, causes rheological and compositional changes in sludge which needs to be understood. To optimise the hydrodynamics of the anaerobic digesters, determination of rheological properties of thermally treated sludge is required. This study investigates the effect of temperature and thermal history in the range of 50 - 80 &deg;C for 1 h on the rheology and composition of digested sludge and waste activated sludge (WAS). The range of temperature and <b>time</b> <b>were</b> selected 50 - 80 &deg;C and 1 - 60 min, firstly, because it ensures that the compositional changes in sludge are as a result of thermal treatment and solubilisation phenomenon and not digestion by microorganisms. Secondly, the thermal treatment of sludge for several days may not be economical in the large scale. First, the flow curve, yield stress and composition (indicated by sCOD) of 2 % TS digested sludge were measured before, after and during the thermal treatment. The results showed a significant irreversible decrease in apparent viscosity and yield stress with an increase in temperature and treatment time. Also, the result showed an increase in soluble COD with an increase in temperature and <b>treatment</b> <b>time.</b> It <b>was</b> hypothesised that the rheological changes induced by thermal treatment occur as a result of organic matter solubilisation indicated by COD analysis. An irreversible increase in sludge liquor viscosity after thermal treatment confirmed this hypothesis. Second, the sludge flow curves at different concentrations, temperatures and duration of thermal <b>treatment</b> <b>were</b> scalable which resulted in developing a master curve to encapsulate all variables. The release of soluble COD (rsCOD) followed a power-logarithmic function of thermal treatment time in the range of temperature studied. The dimensionless yield stress and infinite viscosity were shown to have the same power-logarithmic relationship with treatment time too. A linear relationship was then found between the rsCOD and dimensionless yield stress as well as the rsCOD and dimensionless infinite viscosity. Third, the hypothesis was tested and confirmed for WAS within 3 - 8. 3 % TS thermally treated at 50 - 80 &deg;C. It was confirmed that the rsCOD followed power-logarithmic relationship with treatment time regardless of sludge type. Similarly, linear relationships were found between the rsCOD and dimensionless yield stress as well as rsCOD and dimensionless infinite viscosity for thermally-treated WAS. It was suggested that the thermal treatment of sludge breaks down the secondary bonds in sludge flocs and releases polysaccharides, proteins and bound water which modify the rheology. Fourth, a linear relationship was also found between rsCOD and dimensionless moduli of sludge in the linear viscoelastic regime. It was also shown that a real-time rheological measurement of complex moduli during the thermal <b>treatment</b> could <b>be</b> used for the estimation of changes in rsCOD...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. In the first one the {{creation}} of a complete numerical tool, from the mesh generation to the data <b>treatment,</b> <b>is</b> presented. However <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> this part has been, this is not the most important one. The second and more important part is concerned with the description and physical interpretation of the results obtained with the numerical tool previously developed. The numerical tool, which exists in its quasi-final version since mid- 1997, fully satisfies the following requirements. It is specifically designed to study the flow in the annular space between coaxial, differentially-rotating cylinders of finite length. The spectral element method is used for the space discretization. The study of transition requires the high accuracy warranted by this type of method. The numerical scheme has also to be efficient. This requirement is satisfied, due to the fully-explicit time scheme adopted, where both diffusive and non-linear terms of the Navier-Stokes equations are treated explicitly, and the direct inversion of the pseudo-Laplacian matrix applied to the pressure. This inversion is performed in the most efficient way with a fast diagonalization technique. In the Reynolds numbers range we are interested in, the time-step limitation due to the linear viscous term is only slightly more stringent than the one due to the non-linear term. The last requirement that has been fulfilled has been to design as simple a code as possible. The entire code is constructed from a number of well-known algorithms, fitted together to enhance efficiency. However, the way we regularize the boundary conditions is new. It represents the physics more precisely than Tavener et al. [65]. There is a second original feature in our code, which is linked to the time scheme. We derived our time discretization from the scheme of Gavrilakis et al. [31]. Their scheme cannot be applied to cylindrical coordinates as it is. We thus had to modify it. The second part of the thesis consists of the numerical study of the first transitions of the Taylor-Couette flow in a finite-length geometry. The aspect ratio between the length of the cylinders and the gap between them has been chosen equal to twelve; this is small enough for the effects of the upper and lower boundaries of the flow to be significant. It is believed that these end-effects play a non-negligible role in the transition of the flow. On the other hand, the aspect ratio is large enough to make qualitative comparisons with the infinite-length case, which has been studied extensively both theoretically and numerically. The transition process depends on a relatively large number of parameters. Our investigation focuses on the case where the cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The study of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow for a large but finite aspect ratio is the main originality of this thesis. Furthermore, the physical mechanism of the appearance of the second bifurcation in classical Taylor-Couette flow, where only the inner cylinder is rotating, is described {{in the light of the}} non-linear interaction between velocity and vorticity...|$|R
