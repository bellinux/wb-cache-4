Surgery to place an orbital implant leaves little or no scarring and the recovery period is usually brief. Hopefully, the surgery will provide a permanent cure, but sometimes it provides only partial relief from double vision or a sunken eye. Reconstruction is usually performed with a <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> or porous polyethylene through a transconjunctival or subciliary incision.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of fibronectin and collagen I coatings on <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow cells. Three main treatment groups were investigated in addition to uncoated <b>titanium</b> fiber meshes: <b>meshes</b> coated with fibronectin, meshes coated with collagen I, and meshes coated first with collagen I and then subsequently with fibronectin. Rat bone marrow cells were cultured for 1, 4, 8, and 16 days in plain and coated <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>meshes.</b> In addition, a portion of each of these coating treatment groups was cultured in the presence of antibodies against fibronectin and collagen I integrins. To evaluate cellular proliferation and differentiation, constructs were examined for DNA, osteocalcin, and calcium content and alkaline phosphatase activity. There were no significant effects of the coatings on cellular proliferation as indicated by the DNA quantification analysis. When antibodies against fibronectin and collagen I integrins were used, a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) in cell proliferation was observed for the uncoated <b>titanium</b> <b>meshes,</b> meshes coated with collagen, and meshes coated with collagen and fibronectin. The different coatings also did not affect the alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells seeded on the coated meshes. However, the presence of antibodies against fibronectin or collagen I integrins resulted in significantly delayed expression of alkaline phosphatase activity for uncoated <b>titanium</b> <b>meshes,</b> meshes coated with collagen, and meshes coated with collagen and fibronectin. Calcium measurements did not reveal a significant effect of fibronectin or collagen I coating on calcium deposition in the meshes. Also, no difference in calcium content was observed in the uncoated <b>titanium</b> <b>meshes</b> and meshes coated with fibronectin when antibodies against fibronectin or collagen I integrins were present. Meshes coated with both collagen I and fibronectin showed significantly higher calcium content when cultured in the presence of antibodies to collagen and fibronectin integrins. A similar phenomenon was also observed for collagen-coated meshes cultured in the presence of antibodies to fibronectin integrins. No significant differences in osteocalcin content were observed between the treatment groups. However, all groups exposed to antibodies against fibronectin integrins showed a significant decrease in osteocalcin content on day 16. These results show that a fibronectin or collagen I coating does not stimulate the differentiation of rat bone marrow cells seeded in a <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on bone {{formation}} {{was investigated in}} a rabbit segmental radial defect model. The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the bone inductive properties of PRP with <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> and autologous bone chips in a 15 -mm rabbit radial defect model. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: I, PRP with autologous bone (PRP-Ti-Bone); II, autologous bone (Ti-Bone); III, control group (Ti). The implants were placed in the radial defect for 12 weeks. After sacrifice, all specimens were harvested for histological, histomorphometrical and radiographic analysis. Histomorphometrical analysis showed that bone formation was higher in the implants with PRP (PRP-Ti-Bone: 37 +/- 8 %) than in those without PRP (Ti-bone: 25 +/- 6 % and Ti: 25 +/- 5 %) after 12 weeks of implantation. It was concluded that PRP has a stimulatory effect on bone formation in <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> filled with autologous bone graft in segmental bone defects. <b>Titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> was also shown to be an excellent scaffold material for the application of autologous bone grafts with or without PRP...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the ability of peptide-coated {{surfaces}} to influence cell responses in vivo. Many studies have demonstrated that peptide-modified surfaces influence cell responses in vitro. Integrins, which bind specifically short peptide sequences, are responsible for these cell responses. In this way, information can be transmitted to the nucleus through several cytoplasmic signaling pathways. The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD peptide) {{plays an important role in}} osteoblast adhesion. The present study was designed to investigate new bone formation in a porous <b>titanium</b> (Ti) fiber <b>mesh</b> implant, which was coated with cyclic RGD peptide. The RGD-Ti implants were inserted into the cranium of a rabbit and were compared with porous <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> disks without RGD sequence (Ti) and with an open control defect. Histologic and histomorphometric examinations were performed 2, 4, and 8 weeks postoperatively. A significant increase in bone formation, or bone ingrowth, was seen in the RGD-Ti group compared with the Ti group after 4 and 8 weeks. All control defects stayed open in all three periods. It was concluded that the use of cyclic RGD peptide in combination with <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> has a positive effect on bone formation in vivo in a rabbit animal model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> {{scaffolds}} {{have been}} shown to be a suitable material for culture of primary marrow stromal cells in an effort to create tissue engineered constructs for bone tissue replacement. In native bone tissue, these cells are known to attach to extracellular matrix molecules via integrin receptors for specific peptide sequences, and these attachments can be a source of cell signaling, affecting cell behaviors such as differentiation. In this study, we examined the ability of primary rat marrow stromal cells at two different stages of osteoblastic differentiation to further differentiate into osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo when seeded on <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> scaffolds either with or without RGD peptide tethered to the surface. In vitro, the tethered RGD peptide resulted in reduced initial cell proliferation. In vivo, there was no effect of tethered RGD peptide on ectopic bone formation in a rat subcutaneous implant model. Scaffold/cell constructs exposed to dexamethasone for 4 days prior to implantation (+dex constructs) resulted in significant bone formation whereas no bone formation was observed in [...] dex constructs. These results show that the osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells was not dependent on surface tethered RGD peptide, and that the initial differentiation stage of implanted cells plays an important role in bone formation in <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> bone tissue engineering constructs...|$|R
5000|$|For this procedure, {{there are}} two ways to start: with a free graft repair or with a vascularized flap repair. The free grafts use {{secondary}} material like cadaver flaps or <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> to repair the skull base defects, which is very successful (95% without CSF leaks) with small CSF fistulas or small defects. [...] The local or regional vascularized flaps are pieces of tissue relatively close to the surgery site that have been mostly freed up but are still attached to the original tissue. These flaps are then stretched or maneuvered onto the desired location. When technology advanced and larger defects could be fixed endoscopically, more and more failures and leaks started to occur with the free graft technique. The larger defects are associated with a wider dural removal and an exposure to high flow CSF, which could be the reason for failure among the free graft.|$|E

All patients {{were divided into two}} groups, including pre-shaped <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implantation group(observation group), 40 cases, conventional <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implantation group(control group), 32 cases. The control group was treated by physicians according to the experience of manual bending and shaping <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implantation ipsilateral orbital pad,when the observation group by the physicians directly in the pre-shaped <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> of 3 D printing. The eyeball exophthalmos, eye movement and diplopia were evaluated in the next 1, 3 and 6 mo after the operation, and we compared {{the differences between the two}} methods at different time points and the differences of the indexes between the two materials at the same time point. RESULTS: The cure rate of the observation group and the control group about eyeball exophthalmos values was 84 % and 59 %, the difference of the two groups was statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). The cure rate of limited ocular movement of observation group was 73 %, that of control group was 66 %, there was no statistical significance(P> 0. 05).

The IrO 2 /TNPs electrode has ordered microstructure and more porous surface morphology than that of IrO 2 /Ti electrode. The electrochemical tests showed that IrO 2 /TNPs electrode exhibited higher catalytic activity than IrO 2 /Ti electrode. And the cell voltage can be as low as 1. 16 V at 1000 mA cm(- 2) and 70 degrees C, which is 90 mV lower than that of the cell with IrO 2 /Ti electrode (1. 25 V). The increase in performance is attributed to the ordered microstructure and porous surface which decrease the interface contact resistance and charge transfer resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the space-maintaining {{capacity of a}} <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> or a bioresorbable mesh after periosteal expansion and to assess bone formation under a <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> or a bioresorbable mesh on the lateral border of the mandible by qualitative and quantitative histological analysis. Material and methods: In 13 rabbits, a self-inflatable soft tissue expander was placed intraorally, bilaterally under the mandibular periosteum via an extra oral approach. After 2 weeks, the expanders were removed and a particulated onlay bone graft was placed and covered by a <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> or a bioresorbable mesh. After 3 months, the animals were sacrificed and specimens were collected for histology. Results: The osmotic soft tissue expander created a subperiosteal pocket and a ridge of new bone had formed {{at the edges of}} the expanded periosteum in all sites. After the healing period of 3 months, soft tissue dehiscence was recorded in two of the sites with bioresorbable meshes. The mean bone fill was 65 % under the <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> and 85 % under the bioresorbable mesh (P< 0. 05). There was no significant difference between the <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> and the bioresorbable mesh regarding the height of the meshes, mesh area and mineralized bone area. Scanning electron microscopy shows that new bone is growing in direct contact with the resorbable mesh and the <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh.</b> Conclusion: This study confirms that an osmotic soft tissue expander creates a surplus of periosteum and soft tissue and that new bone can be generated under a <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> or bioresorbable mesh...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{present a}} method of {{repairing}} orbital floor fractures using pre-shaped <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implants that were formed on templates designed {{on the basis of}} computed tomography images by MIMICS. METHODS: Ten patients with simple unilateral inferior orbital wall fracture were included in this study. All patients underwent transconjunctival repair of isolated orbital floor fractures. First, 3 D virtual models and then 2 D models with fracture areas were created on the basis of computed tomography images using MIMICS software. These 2 D models were printed on the papers in real size and then sterilized as templates to shape the <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> and which were then used in the reconstruction of orbital floor defects. Within 3 days after surgery, the orbits were then scanned by spiral CT to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of preformed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implants. RESULTS: CT scans reveal that the preformed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> implants had great accuracy to reconstruct the orbital floor defects in all patients. Significant improvement resulted in 1 case with respect to diplopia and enophthalmos and total recovery in 9 cases.

40|$|Two surface-reactive sol-gel coatings, namely titania (TiO 2) and {{a mixture}} of titania and silica (TiSi), were applied to <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>meshes.</b> Differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells toward an osteogenic {{phenotype}} with coated and uncoated (cpTi) substrates was compared. The amount of DNA in cpTi and TiSi matrices did not increase after day 3, but with TiO 2 matrices the amount increased for 7 days. The prolonged period of proliferation with TiO 2 scaffolds resulted in a delay in alkaline phosphatase induction. However, osteocalcin incorporation into extracellular matrix by day 14 was greater with TiO 2 scaffolds than with cpTi scaffolds. Calcium deposition was also greater with TiO 2 -coated substrates than with uncoated substrates. With the TiSi scaffolds osteocalcin production and mineralization were lower than with the cpTi scaffolds. The current study confirms our previous findings that <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> supports attachment, growth, and differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. Furthermore, the osteogenic capacities of cell-scaffold constructs under cell culture conditions were increased with a sol-gel-derived titania coating, but not with a titania-silica coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to learn more about the effect of seeding and loading techniques on the osteogenic differentiation in vitro of rat bone marrow cells into <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh.</b> This material was used as received or subjected to glow discharge treatment (RFGD). The seeding methods that were used included a so-called droplet, cell suspension (high and low cell density), and rotating plate method. Osteogenic cells were cultured for 4, 8, and 16 days into <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh.</b> DNA, osteocalcin, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and calcium measurements were used to determine cellular proliferation and differentiation. DNA analysis of the differently seeded specimens showed that proliferation proceeded faster in the first versus second run for droplet and cell suspension samples. No clear and distinct additional effect was found when RFGD treatment was used. Statistical analyses revealed that high cell density and low rotational speed resulted always in a significantly higher DNA content. Calcium measurements and osteocalcin analysis showed that using high cell densities during inoculation of the scaffolds prevented the occurrence of differences between experimental runs. SEM examination showed that for droplet and cell suspension samples cells were present at only one side of the mesh. The mesh side where the cell sheet was observed depended on the additional use of glow discharge treatment. On these materials, the cells had penetrated through the meshes and formed a cell sheet at the bottom side. When rotation was used, no cell sheet was formed and cells had invaded the meshes and were growing around the titanium fibers. On the basis of our results, we conclude that (1). <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> is indeed suitable to support the osteogenic expression of bone marrow cells, and (2). changing the initial cell density as well as the use of dynamic seeding methods can influence the osteogenic capacity of the scaffold...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Titanium (Ti) and its alloys {{have been}} widely used in {{orthopedic}} and dental applications. The bonding between Ti implants and tissues is significantly important in the clinical applications, which is highly relative to the characteristics of implant surface with surface improvement by various coatings such as hydroxyapatite (HA). Meanwhile, the characteristics of modified implants surface can induce special biological response of osteogenic cells to improve the bone-implant bonding. In this paper, in order to improve Ti bioactivity and enhance its osteointegration, calcium phosphate (CaP) /titanate coatings were prepared on Ti with nano-scale surface topographies by a two-step hydrothermal process. Firstly, <b>titanium</b> <b>meshes</b> were treated in sodium hydroxide solutions at two temperatures (200 °C or 240 °C). Then, the treated meshes were immersed in calcium phosphate solutions containing various concentrations of cyclohexane-hexacarboxylic acid (H 6 L) under hydrothermal conditions. After this two-step process, calcium phosphate deposits, confirmed to be apatite/titanate by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, were successfully formed on the treated Ti mesh surface. These results suggested that this two-step hydrothermal method can be successfully applied to fabricate robust and hierarchical nanostructured coatings of CaP/titanate on Ti implants. 1...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{preliminary}} study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a customized, three-dimensional, preformed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> as a barrier membrane for peri-implant alveolar bone regeneration. Materials and Methods: Ten patients were recruited for this study. At the time of implant placement, all patients had fenestration or a dehiscence defect around the implant fixture. A mixture of particulate intraoral autologous bone and freeze-dried bone allograft was applied to the defect in a 1 : 1 volume ratio and covered by the preformed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh.</b> A core biopsy specimen was taken from the regenerated bone four months postoperatively.

40|$|In {{this study}} we report on direct {{involvement}} of fluid shear stresses on the osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells. Rat bone marrow stromal cells were seeded in 3 D porous <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> scaffolds and cultured for 16 days in a flow perfusion bioreactor with perfusing culture media of different viscosities while maintaining the fluid flow rate constant. This methodology allowed exposure of the cultured cells to increasing levels of mechanical stimulation, {{in the form of}} fluid shear stress, whereas chemotransport conditions for nutrient delivery and waste removal remained essentially constant. Under similar chemotransport for the cultured cells in the 3 D porous scaffolds, increasing fluid shear forces led to increased mineral deposition, suggesting that the mechanical stimulation provided by fluid shear forces in 3 D flow perfusion culture can indeed enhance the expression of the osteoblastic phenotype. Increased fluid shear forces also resulted in the generation of a better spatially distributed extracellular matrix inside the porosity of the 3 D <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> scaffolds.

A total of 16 constructs from each one of the six treatment groups were then implanted into an 8 -mm critical size calvarial defect created in the cranium of adult syngeneic male Fisher rats. Half of the constructs from each group were retrieved 7 days postimplantation, and the other half of the constructs were retrieved 30 days postimplantation and examined for new bone formation and tissue response. Constructs retrieved 7 days postimplantation were filled with fibrous tissue and capillaries, but no bone formation was observed in any of the six treatment groups. Constructs retrieved 30 days postimplantation showed bone formation (at least 7 out of 8 constructs in all treatment groups). <b>Titanium</b> fiber <b>meshes</b> seeded with bone marrow stromal osteoblasts and cultured for 1 day under flow perfusion conditions before implantation appeared to give the highest percentage of bone formation per implant (64 +/- 17 %).

METHODS:Sixty-seven patients(67 eyes) diagnosed as infraorbital fracture from January 2011 to February 2014 were performed reconstruction with individually performed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh.</b> The recovery of incision, visual acuity, eyeball mobility, diplopia and proptosis were monitored by post-operation follow-up which lasted for 1 a. RESULTS:No infection, <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> transposition, prolapse, deformities, exclusion or ectropion were {{occurred in the}} follow-up period. The eyeball embole was less than 2 mm by bilateral proptosis contrast. The diplopia in 5 eyes were disappeared in 4 and approved in one. The eyeball descent in 2 cases was disappeared. The visual acuity was the same compared with pre-operation. The rate of disappeared diplopia at primary position was 93 % and improved significantly in the other 3 patients. The rate of disappeared diplopia at peripheral visual field was 86 % and improved significantly in the other 2 patients. CONCLUSION:The reconstruction effect of individually performed <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> in infraorbital wall fracture was satisfied and safe...|$|E
40|$|A novel tubular cathode for {{the direct}} {{methanol}} fuel cell (DMFC) is proposed, {{based on a}} tubular <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh.</b> A dip-coating method has been developed for its fabrication. The tubular cathode is composed of <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh,</b> a cathode diffusion layer, a catalyst layer, and a recast Nafion film. The <b>titanium</b> <b>mesh</b> is present at the inner circumference of the diffusion layer, while the recast Nafion(R) film is at the outer circumference of the catalyst layer. A DMFC single cell with a 3. 5 mgPt cm(- 2) tubular cathode was able to perform as well, in terms of power density, as a conventional planar DMFC. A peak power density of 9 mW cm(- 2) was reached under atmospheric air at 25 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare titania (TiO(2)) -coated, titania-silica (TiSi) -coated, and {{uncoated}} (cpTi) <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>meshes</b> as scaffolds for bone engineering. The scaffolds were loaded with bone marrow stromal cells and implanted subcutaneously in rats. Ectopic bone formation after 1, 4, and 12 weeks of implantation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. After 1 week of implantation, multiple patches of unorganized mineralizing tissue were seen in all implants. The amount of this bone-like tissue clearly increased from 1 to 4 weeks. Bone apposition occurred in direct contact with coated meshes, while a thin layer of unmineralized fibrous tissue was often observed surrounding cpTi mesh fibers. After 12 weeks, the structure of bone, with bone marrow-like tissue, was further matured and mesh fibers were embedded in lamellar bone. No statistical differences in the amount of mineralized bone were observed between scaffold types at any point of time. Only TiSi scaffolds showed further increase in bone area from 4 to 12 weeks (p < 0. 01). A notable difference was that the sol-gel coatings resulted in enhanced initial bone contact and distribution of bone tissue, whereas uncoated implants showed bone formation mainly in the center of the scaffolds. In conclusion, TiO(2) -based sol-gel coatings may be used in tissue engineering to gain more uniform distribution of bone throughout <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> scaffolds...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of cell culture time on bone formation by rat bone marrow cells seeded in <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh.</b> As a seeding technique, a high cell suspension was used (3 x 10 (6) cells/mL). Therefore, 30 meshes were repeatedly rotated in a 10 mL tube (containing 30 x 10 (6) cells) on a rotation plate (2 rpm) for 3 h. Osteogenic cells were cultured for 1, 4, and 8 days on <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> and finally implanted subcutaneously in rats. Meshes without cells were also implanted subcutaneously in rats. DNA and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses and calcium measurements determined cellular proliferation and differentiation during the in vitro incubation period of the mesh implants. Four weeks after implant insertion, the animals were sacrificed. The implants, with their surrounding tissue, were retrieved and prepared for histologic evaluation and calcium measurements. DNA analysis of the in vitro experiment showed a lag phase from day 1 through day 4, but a 42 % increase in DNA between days 4 and 8. SEM and calcium measurements indicated an increase in calcium from day 1 to day 4, yet only a small but significant increase from days 4 to 8. Histologic analysis demonstrated that bone was formed in all day 1 and day 4 implants, and that the bone-like tissue was present uniformly through the meshes. The bony tissue was morphologically characterized by osteocytes embedded in a mineralized matrix, with a layer of osteoid and osteoblasts at the surface. The day 8 implants showed only calcium phosphate deposition in the <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh.</b> Calcium measurements of the implants revealed that calcification in day 1 implants was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) compared to day 4 and day 8 implants. No significant difference in calcium content existed between day 4 and day 8 implants. On the basis of our results, we conclude that 1) bone formation was generated more effectively in osteogenic cells by a short culture time after seeding in titanium fiber mesh; 2) dynamic cell seeding is probably more effective than static cell seeding; and 3) selection of the right cells from the heterogenous bone marrow population remains a problem...|$|R
30|$|Cell-derived ECM {{has been}} {{fabricated}} into three-dimensional scaffolds or reconstituted with scaffolds for tissue engineering applications (Liao et al. 2010; Wolchok and Tresco 2010; Lu et al. 2011). It {{has been shown}} that osteoblastic ECM deposited on <b>titanium</b> fiber <b>mesh</b> scaffolds induces osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in static culture (Datta et al. 2005). In three-dimensional scaffold, osteoblast-ECM promotes osteogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells and improves osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells (Datta et al. 2005; Pham et al. 2008), and supports adhesion, growth, and ECM production of osteoblasts in vitro (Tour et al. 2011).|$|R
