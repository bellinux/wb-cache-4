25|$|The book {{emphasizes}} {{the thesis that}} the United States did not adequately educate themselves from prior events and in addition did not pay enough attention to the morals of the Vietnam War and the 1920 uprising {{by the people of}} Iraq against the United Kingdom forces. These events could have imparted valuable pointers to the Bush Administration such as the notion <b>that</b> <b>terrorism</b> tactics used by insurgency operations including guerrilla warfare were difficult to defeat effectively, {{even in the face of}} overwhelming U.S. military forces.|$|E

25|$|Rennie Van Zyl, {{the head}} South African investigator, {{examined}} three wristwatches from the baggage {{recovered from the}} surface; two of the watches were still running according to Taiwan time. Van Zyl deduced the approximate time of impact from the stopped watch. The aircraft crashed at 00:07:00, around three minutes after the last communication with air traffic control. Immediately after the crash, the press and public opinion suspected <b>that</b> <b>terrorism</b> brought down the Helderberg. Experts searched for indicators of an explosion on the initial pieces of wreckage discovered, such as surface pitting, impact cavities and spatter cavities caused by white hot fragments from explosive devices that strike and melt metal alloys found in aircraft structures. Experts found none of this evidence. The investigators drew blood samples from bodies {{and found that the}} bodies had soot in their tracheae.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, {{on the morning of}} March 10, 1989, Rogers' wife Sharon escaped uninjured when a pipe bomb {{exploded}} and set fire to her minivan as she sat stopped at a red light {{across the street from the}} University Towne Center shopping mall in San Diego. The van was registered in the name of Will Rogers III, and many people at the time of the bombing suspected <b>that</b> <b>terrorism</b> was involved. Five months later, the Associated Press reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had shifted focus away from terrorism towards the possibility of someone with a personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers. As of 2003, the bombing of Rogers' van remains an unsolved case, despite a major investigation involving at some time up to 300 police and FBI agents. On February 17, 1993, the case was featured on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries, but no additional information was uncovered.|$|E

500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 <b>that</b> <b>terrorism</b> suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E
