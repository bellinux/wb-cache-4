But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing <b>this</b> <b>sentence</b> and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

He came on to a chorus of boos from the Arsenal supporters. Shortly into this return match, Barton was involved in an incident with Samir Nasri, putting in a strong tackle, for which the referee did not give a foul. The tackle, though hard, was legal. Minutes later, Nasri deliberately clipped Barton while tracking back, {{for which he was}} booked. At the end of the match, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan was involved in an altercation with Nasri and Arsenal captain William Gallas, in regards to the incident.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, {{the judge}} sentenced Cisneros and Garza {{to life in}} prison after the jury decided that neither of them posed a threat to society, and thus did not deserve the death penalty. <b>This</b> <b>sentence</b> {{included}} the possibility for parole after they complete 35 mandatory years behind bars. The head juror said the tapes were the strongest evidence against them, along with Martínez' testimony. Fischer's parents said they were pleased with the decision, and that justice was finally served, but said their son's absence would leave a void {{for the rest of their}} lives. The prosecution intended to have Cisneros sentenced to death arguing that her actions were premeditated. Garza's closing words centered around him being told by Martínez that Cisneros wanted Fischer hurt, and that he would not have knowingly participated in a murder. Both defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. Cisneros's attorney in particular said the judge's denial of a separate trial for his client was the reason for his early appeal. The defense said that trials where two defendants implicate each other are often severed, The judge refused to sever them because Cisneros's statement did not mention Garza. The defense also said they would appeal the verdict because they believed that the voice recordings were tampered with and unauthenticated. A judge formalized the jury's decision and sentenced Cisneros and Garza {{to life in prison}} on April 18.|$|E

50|$|Dutch {{word order}} is underlyingly SOV (subject-object-verb).
