40|$|<b>Transfer</b> of {{learning}} occurs when learning in one context enhances (positive <b>transfer)</b> or undermines (negative <b>transfer)</b> a related performance in another context. <b>Transfer</b> includes near <b>transfer</b> (to closely related contexts and performances) and far <b>transfer</b> (to rather different contexts and performances). <b>Transfer</b> {{is crucial to}} education, which generally aspires to impact on contexts {{quite different from the}} context {{of learning}}. Research on <b>transfer</b> argues that very often <b>transfer</b> does not occur, especially far" <b>transfer.</b> However, sometimes far <b>transfer</b> does occur. Findings from various sources suggest that <b>transfer</b> happens by way of two rather different mechanisms. Reflexive or low road <b>transfer</b> involves the triggering of well-practiced routines by stimulus conditions similar to those in the learning context. Mindful or high road <b>transfer</b> involves deliberate effortful abstraction and a search for connections. Conventional educational practices often fail to establish the conditions either for reflexive or mindful <b>transfer.</b> However, education can be designed to honor these conditions and achieve <b>transfer...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite large {{organizational}} investments of {{time and}} money into employee training newly acquired knowledge and skills are not being <b>transferred</b> back to the job. Three propositions suggested by current studies were examined: (a) a positive <b>transfer</b> climate will enhance <b>transfer</b> of training, (b) supervisor support is a key factor in <b>transfer</b> climate, and (c) <b>transfer</b> maintenance strategies implemented at the workplace will improve the <b>transfer</b> climate and subsequently the <b>transfer</b> of training. ^ State employees (n = 33), who cared for mentally retarded clients, attended a 3 -hour training session in ethical decision-making. Supervisors (n = 6) also received 1 -hour instruction in the implementation of <b>transfer</b> maintenance strategies. The intervention, support given to supervisors to implement their <b>transfer</b> maintenance strategies, was carried out for 4 months. Dependent variables were: <b>transfer</b> climate, maintenance of learning, and <b>transfer</b> of training. Using the Learning <b>Transfer</b> Questionnaire, General <b>Transfer</b> Climate was measured immediately following training and Specific <b>Transfer</b> Climate surrounding the decision-making training was measured 4 months after training. Maintenance of learning scores were calculated by comparing Case Analysis Written Test (CAWT) administered immediately after training and 4 months later. <b>Transfer</b> of training was measured using Levels-of-Use (LoU) interview tool 4 months after training. ^ ANOVAs were used {{to determine the extent to}} which maintenance of learning and <b>transfer</b> climate differed between the intervention and non-intervention group. The extent to which <b>transfer</b> of training differed between intervention and non-intervention groups was determined via a Chi-square calculation. A Pearson correlation was performed to determine the relationships between <b>transfer</b> of training and <b>transfer</b> climate factors. ^ Results showed that maintenance of learning and <b>transfer</b> climate were not significantly different between groups. Motivation to <b>transfer</b> and <b>transfer</b> design had medium effect size relationships with <b>transfer.</b> The intervention group had significantly higher LoU than the non-intervention group. The intervention consisted primarily of guided practice, with inconsistent or nonexistent implementation of <b>transfer</b> maintenance strategies by supervisors.
