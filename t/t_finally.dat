The effect of usual additives on Decomposition Temperature (Td) of the ABFA and their interactions were examined. It was observed that the addition of kickers (thermal stabilizers) to the ABFA will result in a lower Td. Moreover, it was noticed that kickers based on lead metals showed the most activating effect on the Td. However, PVC resin showed an inhibiting action on the <b>Td.</b> <b>Finally,</b> when both kickers and PVC resin were employed together, the former exhibited a predominant action at low heating rate, while the later showed a predominant action at high heating rate.
