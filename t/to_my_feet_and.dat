2500|$|The School Badge {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time on the cover of the June Magazine in 1902, and was designed by architect, Robin Dods. The central figure represents Wisdom, standing upon or emerging from, the open book, representing Knowledge. In her hand is a lamp, representing Truth. The school motto Honour before Honours can be found at the base of the badge. [...] The illustration is also a clear reference to the famous verse from Psalm 119:105 [...] "Your word is a lamp <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> a light to my path." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another Midrash {{taught that}} {{the words of the}} Torah give light to those who study them, but those who do not occupy {{themselves}} with the Torah stumble. The Midrash compared this to those who stand in the dark; as soon as they start walking, they stumble, fall, and knock their face on the ground – all because they have no lamp in their hand. It is the same with those who have no Torah; they strike against sin, stumble, and die. The Midrash further taught that those who study the Torah give forth light wherever they may be. Quoting [...] "Your word is a lamp <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> a light to my path," [...] and [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord," [...] the Midrash taught that God offers people to let God's lamp (the Torah) be in their hand and their lamp (their souls) be in God's hand. The lamp of God is the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light." [...] The commandment is [...] "a lamp" [...] because those who perform a commandment kindle a light before God and revive their souls, as [...] says, [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord." ...|$|E
60|$|I leapt at the word--literally leapt <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> {{stared at}} him with blazing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, for thy Guido is one heady, strong, [...] Dangerous to disquiet; let him bide! [...] He {{needs some}} bone to mumble, help amuse [...] The {{darkness}} of his den with; so, the fawn [...] Which limps up bleeding <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> lies, [...] --Come to me, daughter,--thus I throw him back!" ...|$|R
60|$|I strove <b>to</b> move <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> could not. It was true, {{the bone}} was broken above the knee.|$|R
6000|$|I got <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> briskly, <b>and</b> he made {{way for me}} to go out. As I {{passed through}} the lobby I heard Mr. Burns' voice saying: ...|$|R
60|$|I rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> {{taking down}} my hat {{commenced}} to brush it. Mabane {{looked up from}} his work.|$|E
60|$|I STARTED <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Miserrimus Dexter. I {{was too much}} {{agitated}} {{to be able to}} speak to him.|$|E
60|$|I shrank back, {{and came}} slowly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>And</b> then Gervasio spoke, {{and his voice}} boomed and thundered with righteous indignation.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} very heroic {{situation}} for us. My poor friend rose with a crimson face. I sprang <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> also <b>and</b> bowed with such dignity as I could muster.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{turned to}} meet the renewed attack of the savage foe. One lion fell in his tracks, another {{stumbled}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> very <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> then I leaped within and slammed the portal to.|$|R
60|$|Then I gave up all hope. There {{was no time}} <b>to</b> gain <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> escape; indeed I did {{not wish}} to do so, who felt that there are some {{failures}} which can only be absolved by death. I just knelt there, waiting for the end.|$|R
60|$|I rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> took up my hat. Again {{she whispered}} in his ear, {{and this time}} he seemed to assent.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} {{understand}} the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning, struggled <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and,</b> standing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I had {{somewhat}} recovered, and I was not slow {{to obey the}} command. I arose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> took my place beside my newly-arrived friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look in the basket," [...] I said, rising <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> She looked, <b>and</b> gave {{a little}} scream--of delight, I was pleased to note.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked it}} up," [...] I gurgled feebly, as I got on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> again, <b>and</b> it is a solemn {{fact that my}} mind was so {{disturbed}} {{that at the moment}} I could remember nothing else about the ring except that I had picked it up in Leo's cave.|$|R
6000|$|Darius had {{his head}} out of the {{companion-way}} before it was possible for me <b>to</b> get on <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> I heard a strange voice cry sharply: ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{my heart}} swelled till I {{thought it would}} burst with rage. Then of a sudden, a certain spirit entered into me and I rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> said, ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had risen}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> was {{standing}} with {{the handle of the}} door in my hand. Mr. Stanley took the hint, yet I fancied that he departed unwillingly.|$|E
60|$|I leaped <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> seized her hands. For {{a second}} {{she looked at}} me, startled. Then she tore them away and ran behind the dipping chair in the corner.|$|E
60|$|The {{hotel was}} not far away, {{and in a few}} minutes my wife {{returned}} with a fishing-pole. She stood on tiptoe, and reached it high in air; but all she could do was <b>to</b> strike <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> legs with it. My most frantic exertions did not enable me <b>to</b> get <b>my</b> hands low enough to touch it.|$|R
6000|$|Which done, {{he dragged}} him <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> [...] <b>And</b> said [...] "Here die, but end thy breath [...] In full confession, lest thou fleet [...] From <b>my</b> first, <b>to</b> God's second death! [...] 100 [...] Say, hast thou lied?" [...] And, [...] "I have lied [...] To God and her," [...] he said, and died.|$|R
500|$|The new couple {{lived in}} Godwick Manor, their peace {{disturbed}} in 1776 when Wenman's health began to fail. He finally died on 10 April after [...] "a constipation which medicine could not remove", leaving Coke {{in charge of}} a 30,000 acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled all over me from <b>my</b> head <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> I came forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|R
6000|$|... "At this I sprang <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> I am sure my {{eyes and}} cheeks were blazing. 'Do you mean,' I cried, 'that you would make him a better wife than I do?' ...|$|E
60|$|Isobel's {{speech was}} never ended. Mabane and Arthur stood {{within a few}} feet of us, the former grave, the latter white and angry. I rose slowly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> held out my hand to Allan.|$|E
60|$|So enthralled was I by the {{spectacle}} that I quite forgot myself, {{and the better}} to view him, the great lion, I had risen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> stood, not fifty paces from him, in full view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought the}} same thing myself {{when we were talking}} about it yesterday," [...] Bertie said. [...] "Of course I did not say anything, but I am sure Dias is right. I found it very hard work <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> <b>footing,</b> <b>and</b> I really don't believe that I could have done it if I had been dressed as a woman. And Dias can carry you like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode {{in sight}} of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot! I {{expected}} no peace--no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment {{of what it would}} be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> proposed <b>to</b> bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> {{specialist}} <b>and</b> {{he looked over}} the CT Scan,”she wrote. “It looks as though it's just the one bone in <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> The cuneiform2 <b>and</b> 3 bone. I also told him my two smaller toes were hurting pretty badso he x-rayed them again and sure enough they were both broken. Not that it makes much of a difference. They were aligned just fine so he didn't'have to reset anything. It will still take 4-6 weeks." ...|$|R
60|$|Dazed though I was, I {{stumbled}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> staggered back to Woola's assistance, to {{find his}} savage antagonist circling ten feet above the ground, beating madly at the clinging calot with all six powerful legs.|$|E
60|$|All at {{once the}} bedroom door opened softly, and Helene was {{standing}} there, looking at me. At first I saw her dimly, as in a vision, then clearly. I leaped <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> went and stood beside her.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone I sprang <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> passing out of the pantry, made my way after them to the deck. None of the men saw me, and I lost no time in going forward.|$|E
60|$|We crossed it in safety. On {{the other}} side {{extended}} a long flat of upheaved crusts of salt and mud, full of holes and pitfalls, an exceedingly toilsome and painful place to travel, and for all we could tell, dangerous too. I had all I could do <b>to</b> watch <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> find surfaces <b>to</b> hold <b>my</b> steps. Eventually we crossed this broken field, reaching {{the edge of the}} gravel slope, where we were very glad indeed to rest.|$|R
5000|$|Japan's {{censorship}} laws {{prevent the}} display of the sexual organs, allowing Kobayashi to maintain her insistence on performing only simulated sex on camera throughout her AV career. Kobayashi considered her AV performances to be another form of acting {{and came up with}} various techniques for appearing to have actual sex. For example, she says, [...] "I used to get the directors <b>to</b> tickle <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> then tried not to laugh so it looked as though I was climaxing." ...|$|R
60|$|I was too dazed {{to realise}} very clearly what {{happened}} after that. Dompierre, I know, kicked {{open the door of}} the house, and the crowd rushed in, in his wake. I managed <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> work <b>my</b> way gradually out of the crowd. I must have gone on mechanically, almost unconsciously, for the next thing that I remember with any distinctness was that I found myself once more speeding down the Rue Blanche, with all the yelling and shouting some little way behind me.|$|R
