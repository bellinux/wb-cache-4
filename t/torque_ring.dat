40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} improvement of denim fabric appearance by reducing the residual torque of weft yarns. In this paper, 100 % cotton low torque yarns of linear density 84 tex and 58 tex with different twist levels were produced by a new method of producing low torque yarns on a modified ring spinning machine. The results from the experiments show that the low torque yarns possess lower yarn snarling turns. Based on the mechanism analysis of 'small snake' pattern, the low <b>torque</b> <b>ring</b> yarns were applied to the denim fabric to improve fabric smoothness appearance. The experimental study demonstrates that the 'small snake' pattern of the denim fabrics has been greatly decreased by using the low residual <b>torque</b> <b>ring</b> yarns as weft yarns. Objective measurements of the low stress mechanical and surface properties of denim fabrics using low torque and conventional yarns were conducted. The {{results show that the}} denim fabric using the low <b>torque</b> <b>ring</b> yarns as weft yarns presents a smoother and more even surface. Moreover, a multiple comparisons LSD test of fabric properties indicates that there is no significant difference on tensile strength and tearing strength between fabric samples using the low <b>torque</b> <b>ring</b> yarns and conventional ring yarns with normal twist level as weft yarns, respectively. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that the 'small snake' pattern of the fabric decreased with the reduction of weft yarn snarling. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Abridged) The {{following}} {{describes a}} model of a broad planetary ring whose sharp edge is confined by a satellite's m^th Lindblad resonance (LR). This model uses a streamline formalism to calculate the ring's internal forces, namely, ring gravity, pressure, viscosity, as well as a hypothetical drag force. The model calculates the streamlines' forced orbit elements and surface density throughout the perturbed ring. The model is then applied to the outer edge of Saturn's B ring, which is maintained by an m= 2 inner LR with the satellite Mimas. Ring models are used to illustrate how a ring's perturbed state depends on the ring's physical properties: surface density, viscosity, dispersion velocity, and the hypothetical drag force. A comparison of models to the observed outer B ring suggests that the ring's surface density there is between 10 and 280 gm/cm^ 2. The ring's edge also indicates where the viscous torque counterbalances the perturbing satellite's gravitational <b>torque</b> on the <b>ring.</b> But an examination of seemingly conventional viscous B ring models shows that they all fail to balance these <b>torques</b> at the <b>ring's</b> edge. This is due ring self-gravity and the fact that a viscous ring tends to be nearly peri-aligned with the satellite, which reduces the satellite's <b>torque</b> on the <b>ring</b> and makes the ring's edge more difficult to maintain. Nonetheless, the following shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B ring, but only in an extreme case where the ratio of the ring's bulk/shear viscosities satisfy ~ 10 ^ 4. However, if the dissipation of the ring's forced motions is instead dominated by a weak drag force, then the satellite can exert a much stronger torque that can counterbalance the <b>ring's</b> viscous <b>torque.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal on April 3, 200...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comparative}} study on the structural characteristics of three-dimensional fiber configurations in low <b>torque</b> and <b>ring</b> spun yarns. Three-dimensional configurations of tracer fibers in {{the two types of}} yarns were measured by a continuous measurement system. Critical parameters were obtained, including the occurrence frequencies of unique features, the radial position, fiber spatial orientation angle, migration frequency, and amplitude. Results reveal that nearly half of the fiber specimens in low torque yarns followed a deformed non-concentric conical helix of which the size of helical loops varies significantly and the axis of the helix does not coincide with the yarn axis. Local reversion phenomena appear on many fiber segments. In addition, most fibers in low torque yarns are located close to the yarn center, and alter their radial position in a yarn with larger amplitude. Those features offer an explanation for the excellent physical properties of low torque yarns, that is, low twist, high strength, and low residual torque. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
30|$|The {{magnetic}} torque sensor has many advantages, such as durability, wide application, high reliability, and good prospects for development. It is widely concerned by researchers. ShaoPeng studied a <b>ring</b> <b>torque</b> sensor [7] {{based on the}} counter magnetostriction effect of amorphous alloy. It used the method of sticking the ribbon of the amorphous alloy. However, it was large, not easy to install, and not easy to monitor the torque in real time. Meng et al. studied a non-contact torque sensor [8] based on the change of magnetic induction, which was not suitable for dynamic measurement of torque because it needed manually adjusting two digital potentiometers. Muro et al. studied a <b>ring</b> <b>torque</b> sensor [9] based on the measurement of magnetic field by the Hall detection circuit, and magnetostrictive effect whose measuring range was small. Jiles studied the theory of magnetomechanical effects [10] and it provided a theoretical basis for the {{magnetic torque}} sensor. Sablik et al. studied the magnetostriction when the magnetic shaft suffered a tensile or compressive stress and applied a magnetic field. The stress and magnetic field were coaxial [11]. The torque sensor proposed in this paper uses the non-contact signal extraction circuit to detect the deflection angle of magnetization vector and explores {{the relationship between the}} deflection angle and the torque; instead of using the wireless communication equipment, the non-contact torque measurement is realized directly.|$|R

A shepherd satellite lacking damping mechanisms will force oscillations in {{the motion of}} a ring particle that are symmetrical {{with respect to the}} encounter geometry. If such damping mechanisms as density wave propagation or a dissipative medium are present, a lag in particle response provides the asymmetry that exerts a net <b>torque</b> on the <b>rings.</b> While the <b>torque</b> on a given particle depends on the degree of damping, that dependence disappears when the torque is averaged over a range of orbits spanning resonances if the degree of damping is within a certain range.

This method appears to analyze the physical nature of shepherding in sparse particle disks. Thus, it may be very useful in calculating the <b>torque</b> on Neptune's <b>rings</b> and on protoplanets in the solar nebula.

We tested the apparatus for hippocampal EEG recordings in adult C 57 black mice. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were induced using extended hippocampal kindling (≥ 95 daily stimulation). Control animals underwent similar hippocampal electrode implantations but no stimulations were given. Combined EEG and webcam monitoring were performed for 24 h daily for 5 – 9 consecutive days. During the monitoring periods, the animals moved and accessed water and food freely and showed no apparent restriction in ambient cage activities. Ictal-like hippocampal EEG discharges and concurrent convulsive behaviors that are characteristics of spontaneous recurrent seizures were reliably recorded in a majority of the monitoring experiments in extendedly kindled but not in control animals. However, 1 – 2 rotary wires were disconnected from the implanted headset in some animals after continuous recordings for ≥ 5 days.

Kurgan 2 contained two graves – one dated {{to the first}} centuries AD, {{the other to the}} Middle Ages, when the North Black Sea steppes were inhabited by the nomadic Polovеts tribes. This article discusses grave 2. The burial was made in a chamber {{in the form of a}} niche. Robbers destroyed one of the grave’s walls but the burial remained undisturbed. The buried woman of 35 - 40 years old was laying extended on back, head to west. Decayed wood from the funerary stretchers preserved under the skeleton. The rich grave goods included a bronze cauldron, an iron knife, two silver <b>torques,</b> hair <b>rings,</b> and a mirror. Fragments of the wooden frame, felt, textile, and gilded silver foil from a headdress preserved in area of the woman’s chest. The kurgan was encircled by a ditch; its northern part had two ledged niches made in the outer wall. Animal bones and ceramic shards with remains of the funerary feast were unearthed on the ditch bottom. The ditch was thoroughly made and has unique construction features. Judging by its lower layers, the dug-out soil was stacked not only on the kurgan’s surface but also round the ditch’s outer perimeter. The ditch remained opened for a long time and was gradually filled with flooded soil. Grave goods are typical for the Cuman graves of the 12 th - early 13 th centuries. The assemblage suggests a high social status of the buried woman. It is possible that for some time the area surrounded by the ditch was used as a sanctuary; afterwards the burial of a noble woman was performed, the kurgan was covered with a layer of soil. ...|$|R
40|$|Saturn's {{rings are}} rock-poor, {{containing}} 90 %- 95 % ice by mass. As a group, Saturn's moons interior {{to and including}} Tethys are also about 90 % ice. Tethys itself contains 40 % rock. Here we simulate {{the evolution of a}} massive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring material spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring with an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the Roche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites, including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation factor for Saturn of $Q~ 10 ^ 4 $. We find that <b>ring</b> <b>torques</b> and capture of moons into mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends outward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $ 10 ^ 9 $ years, even with relatively slow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis distribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary impactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive a mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and Rhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content. This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of rock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more rock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the current inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors stochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring.

The relative dynamic torque on the paddle {{was measured in}} millivolts {{as a function of}} granulating fluid added and time. The data generated from a formulation containing lactose, corn starch and povidone were reproducibile. The maximum relative standard deviation was less than two percent at any time point on the torque curve. Formulations containing lactose, dicalcium phosphate and mannitol matrices (with four different drugs) showed five distinct phases in the torque profile. Phases I, II, and III of the wet granulation process were studied for formulations containing five drugs (phenylpropanolamine, theophylline, hydrochlorothiazide, phenytoin and acetaminophen). Granule properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, particle size measurement and determination of bulk physical properties, including flow rate as well as compressibility. A computer-interfaced instrumented tablet press was used to generate compression profiles from which the compressibility of the granules was assessed. The instrumented tablet press data substantiated a simple theory for the relationship between granulation properties and ease of compaction. ^ The data suggest optimum flowable and compressible granulations can be obtained only from phase III of the process irrespective of the drug, drug concentration and matrix. The disintegration and hardness for some formulations (theophylline, phenylpropanolamine and hydrochlorothiazide) were sensitive to variations in the wet granulation process. However, dissolution and friability for these formulations were relatively insensitive to changes in the processing variables. ^ A (3 x 2 x 3) factorial experimental design was used to investigate the effect of binder, binder level and granulating fluid on the wet granulation process. It was found that all these factors exerted statistically significant effects on granulations flow rate, tablet ejection force, hardness, disintegration and dissolution at fifteen and thirty minutes. A second factorial experimental design (4 x 5 x 3) was used {{for the study of the}} effect of disintegrant, disintegrant concentration and percent intragranular disintegrant on the dissolution rate of tablets made by wet granulation process. The data indicate that these factors exerted statistically significant effects on disintegration and dissolution at fifteen and thirty minutes. This instrumentation can be used to determine the optimum amount of granulation fluid necessary for the wet granulation process. In addition, it can be a valuable tool for validation of the wet granulation process. ...|$|R
