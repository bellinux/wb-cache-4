50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marbles</b> are {{currently}} held {{in the collection of}} the British Museum. After gaining its independence from the Ottoman Empire, Greece began major projects for the restoration of the country's monuments, and has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's actions to remove <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> from <b>the</b> Acropolis and the Parthenon, which is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments, disputes the subsequent purchase of <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> by <b>the</b> British Government and urges the return of <b>the</b> <b>marbles</b> to Greece. <b>The</b> dispute is ongoing and in 2014 UNESCO agreed to mediate between Greece and the United Kingdom in resolving the dispute of <b>the</b> Elgin <b>Marbles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Either side of <b>the</b> <b>Marble</b> Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} {{a collection of}} early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>Marble</b> Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above <b>the</b> <b>Marble</b> Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
5|$|She {{was then}} buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Her {{skeleton}} was identified during renovations {{of the chapel}} in 1876, in the reign of Queen Victoria, and Anne's resting place is now marked in <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> floor.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun {{sanctuary}} {{was damaged}} by an earthquake {{in the fourth}} century BC, which demolished <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed {{at the base of the}} podium.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marbles</b> covered <b>the</b> song, {{their version}} being {{released}} in August 1969 as their third {{single in the}} United States where it reached #128. It was only their single that charted in the Billboard Hot 100. <b>The</b> <b>Marbles</b> covered <b>the</b> song in August that year, it was also released as a single in Germany and France. <b>The</b> <b>Marbles</b> had recently worked with the Gibb brothers between 1968 and 1969, but the brothers were not involved on <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> version. <b>The</b> arrangement was by Jimmy Horowitz. Its flipside was [...] "Little Boy" [...] was also written by the Gibb brothers.|$|R
5000|$|King wrote a 2006 book {{entitled}} <b>The</b> Elgin <b>Marbles</b> defending <b>the</b> British retention of <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> against Greek claims that {{they belong to}} Greece and should be moved to Athens.

5|$|Although <b>The</b> <b>Marble</b> Index {{was largely}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it has {{achieved}} acclaim from music critics over time. Nico's unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, they served as a musical and visual prototype for the 1980s post-punk movement's gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974)—which are now considered parts of a trilogy.|$|E

He prefers <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (widely {{believed to be the}} statue that is now in the Vatican) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E

50|$|After gaining its {{independence}} from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, Greece {{began a series of}} projects to restore its monuments. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's removal of <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> from <b>the</b> Acropolis and the Parthenon,, which is {{regarded as one of the}} world's greatest cultural monuments.

5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
5|$|On the house's {{east side}} are three rooms, whose {{original}} presence {{is open to}} debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch {{was used as the}} Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is a {{protected}} {{area in the}} northern Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The 4,554-acre (1,843ha) park, including <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> cave, is 20 miles (32km) east of Cave Junction, on Oregon Route 46. The protected area, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), is in southwestern Josephine County, near the Oregon–California border.|$|E

5|$|The Emirates Stadium pays {{tribute to}} Arsenal's former home, Highbury. The club's offices are officially called Highbury House, located {{north-east}} of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of Herbert Chapman that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of Claude Ferrier (architect of Highbury's East stand), Denis Hill-Wood (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsène Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in {{the entrance of the}} Diamond Club. Additionally, the two bridges over the railway line to the east of the stadium, connecting the stadium to Drayton Park, are called the Clock End and North Bank bridges, after the stands at Highbury; the clock that gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica of the clock. The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located {{to the north of the}} stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> statues that were once held in <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> halls of Highbury.|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{decorating the}} open arcade {{known as the}} Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who {{imported}} works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} was originally inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects {{a mixture of}} contemporary traditions {{at the time of}} its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a Bengali style, and a baldachin from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.|$|E

50|$|Greece {{is seeking}} {{repatriation}} of <b>the</b> Elgin <b>Marbles</b> from <b>the</b> British Museum, {{taken from the}} Parthenon by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. Since 1816, the British Museum has held <b>the</b> Parthenon <b>Marbles</b> ("In Britain, <b>the</b> acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting", text from <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> article), and, despite the tortuous and ill explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display <b>the</b> <b>marbles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The two artists, therefore, {{a decade}} after their mutual debut, now {{returned}} {{to compete for the}} most prestigious commission in Brescia of the moment. Tamagnino's qualification, almost unique, was to have performed much of the decoration on <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> facade of the Certosa of Pavia, while Gasparo Cairano leveraged a spectacular leap of artistic quality, which had already produced the first Caesars at the public Palazzo.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E

50|$|In <b>the</b> game, <b>marbles</b> {{roll down}} a twisted path {{toward the goal}} and the player must stop them by {{launching}} new <b>marbles</b> into <b>the</b> oncoming ones. The DS touchscreen is used to 'flick' <b>the</b> <b>marbles</b> from their launch point to their destination with <b>the</b> stylus. <b>The</b> <b>marbles</b> disappear if player matches three or more <b>marbles</b> of <b>the</b> same type; <b>marbles</b> of <b>the</b> same color are magnetically attracted to each other over any length of wide open space, and allowing for chains of disappearances to occur.|$|R
25|$|Both MORI {{poll results}} have been characterised by proponents of the return of <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> to Greece as {{representing}} a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping <b>the</b> <b>Marbles</b> at <b>the</b> British Museum.|$|R
