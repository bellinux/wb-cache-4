5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

5|$|The tiny sac fungus Phyllachora banksiae {{subspecies}} westraliensis {{has been}} described from the leaves of B.speciosa, its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1–3mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25–0.75 by 0.25–1mm appear in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Great Red <b>Spot</b> varies {{greatly in}} hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{occasionally}} [...] "disappears", becoming evident only through <b>the</b> Red <b>Spot</b> Hollow, which is its {{niche in the}} South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Interestingly, its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> tends to be dark, {{and when it is}} dark, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> is usually light. These periods when <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> was darkest in the periods 1961–1966, 1968–1975, 1989–1990, and 1992–1993.|$|R

5|$|The {{recorded}} {{series of}} two-dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding {{to a different}} crystal orientation, is converted into a three-dimensional model of the electron density; the conversion uses the mathematical technique of Fourier transforms, which is explained below. Each spot corresponds to {{a different type of}} variation in the electron density; the crystallographer must determine which variation corresponds to which spot (indexing), the relative strengths of <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> in different images (merging and scaling) and how the variations should be combined to yield the total electron density (phasing).|$|E
5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the Great Red Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the Great Red Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E
5|$|Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced {{necks and}} round ears. Of the living, non-hybrid felids, the lion {{is second only}} to the tiger in length and weight. Its skull is very {{similar to that of the}} tiger, {{although}} the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with dark spots on their body. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.|$|E
50|$|The roll yield is {{the yield}} that a futures {{investor}} captures as their long {{position in a}} futures contract converges to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price; in a backwardated futures market the price rolls up to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price, so <b>the</b> roll yield is positive, whereas when the market is in contango the price rolls down to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price, so <b>the</b> roll yield is negative. <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> price can stay constant, but the investor will still earn returns from buying discounted futures contracts, which continuously roll up to <b>the</b> constant <b>spot</b> price.|$|R
50|$|Other {{settlement}} dates are also possible. Standard {{settlement dates}} are calculated from <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date. For example, a one-month foreign exchange forward settles {{one month after}} <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date. I.e., if today is 1 February, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date is 3 February and the one-month date is 3 March (assuming these dates are all business days). For a trade with two dates, such as a foreign exchange swap, the first date is usually taken as <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date.|$|R

5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that ale, in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the ale. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> on the Moon were seen as scars from the ale’s bites. While ale devoured the Sun or the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if ale succeeded in devouring the Moon, the Sun would die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E

5|$|No South Sudanese athletes met the Olympic {{qualifying}} standards, but {{the nation}} was allotted three universality places to compete {{in track and field}} events. The South Sudan Athletics Federation nominated Marial, Santino Kenyi, and Mangar Makur Chuot to fill these spots. Eight days {{prior to the start of}} the Games, however, the South Sudan National Olympic Committee informed Chuot, who had already been accredited, by email that he had been removed from the team. Chuot was a refugee who had fled the Second Sudanese Civil War after the death of his father and been resettled in Australia in 2008. In 2014 he became the Australian 200 metre champion, but elected to compete for South Sudan rather than Australia at the Games. After his selection for the South Sudanese delegation was confirmed in December 2015, he returned to the country of his birth and became the 2016 South Sudanese 100 and 200 m champion, setting a national record in the latter discipline. The NOC chose Margret Hassan, a competitor in the 200 m event, to take his spot, despite another athlete, national record holder Viola Lado, having posted a better time in the lead up to the Olympics. When the Athletics Federation protested, the NOC claimed that Samsung, who had featured Hassan in one of their advertisements, had pressured the organization to give her one of <b>the</b> <b>spots,</b> an accusation that Samsung denied. When his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected, Chuot proclaimed his decision to leave the sport.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E

40|$|We model {{strategic}} {{behavior of}} {{two types of}} suppliers in B 2 B spot markets: a supplier that has forwardcontracts and uses <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market only for inventory liquidation, and a supplier that uses <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market as its sole selling channel. We find that when <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market demand is small, the supplier that has forward contracts has a higher incentive to invest in expanding <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market. When <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market more prevalent. We show that a supplier with forward contracts benefits from the existence of <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand. We find that suppliers producing only for <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market gain from working in industries where contracted demand and spot market demand are positively correlated, whereas suppliers that have forward contracts benefit from working in industries with a negative correlation between demands, since {{it allows them to}} better manage risk. In addition, both total industry supply and spot market supply are higher in industries where demands are negatively correlated...|$|R
