5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin took <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Postumia {{and swept}} through Venetia, taking in rapid {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E

5|$|Where {{he did not}} {{overwrite}} Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the Circus Maximus was redeveloped so {{that its}} total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Appia. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones of the Imperial Horse Guard were ground up and put to use in a basilica on <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{years of}} Absolute Dynamic Topography from {{satellite}} altimetry data {{are used to}} study the seasonal variability of the circulation in the Sulu Sea (SS) through Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. It is revealed that first seasonal EOF mode shows a basin-scale anticyclonic/cyclonic circulation in summer/winter and second seasonal EOF mode shows a weak basin-scale anticyclonic/cyclonic meander flow from the Mindoro Strait to the Sibutu Passage, and the typical surface circulation structure in the SS is shown as a basin-scale anticyclonic/cyclonic circulation (or meander) centered at about 120. 8 degrees E, 8. 6 degrees N in August and December. According to the numerical experiments by a connected single-layer and two-layer model, it is shown that the upper circulation in the SS {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> outflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Sibutu Passage and seasonal local wind stress. Either an outflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Sibutu Passage or the summer monsoon may cause an anticyclonic circulation in the SS, while the winter monsoon may cause a cyclonic circulation. Either an outflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Sibutu Passage or the winter monsoon would push the water out of <b>the</b> SS <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Balabac Strait but bring the water into <b>the</b> SS <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro Strait, while the summer monsoon would bring the water into <b>the</b> SS <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Balabac Strait but push the water out of <b>the</b> SS <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro Strait. Thus, in summer, the induced anticyclonic circulation with the negative relative vorticity is stronger in the SS but <b>the</b> water transports <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro and the Balabac straits are less, while in winter, the induced cyclonic circulation with the mainly positive relative vorticity is weaker but <b>the</b> water transports <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro and the Balabac straits are larger. <b>The</b> inflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro Strait is also significant since <b>the</b> outflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Sibutu Passage is mainly compensated by <b>the</b> inflow <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro Strait. The western strengthening near the Palawan Island and the asymmetry of the circulation in the SS is caused by the beta effect. <b>The</b> transport <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Mindoro Strait is generally much larger than that <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Balabac Strait. An inflow into <b>the</b> SS <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Dipolog Strait contributes little to the circulation in the SS except for the current field near this strait. A stronger lower layer current than the upper layer one near the Mindoro Strait is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for a century and a half. The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Marianne {{moved in}} with Pontecorvo at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panthéon on 4 January 1938. Their son Gil was born on 30 July.

Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond.

5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of <b>the</b> <b>Via</b> Montenapoleone.|$|E
