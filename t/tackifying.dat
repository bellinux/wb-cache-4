40|$|ABSTRACT: Liquid {{composite}} molding processes {{use both}} simple and complex sets of preforms to produce high-performance composite parts. To produce these parts, binder materials known as tackifiers {{are used to}} shape the fabrics into complicated preforms prior to the resin injection. Tackifier materials enhance the formability and handling operations of dry reinforcements, and {{become an integral part}} of the composite laminate. A commercial tackifier was employed to form fiberglass preforms. Various preforms were prepared with different concentrations of the tackifier, and the effect on the permeability was studied. A permeability work-cell was used to continuously measure the permeability of the <b>tackified</b> preform for different fiber volume fractions. An analytical model based on a unit cell definition in combination with microscopic images was used to predict the permeability of <b>tackified</b> preforms. A comparison between the experimental measurement and the predicted results show the deficiencies in the unit cell approach to model permeability of preforms containing low concentrations of tackifiers...|$|R

40|$|Mulching after {{wildfires}} is {{a common}} treatment designed to protect bare ground from raindrop impact and reduce subsequent erosion. We tested the effectiveness of three mulching methods on the Indian Fire near Prescott, Arizona, USA. The first method felled all fire-killed trees, chipped the logs and limbs, and spread the chips across the hillslope with a mobile selffeeding chipper. The second treatment spread compressed, <b>tackified</b> straw pellets that expand when wetted and release a soil flocculant. The third treatment was rice straw applied at 4. 5 Mg ha- 1 (2 tons ac- 1). Each treatment was applied to a small catchment with a silt fence sediment trap at the mouth. Sediment yield from an untreated (control) catchment was also measured. The treatments were tested by three erosion-causing summer rain events. The chipping treatment and the pellets reduced sediment yield by 80 to 100 percent compared to the control {{in the first two}} storms. In the third event, a multi-day storm followed by an intense thunderstorm, the pellets and straw reduced sediment yield 42 and 81 percent, respectively. The effectiveness of the chip treatment could not be completely assessed because of partial failure of the sediment fence. Vegetation cover was low on all sites; ground cover from pellets decreased more than did straw or chips by mid-October, probably accounting for the lower effectiveness in reducing erosion compared to straw...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tackifying</b> resins (TRs) {{are often}} added to {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive films {{to increase their}} peel strength and adhesion energy. In waterborne adhesives, the TR is dispersed in water using surfactants and then blended with colloidal polymers in water (i. e., latex). In such waterborne systems, {{there are problems with}} the colloidal stability and difficulty in applying coatings of the particle blends; the films are often hydrophilic and subject to water uptake. Here, an alternative method of making waterborne, tackified adhesives is demonstrated. The TR is incorporated within the core of colloidal polymer particles via miniemulsion polymerization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with force spectroscopy analysis reveals there is heterogeneity in the distribution of the TR in films made from particle blends and also in films made from miniemulsion polymers. Two populations, corresponding to TR-rich and acrylic-rich components, were identified through analysis of the AFM force-displacement curves. The nanoscale maximum adhesion force and adhesion energy were found to be higher in a miniemulsion film containing 12 wt % <b>tackifying</b> resin in comparison to an equivalent blended film. The macroscale tack and viscoelasticity are interpreted by consideration of the nanoscale structure and properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrocolloid wound {{dressings}} {{have been}} in use for nearly two decades, and have rarely caused allergic contact dermatitis. DuoDERM E (DuoDERM CGF) is a newer version of DuoDERM (ConvaTec Ltd, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ) that contains a sensitizing derivative of colophony. OBJECTIVE: We describe three patients who developed eczematous lesions under this type of wound covering. METHODS: The patients were patch tested to the European standard series, to a glues and adhesives series, and to pieces of various adhesive dressings. RESULTS: The patients displayed positive patch tests to colophony and to DuoDERM E or DuoDERM CGF hydrocolloid dressings. CONCLUSION: These dressings contain the pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin as a <b>tackifying</b> agent, and this substance retains the sensitizing potential of colophony. The addition of this compound is an important change that may negatively alter the good safety record of ConvaTec dressings...|$|E

40|$|In the roofing industry, {{modified}} bitumen membranes {{are generally}} applied by torching {{with an open}} flame or mopping with hot bitumen or asphalt and cold adhesive.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{hydrocolloid}} dressings {{have been introduced}} routinely {{in the treatment of}} various types of wounds. They provide a moist environment promoting autolytic debridement, and stimulate angiogenesis. However, long-term application often leads to inflammation of the skin in the immediate area of the ulcer, causing irritant dermatitis in many cases, but sometimes also leads to contact sensitization. A 32 year-old woman burnt herself by an iron, and presented to our clinic and was treated with Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ. Nine days later, she again presented with an erythematous oozing patch with edema, and allergic contact dermatitis was suspected. A patch test (TRUE test) was performed and a positive reaction to colophonium was obtained. Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ contains hydrogenated rosin (colophonium) as the <b>tackifying</b> agent, so we could diagnose this case as allergic contact dermatitis due to the hydrogenated rosin in Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Tackifying</b> resins (TR) {{are often}} used to improve the {{adhesive}} properties of waterborne pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) derived from latex dispersions. There is a large gap {{in the understanding of}} how, and to what extent, the film formation mechanism of PSAs is altered by the addition of TR. Herein, magnetic resonance profiling experiments show that the addition of TR to an acrylic latex creates a coalesced surface layer or “skin ” that traps water beneath it. Atomic force microscopy of the PSA surfaces supports this conclusion. In the absence of the TR, particles at the surface do not coalesce but are separated by a second phase composed of surfactant and other species with low molecular weight. The function of the TR is complex [...] According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the TR increases the glass transition temperature of the polymer and decreases its molecular mobility at high frequencies. On the other hand, the TR increases the molecular mobility at lower frequencies and thereby promotes the interdiffusion of latex particles to create a skin layer. In turn, the skin layer is a barrier that prevents the exudation of surfactant to the surface. The TR probably enhances the coalescence of the latex particles b...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} a 69 -year-old female {{patient with a}} longstanding history of venous ulcerations on both lower legs and multiple sensitivities, who developed eczematous lesions with the hydrocolloid dressing Combiderm (Convatec Ltd., a Bristol-Myers Squibb division, Ickenham, Middlesex, UK). Epicutaneous tests were positive to this dressing and to a modified colophonium derivative, i. e. glyceryl rosinate, however not to the unmodified colophonium from the standard series. A {{review of the literature}} showed several case reports about sensitization to similar hydrocolloids being distributed under various brand names in different countries and which contain the pentaerythritol ester of the hydrogenated rosin as the <b>tackifying</b> agent. Some of the patients described did, while others did not, react to colophonium but only to a modified derivative. In our patient, the reaction to glyceryl rosinate most probably represent cross-sensitivity with the modified colophonium derivative used in Combiderm, the presence (but not the exact nature) of which was showed by the company. In patients where allergic contact dermatitis from hydrocolloid dressings is strongly suspected and colophonium tests negatively, patch testing to modified colophonium derivatives should therefore be performed. As the complete composition of wound dressings is most often unknown, we urgently advocate legal requirements for labelling of those and in fact all medically used devices...|$|E

Three different resin loadings, i. e. 40, 80 and 120 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) were used in the adhesive formulation. The viscosity of adhesive was determined by a HAAKE Rotary Viscometer whereas loop tack and peel strength of paper/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film were measured using a Lloyd Adhesion Tester operating at 30 cm/min. Results indicate that the viscosity of adhesive decreases with increasing % SBR whereas loop tack passes through a maximum value at 20 % SBR for all resin loadings.

40|$|Abstract. The {{tennis ball}} {{adhesive}} formula is optimized {{by studying the}} impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent {{on the performance of}} NR-based tennis ball adhesive. The optimizing formula of rubber is: NR 100, Carbon Black N 220 30, ZnO 8. 3, Stearic Acid 2. 2, Phenolic <b>Tackifying</b> Resin 3, Sulfur 3, Accelerator D 0. 5. The adhesive made through such optimizing formula shows good performance and the finished tennis ball has excellent adhesion and air tightness, satisfying the design requirements. Intorduction The excellent elasticity of tennis ball is provided by the internal air inflation. Therefore, air retaining of tennis ball is an important influencing factor of its performance, which is not only related with the air tightness of tennis ball bladder, but also closely related with the adhesion of tennis ball. The vulcanization of tennis ball is very unique. Firstly, it vulcanizes the rubber into two hemispheres and puts in inflating agent. Then, these two hemispheres will be bonded together for secondary vulcanization. This indicates that the bonding of tennis ball is the bonding between vulcanized rubbers, which is more difficult than that between unvulcanized rubbers. Therefore, firm adhesion requires experiment on the adhesive formula in order to gain qualified tennis ball adhesive. This paper optimized the tennis ball adhesive formula by studying the impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent on the performance of NR-based tennis ball adhesive...|$|E
