25|$|During the Manhattan Project {{to develop}} the nuclear bomb in the early 1940s the {{chemical}} toxicity of uranium was an issue. It was found that uranium oxides stick very well to cotton cloth, and did not wash out with soap or laundry detergent. However, the uranium would wash out with a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. Clothing can become contaminated with <b>toxic</b> <b>dust</b> of depleted uranium (DU), which is very dense, and hence used for counterweights in a civilian context, and in armour-piercing projectiles. DU is not removed by normal laundering; washing with about 6 ounces (170 g) of baking soda in 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water will help to wash it out.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecosystems}} of the Aral Sea and {{the river}} deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne <b>toxic</b> <b>dust</b> that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and {{the people living in}} the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the <b>toxic</b> <b>dust</b> storms. All of this has resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. The dust storms also contribute to water shortages through salt deposition, which has accelerated glacial melting to as much as 12 times the normal rate. The overuse of pesticides on crops to preserve yields has made this worse, with pesticide use far beyond health limits. Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land, and fields are being flushed with water at least four times per day to try to remove the salinity from the soils. The dust storms make regional winters colder, and summers hotter.|$|E

40|$|Asbestosis and slllcosis are chronic, fibrosing lung {{diseases}} due to prolonged Inhalation {{of asbestos}} fibers or silica particles. However, {{little is known}} about the implication of these <b>toxic</b> <b>dusts</b> on cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Among the first types of cells that are in contact with the dusts are the alveolar macrophages (AM). We studied the effect of different concentrations of UICC chrysotile asbestos and silica on 18 -h cytotoxlclty of AM against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -resistant P 8 i 5 target cells or TNF-sensltlve L 929 target cells. Rat AM, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, were incubated for 2 h with 20, 50, or 100 Lg/ml chrysotile or silica before the addition of target cells. AM cytotoxiclty was significantly Inhibited at> 20. tg/ml of chrysotile. In contrast, silica did not Inhibit AM-mediated cytotoxlcity at any concentration used. Asbestos, but not silica, caused significant production of PGE 2 by macrophages and target cells. Addition of the cycle-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to our system abolished all inhibitIon by asbestos. These results suggest that the inhibition of AM-mediated cytotoxicity by chrysotlle was caused by prostaglandins, and that fibrogenic particles differ in their capacity to modu-late AM function.

25|$|When {{they were}} finally {{allowed to return}} to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted. Upon {{residents}}' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December, 2001. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread <b>toxic</b> <b>dust,</b> debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.|$|E

2500|$|On September 11, 2001 ("9/11"), the United States {{was struck}} by a {{terrorist}} attack when 19 al-Qaeda hijackers commandeered four airliners to be used in suicide attacks and intentionally crashed two into both twin towers of the World Trade Center and the third into the Pentagon, killing 2,937 victims—206 aboard the three airliners, 2,606 who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground, and 125 who were in the Pentagon. The fourth plane was re-taken by the passengers and crew of the aircraft. While they were not able to land the plane safely, they were able to re-take control of the aircraft and crash it into an empty field in Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people including the four terrorists on board, thereby saving whatever target the terrorists were aiming for. Within two hours, both Twin Towers of the World Trade Center completely collapsed causing massive damage to the surrounding area and blanketing Lower Manhattan in <b>toxic</b> <b>dust</b> clouds. All in all, a total of 2,977 victims perished in the attacks. In response, President George W. Bush on September 20 announced a [...] "War on Terror". On October 7, 2001, the United States and NATO then invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden.|$|E

40|$|An acute febrile illness {{associated}} with unloading silos occurs {{more frequently than}} any other farm associated respiratory illness in mid state New York. This report describes 29 cases of organic <b>dust</b> <b>toxic</b> syndrome (also known as pulmonary mycotoxicosis) occurring in 24 men and one woman {{with a mean age}} of 29 years. In 16 instances more than one worker was exposed to the dust, and in 12 of these shared exposures more than one worker became ill. Patients presented 5. 3 (SD 3. 3) hours after inhalation of organic dust and mould with fever (79 %), myalgia (76 %), chest tightness (72 %), cough (66 %), and headache (59 %). The mean temperature was 38. 7 degrees C and the mean white blood cell count 13. 2 X 10 (9) /l. In contrast to patients with allergic alveolitis, nearly all these patients had normal breath sounds, chest radiographs, and arterial oxygen saturation.

40|$|Airborne dust, {{suspended}} {{inside a}} space vehicle or in future celestial habitats, can present {{a serious threat}} to crew health if it is not controlled. During the Apollo missions to the moon, lunar dust brought inside the capsule caused eye irritation and breathing difficulty to the crew when they launched from the moon and re-acquired "microgravity. " During Shuttle flights reactive and <b>toxic</b> <b>dusts</b> such as lithium hydroxide have created a risk to crew health, and fine particles from combustion events can be especially worrisome. Under nominal spaceflight conditions, airborne dusts and particles tend to be larger than on earth because of the absence of gravity settling. Aboard the ISS, dusts are effectively managed by HEPA filters, although floating dust in newly-arrived modules can be a nuisance. Future missions to the moon and to Mars will present additional challenges because of the possibility that external dust will enter the breathing atmosphere of the habitat and reach the crew's respiratory system. Testing with simulated lunar and Martian dust has shown that these materials are toxic when placed into the lungs of test animals. Defining and evaluating the physical and chemical properties of Martian dusts through robotic missions will challenge our ability to prepare better dust simulants and to determine the risk to crew health from exposure to such dusts...|$|R

40|$|Five coal-containing dusts from {{materials}} of the Ruhr coal mining area {{were applied to}} female Wistar rats by intratracheal instillation of a suspension of 6 mg dust 10 or 20 times weekly. The content of SiO 2 in two dusts from milled coal (lean coal and lower rich coal) was not detectable (means < 0. 1 %) and ash content was low (5 and 6 %). The other coal-containing dusts (fine fractions of dusts collected from the air in mines) contained more SiO 2 (1. 3 %, 9 %, 16. 7 %) and more ash (~ 40 %, ~ 60 %, 86 %). The median metric diameters were between 1. 8 and 4. 0 nm and the density between 1. 4 (milled coal) and 2. 4 g/mL (stone dust). The tumor response was dose-dependent. After treatment with the lower dose, malignant and/or benign lung tumors were found in 57 - 72 % {{with the exception of}} 34 % of the stone dust with 86 % ash and 16. 7 % quartz. The results show that relatively coarse coal dusts with a lung burden of about 40 mg induced unexpectedly high lung tumor rates wiht the sensitive intratracheal model.

40|$|The outpost {{position}} of the olfactory bulb (OB) between the direct inputs from sensory neurons of the nasal epithelium {{and other parts of}} the brain suggests its highest vulnerability among all brain structures to penetration of exogenous agents. A number of neurotropic viruses have been found to invade the brain through the OB. There is growing evidence that microscopic particles of <b>toxic</b> <b>dusts</b> can propagate from the nasal epithelium to the OB and further into the brain. These harmful agents impair cellular elements of the brain. Apparently, cells in the OB are the most affected, as they are the first to encounter viral infections and toxic particles. It is well known that neuronal and glial progenitors are continuously generated from neuronal stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain and then migrate predominantly into the OB. Therefore, it is feasible to suggest that substitution of injured or dead cells in the OB by new-born neurons, differentiating from progenitors, plays a role in protecting the OB neuronal microcircuits from destruction. Furthermore, some cytokines and chemokines released in response to infection and/or intoxication can modulate different stages of neurogenesis (proliferation, migration, and differentiation). We hypothesize that continuous neurogenesis in the olfactory system throughout adulthood evolved as a protective mechanism to prevent impairment of the most ancient but vitally important sensory system. In addition, differentiation of a substantial portion of progenitors to glial cells, including macrophages and microglia, may create an additional barrier to exogenous agents on their way deep to the brain. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|R
