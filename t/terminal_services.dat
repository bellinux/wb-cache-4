25|$|Terminal servers {{have also}} been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a {{terminal}} connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with thin clients, which use up to 1/8 {{the amount of energy}} of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption. There has been an increase in using <b>terminal</b> <b>services</b> with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include <b>Terminal</b> <b>Services</b> for Windows and the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) for the Linux operating system.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista onwards, <b>Terminal</b> <b>Services</b> also {{includes}} a multi-party desktop sharing capability known as Windows Desktop Sharing.

Windows Desktop Sharing can be used to share the entire desktop, a specific region, or a particular application. Windows Desktop Sharing can also be used to share multi-monitor desktops. When sharing applications individually (rather than the entire desktop), the windows are managed (whether they are minimized or maximized) independently at the server and the client side.|$|E
