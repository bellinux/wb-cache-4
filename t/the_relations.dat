5|$|At its height, Nagar {{encompassed}} most of {{the southwestern}} half of the Khabur Basin, and was a diplomatic and political equal of the Eblaite and Mariote states. The kingdom included at least 17 subordinate cities, such as Hazna, and most importantly Nabada, which was a city-state annexed by Nagar, {{and served as a}} provincial capital. Nagar was involved in the wide diplomatic network of Ebla, and <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> between the two kingdoms involved both confrontations and alliances. A text from Ebla mention a victory of Ebla's king (perhaps Irkab-Damu) over Nagar. However, a few years later, a treaty was concluded, and <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> progressed toward a dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu of Ebla, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the Finns sought new political partners.

As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E
