5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{returns to}} Erinsborough and sets {{fire to the}} Lassiter's complex. He also kills Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), when Gus catches him. Paul helps rebuild the complex and reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. Paul strikes a deal with Affirmacon to build on Ramsay Street and he gets his protégé Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> the local wetlands. When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken to the bush and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22. Paul begins a relationship with Izzy and his estranged daughter Elle moves in. To celebrate the Lassiter's Hotel 20th anniversary, Paul and several of his neighbours go on a joy flight to Tasmania. During the flight, a bomb explodes causing the plane to crash into the sea. Paul, Izzy and Elle survive.|$|E

25|$|Costs of {{emptying}} {{septic tanks}}. The cost of emptying septic tanks can be significant. Some people avoid using their septic tanks, {{because if they}} do the tank fills up more quickly and they must pay to empty it more often.

25|$|The second way is for humans, individually, <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> less. That {{requires}} {{social and}} political will, together with a shift in awareness so more people respect the environment and are less disposed to abuse it. At an operational level, regulations, and international government participation is needed. It is often very difficult to regulate marine pollution because pollution spreads over international barriers, thus making regulations hard to create as well as enforce.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} there is an {{association}} between fetal and/or placental weight and exposure to ambient levels of air pollution in mice. Design: Chronic experiments on mice that were exposed <b>to</b> <b>polluted</b> vs. clean air. Setting: Environmental exposure to atmospheric pollution. Animal(S) : Female Swiss mice (n = 70) were maintained at different stages of gestation in an exposure chamber located at an intersection with heavy traffic in a major city in Brazil. Control mice were maintained in a similar chamber, located adjacent to the exposure chamber but equipped with filters for particles and reactive gases. Intervention(s) : Animals were divided into six groups as follows: no exposure, exposure <b>to</b> a <b>polluted</b> chamber throughout gestation, exposure <b>to</b> a <b>polluted</b> chamber during the 1 st week of pregnancy, exposure <b>to</b> a <b>polluted</b> chamber during the 2 nd and 3 rd weeks, exposure <b>to</b> a <b>polluted</b> chamber during the 1 st and 2 nd week, and exposure <b>to</b> a <b>polluted</b> chamber during the 3 rd week. Main Outcome Measure(S) : At the end of the gestational period, the determination of fetal and placental weight was performed after cesarean section. Result(s) : Exposure to air pollution during the 1 st week of pregnancy promoted a significant reduction in fetal weight. Mice exposed <b>to</b> <b>polluted</b> air, in any phase of gestation, presented with lower placental weight in comparison to mice maintained in clean chambers. Conclusion(s) : Exposure to ambient levels of traffic pollution at early phases of gestation is a determinant for decreased final fetal weight. Placental weight is reduced with exposure to air pollution at any phase of gestation. (Fertil Steril (R) 2008; 90 : 1921 - 4. (C) 2008 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{wastewater}} {{exiting the}} anaerobic digestion facility will typically have {{elevated levels of}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability <b>to</b> <b>pollute.</b> Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively affect them by causing eutrophication. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through {{the water in a}} sequencing batch reactors or reverse osmosis unit.|$|E
25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E

2500|$|Drawing on {{concepts}} of institutional variance and path dependence, varieties of capitalism theorists (such as Peter Hall and David Soskice) identify two dominant modes of economic ordering {{in the developed}} capitalist countries, [...] "coordinated market economies" [...] such as Germany and Japan, and an Anglo-American [...] "liberal market economies". However, such approaches imply that the Anglo-American liberal market economies, in fact, operate in a matter close to the abstract notion of [...] "the market". While Anglo-American countries have seen increasing introduction of neo-liberal forms of economic ordering, this has not led to simple convergence, but rather a variety of hybrid institutional orderings. Rather, {{a variety of new}} markets have emerged, such as for carbon trading or rights <b>to</b> <b>pollute.</b> In some cases, such as emerging markets for water, different forms of privatization of different aspects of previously state run infrastructure have created hybrid private-public formations and graded degrees of commodification, commercialization, and privatization.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{examples}} of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, {{for its own}} sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the common law, the primary protection was found in the law of nuisance, but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from pig sties, strict liability against dumping rubbish, or damage from exploding dams. Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the [...] "Great Stink" [...] of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the River Thames began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848 had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close cesspits around the city in an attempt to [...] "clean up" [...] but this simply led people <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> the river.

London also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the [...] "Great Smog" [...] of 1952, which in turn triggered its own legislative response: the Clean Air Act 1956. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning coal) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{installed}} Chatrapati Pratapsinh Bhonsle, {{a descendant}} of Shivaji, who noted in his diary in the 1820s–1830s that the Gaekwads (another powerful Maratha dynasty) had Kunbi origins. He notes further [...] "These days, when the Kunbis and others grow wealthy, they try <b>to</b> <b>pollute</b> our caste. If this goes on, dharma itself will not remain. Each man should stick to his own caste, {{but in spite of}} this these men are trying to spread money around in our caste. But make no mistake, all Kshatriyas will look to protect their caste in this matter." [...] Later, in September 1965, the Marathi Dnyan Prasarak newspaper published a piece which addressed the changing meaning of the term Maratha, the social mobility of the day, the origins of the Maratha-Kunbi castes, the eating habits and the living conditions of the people of Maharashtra. The author of the piece claims that only a very small circle of families, like those of Shivaji Bhonsale, can claim the Kshatriya status. He also states that these Kshatriya families {{have not been able to}} stop the inroads made by the wealthy and powerful Kunbis, who had bought their way into Kshatriya status through wealth and inter-marriages. Of the most powerful Maratha dynasties, the Shindes (later anglicised to Scindia) were of Kunbi origin. A [...] "Marathaisation" [...] of the Kunbis was seen between the censuses of 1901 and 1931, which shows a gradually declining number of Kunbis resulting from more of them identifying themselves as Marathas. Lele notes in 1990 that a subset of the Maratha-Kunbi group of castes became the political elite in the state of Maharashtra in the 1960s and 1970s and have remained so to the present day. The elite Maratha-Kunbis have institutionalised their ideology of agrarian development through their control of the Congress party. The state Government of Maharashtra does not recognise a group called Maratha-Kunbi.|$|E
