5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>spoke</b> for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} over the change of the seat of the German {{government}} from Bonn to Berlin, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>spoke</b> out in favor of Berlin. In a memorandum released in February 1991, he declared that he would not act as a mere [...] "decoration of a so-called capital", urging the diet to move more constitutional organs to Berlin. To compensate for a delay in the transfer to Berlin of the government and the federal parliament, Weizsäcker declared in April 1993 that he would be performing an increased share of his duties in Berlin. He decided not to wait for the renovation and conversion as the presidential seat of the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince's Palace) at Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard, and to use instead his existing official residence in West Berlin, the Bellevue Palace beyond Tiergarten park.|$|E

2500|$|When Israel {{refused to}} {{withdraw}} its {{troops from the}} Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh, Eisenhower declared, [...] "We must not allow Europe to go flat on its back for the want of oil." [...] He sought UN-backed efforts to impose economic sanctions on Israel until it fully withdrew from Egyptian territory. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson and minority leader William Knowland objected to American pressure on Israel. Johnson told the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that he wanted him to oppose [...] "with all its skill" [...] any attempt to apply sanctions on Israel. Dulles rebuffed Johnson's request, and informed Eisenhower of the objections made by the Senate. Eisenhower was [...] "insistent on applying economic sanctions" [...] {{to the extent of}} cutting off private American assistance to Israel which was estimated to be over $100million a year. Ultimately, the Democratic Party-controlled Senate would not cooperate with Eisenhower's position on Israel. Eisenhower finally told Congress he would take the issue to the American people, saying, [...] "America has either one voice or none, and that voice is the voice of the President – whether everybody agrees with him or not." [...] <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>spoke</b> to the nation by radio and television where he outlined Israel's refusal to withdraw, explaining his belief that the UN had [...] "no choice but to exert pressure upon Israel".|$|E

50|$|Purchasing {{power was}} a matter of great concern to the UAW's mostly working-class membership, who used the {{opportunity}} in the UAW to protest against price increases in the face of static wages. One of their first actions was a city rally, organised in 1950 in conjunction with the Trades Union Defence Committee. The Korean War saw the price of living in Australia rise by 21% in 1951, which spurred the UAW to heat up their campaign for an affordable decent standard of living. They would conduct surveys and draw up petitions on the cost of living, which would then be passed on to unions as evidence in wage cases. The UAW argued their own cases as well—for example, in a 1953 inquiry on milk prices in Sydney, where <b>the</b> UAW <b>president</b> <b>spoke</b> from <b>the</b> viewpoint of a mother responsible for her children's nutrition.|$|R
