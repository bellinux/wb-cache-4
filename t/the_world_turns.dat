5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> but was recommended {{for a role}} on The Young and the Restless instead. The role was to be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E

She began acting as an extra in the daytime drama television series Guiding Light. From 2000 to 2001, she portrayed the recurring character Lucy Montgomery on the CBS soap opera As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns.</b> She played Joni Stafford on the ABC soap All My Children from 2002 to 2003.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} {{as a player}} in 1994, Simms first joined ESPN {{then went on to}} join NBC's lead broadcast crew, teaming with Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire on that network's coverage of Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XXXII. Simms also announced Weightlifting at the 1996 Summer Olympics and served as a sideline reporter on the NBA on NBC for NBC Sports. In 1998, he moved to CBS with the AFC package, teaming first with Greg Gumbel (through the end of the 2003 season) and later with Jim Nantz on the CBS's lead broadcast team. He also worked with Armen Keteyian, Bonnie Bernstein and Lesley Visser. He hosts Inside the NFL on Showtime (another CBS holding) with James Brown and Cris Collinsworth. He has appeared on CBS Daytime since joining CBS, with a 2007 appearance as himself on the CBS soap opera As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns,</b> and in February 2010 an appearance on The Price Is Right (with Nantz) to present a Super Bowl XLIV showcase.

5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Brian Bloom was {{the first}} winner of this award for his {{portrayal}} of Dusty Donovan on As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns.</b> The awards ceremony had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award category was originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile Male in a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this category was introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show {{during a time of}} voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.|$|E

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> (often {{referred}} to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010. Irna Phillips created As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> as a sister show to her other soap opera Guiding Light. Running for 54 years, As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> holds the second-longest continuous run of any daytime network soap opera on American television, surpassed only by Guiding Light. As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> was produced for the first 43 years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from 2000 until 2010.|$|E
25|$|And so it {{was with}} As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns,</b> with its slow-moving {{psychological}} character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> throughout its run, and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often focused on one central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips' Road of Life), the expanded 30-minute format of As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga.|$|E
25|$|Serials have {{included}} Goede tijden, slechte tijden (1990–present), Onderweg naar Morgen (1994–2010) and Goudkust (1996–2001). In 2016 Goede tijden, slechte tijden spin-off Nieuwe Tijden started airing. U.S. daytime serials As <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> and The Bold and the Beautiful have aired in the Netherlands; As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> began airing {{in the country}} in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.|$|E

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> {{remained}} at 1:30/12:30 pm until March 20, 1987, when CBS cancelled the five-year-old Capitol {{in favor of}} The Bold and the Beautiful. CBS scheduled it at 1:30/12:30 pm, and finally settled As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> at 2:00/1:00 pm, where it remained until its final network episode in September 2010. Although facing {{the full length of}} Another World and One Life to Live once again, the Douglas Marland era of 1985 to 1993 had a resurgence in ratings, and by 1991, it was back in its once habitual top-four placing. As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> survived NBC's cancellation of its sister Another World in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E
25|$|On December 8, 2009, CBS {{announced}} that it was canceling As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> due to low ratings. The show taped its final Procter and Gamble scenes for CBS on June 23, 2010, and with a dramatic storyline finale, its final episode on the network aired on September 17, 2010. On October 18, 2010, CBS replaced As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> with a newly debuted talk show The Talk.|$|E

25|$|The first hour-long {{episode of}} As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> aired on December 1, 1975. The {{first half of}} the show {{continued}} to perform well against Let's Make a Deal on ABC, which the network moved to the noon timeslot within four weeks of the expansion. The second half put As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> in competition with ABC's most popular game show, The $10,000 Pyramid, which had done well against Guiding Light since the network moved it to 2:00 pm at the end of 1974 and kept doing so against As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns.</b> Although the expansion was not a complete success, {{at the end of the}} season, the serial was again at the top of the daytime Nielsens despite a 1.4-point drop from the year before.|$|E
25|$|The {{irony in}} his {{appearance}} in the above-mentioned episodes, is that 20 years before, LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl, the youngest son of Lisa's fifth husband, Whit McColl (played by Wagon Train star Robert Horton, who was killed off shortly before Fulton's return to the show). So, to many long-time fans of both As <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> and The Young and the Restless, seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show was weird. History was also made during LeBlanc's appearance on As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns,</b> since both shows are made by different production companies (Bell Dramatic Serial Company for The Young and the Restless; Procter and Gamble for As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns),</b> although {{they are on the}} same network.|$|E

25|$|By summer 1975, CBS began {{considering}} expansions {{of two of}} the Procter & Gamble-owned {{soap operas}} Search for Tomorrow and As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns)</b> to forty-five minutes daily, in response to NBC's expansion of full-hour expansions of Another World and Days of Our Lives some months earlier. The network changed its mind, however, when it realized that to do so would force them to take the thirty minute station break slot at 1:00 p.m. Eastern that affiliates used to air other programming. CBS then decided to simply expand As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns,</b> which was still the top rated soap opera on television, to sixty minutes. Since CBS decided against taking the 1:00 p.m. slot from the affiliates, and the network did not intend to move As <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Turns</b> from its 1:30 p.m. slot, this made the low-rated Edge of Night expendable and CBS told Procter & Gamble it would not be renewing the series.|$|E
