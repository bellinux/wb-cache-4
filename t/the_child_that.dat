Although Sharon claimed to have miscarried <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> had brought about their marriage, she soon became pregnant again. In the fall of 1957, she gave birth to a girl they named Danna.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 World Series {{was also}} known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> he would {{hit a home run}} on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly {{inflated}} it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so.|$|E

This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community.

25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs {{to be taken care of}} by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Master, it is {{revealed}} {{that while the}} Seventh Doctor is Time's Champion, the Master is Death's. This {{is a result of}} an incident in their youth, where the Doctor killed a school bully who was trying to drown the Master; unable to cope with his guilt and grief, the child who would become the Doctor accepted a deal with Death (personified as a woman) to take away his pain, unaware that this would result in her erasing his memory of committing the crime and transferring it to the Master. Temporarily restored to the person he would have been if Death had not marked him, the Master forgives the Doctor for this, understanding that the adult cannot be blamed for the actions of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> did not foresee the consequences of his actions, but {{the end of the play}} implies that the Master will once again become Death's servant.|$|E

500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests. [...] A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor.

[...] When explaining a probable reason why the girl had remained unidentified, Walsh stated that [...] "people do not want to talk to cops," [...] possibly due to the fear of authorities investigating their own lives. For instance, the family of Anjelica Castillo, who were undocumented immigrants and never reported the victim missing due to fear of deportation. Walsh encouraged viewers to contact him instead, giving the number for the show he hosts, The Hunt With John Walsh and the URL for his profile on the CNN website. He confirmed that those submitting tips could remain anonymous.|$|E
500|$|After her divorce, Victoria went to {{live with}} her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera. She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth, who spent six months of each year with each parent. Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a {{difficult}} time reconnecting with her daughter. Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa, crying, before one visit to her mother. Ernst assured <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> her mother loved her too. Elisabeth responded, [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me." [...] Ernst remained silent and didn't correct the child's impression. Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge. The doctor advised the Tsar's family to notify the child's mother of her illness, but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram. Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the child's death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside. At Elisabeth's funeral, Victoria removed her Hessian Order, a medallion, and placed it on her daughter's coffin as a final gesture [...] "that she had made a final break with her old home." ...|$|E

500|$|There are {{two types}} of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the Road show. The LIVE! show is {{performed}} {{at the front of the}} stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] is sung to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> is celebrating the birthday ("I say Happy, you say Birthday..."). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members. The Road show is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants the kids to dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the kids that participated. Chuck E. comes out every hour on the half hour (12:30, 1:30, etc.).

500|$|Bell et al. {{rejected}} many accepted {{ideas about}} the development of homosexuality. They concluded that psychodynamic theories exaggerate the role of parents in the development of their sons' sexual orientation, and that the psychoanalytic model that attributed male homosexuality to dominant mothers and weak fathers is inadequate, there being barely any connection between boys' relationships with their mothers and the development of homosexuality. Bell et al. found the idea that [...] "cold, detached" [...] fathers and poor father-son relationships predispose boys toward homosexuality more plausible, but emphasized that these factors have only an indirect connection to sexual preference. Bell et al. suggested that relationships with parents might play a greater {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality, although they found having a cold or distant father less significant as a cause of female than of male homosexuality. They also rejected various sociological theories, such as the idea that homosexuality results from labeling by others. Overall, they concluded that sexual preference is likely to be already determined by the time boys and girls reach adolescence, and that there is a powerful link between gender nonconformity and the development of homosexuality in both sexes, but especially in men. Though stressing that their model [...] "applies only to extant theories and does not create new ones", Bell et al. wrote that they had identified [...] "a pattern of feelings and reactions within <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> cannot be traced back to a single social or psychological root".|$|E
