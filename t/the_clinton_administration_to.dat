25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E

The document contained a brief list of talking points that were designed to warn Sudan's top government officials about any involvement in alleged plots to kill U.S. diplomats working in Sudan. The alleged threats were based on evidence gathered by a foreign agent retained by the C.I.A., data which {{would be used to}} justify Petterson's reduction of American embassy personnel in Khartoum. The agent's information would later be found to have been fabricated, and would force the C.I.A. to redact or delete up to 100 reports on Sudan. Petterson would later state that he did not believe the intelligence findings warranted a draw down in embassy staff.|$|E

2500|$|Governments {{can choose}} to publish {{information}} in order to [...] "shame" [...] certain market participants into altering their behaviour. [...] The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging [...] "excessive" [...] prices {{in the eyes of}} the US government, was used by <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> curb increases in drug prices. [...] The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.|$|E

The inability or failure of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come {{down on the side of}} dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Fannie Mae {{came under}} {{pressure}} from <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. Additionally, Community Reinvestment Act regulators, {{under the direction of}} HUD secretary Andrew Cuomo, gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to [...] "credit-deprived" [...] areas. In essence, banks were rewarded for by-passing loan standards, and instead, approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to HUD {{focusing on the}} poor, Cisneros seized the goal of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> widen homeownership opportunities. [...] Under his command, HUD advanced {{a long way in}} expanding homeownership among the country's most under-represented groups — young adults, minorities and low- to moderate-income families. [...] When Cisneros arrived at HUD, the home ownership rate was 63.7 percent. When he left office in 1997 it had risen to 65.7 percent, its highest level since 1981. [...] Under policies set in place by Cisneros’ administration, at the end of Clinton's second term, homeownership continued its upward trend to 67.5 percent. [...] At the close of his term, Cisneros acknowledged that lower interest rates and a strong economy were primary factors for the increase. [...] However, the agency's ability to convince lenders, builders and real estate agents that there was money to be made in selling housing to low- and moderate-income individuals played a significant role, he said.|$|E
2500|$|Fox News, {{allegedly}} {{with the}} Administration's consent, identified and released a background briefing that Clarke gave in August 2002, at the Administration's request, {{to minimize the}} fallout from a Time magazine story about the President's failure to take certain actions before 9/11. In that briefing {{on behalf of the}} White House, Clarke stated [...] "there was no plan on Al-Qaeda that was passed from <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> the Bush administration," [...] and that after taking office President Bush decided to [...] "add to the existing Clinton strategy and to increase CIA resources, for example, for covert action, fivefold, to go after Al-Qaeda." [...] At the next day's hearing, 9/11 Commission member James Thompson challenged Clarke with the 2002 account, and Clarke explained: [...] "I was asked to make that case to the press. I was a special assistant to the President, and I made the case I was asked to make... I was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the Administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the Administration had done. And as a special assistant to the President, one is frequently asked to do that kind of thing. I've done it for several Presidents." ...|$|E
