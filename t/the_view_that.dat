5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility.

5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins.

5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{no amount}} of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence {{of one or more}} deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans.

5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E

5|$|Galactic habitable-zone {{theory has}} been criticized due to an {{inability}} to quantify accurately the factors making a region of a galaxy favorable {{for the emergence of}} life.

5|$|Hume criticised <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{we cannot}} speak about God, and {{proposed}} that {{this view is}} no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

These three views of financial sector deepening imply a different role for government.

5|$|Ignosticism is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> a {{coherent}} {{definition of a}} deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed.

5|$|Interactionist dualism, {{or simply}} interactionism, is the {{particular}} form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations.

5|$|Internal realism was <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent.
