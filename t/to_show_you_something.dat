The line-up eventually included Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomers Mike McCready (lead guitar) and Eddie Vedder (background vocals). McCready and Vedder were featured on the album due to their involvement with Ament and Gossard's next project, which became Pearl Jam. [...] The name Temple of the Dog is derived from the opening lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song [...] "Man of Golden Words", [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> like joy inside my heart, seems I been living in the temple of the dog".|$|E

The which, that I might do the more distinctly, I have handled particulars one by one, {{to the number of}} threescore and ten; namely, all that of them I could call to mind; because, as I believe, there was not one of them but had its signification, and so something profitable for us to know.|$|R

5000|$|For example, she narrated a {{story about}} eating a {{hamburger}} in a restaurant and feeling something hard in it. She spat it out and found it was white and looked like a toenail, and she said: [...] "I thought I was gonna die. I mean, what was a toenail doing in my hamburger?". Then {{she went to the}} restroom and, on the way, she saw Princess Lee Radziwill whom she described as the: [...] "classy lady that no one knows where she's the princess of." [...] However, what the Princess didn't know was that she had a tiny piece of toilet paper hanging off her shoe, and she was walking around and the toilet paper hadn't fallen off. [...] "I thought I was gonna be sick. So I said to her, 'Hey Princess Lee — what are ya tryin' to do, make me sick?'. Jane Curtin then asked her what this had to do with anything, and Roseannadanna replied: [...] "Well it just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you,</b> it's always <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> either got a toenail in your hamburger or toilet paper clinging to your shoe." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{remember}} {{the day when he}} declared, as Americans say, for Crest Hill.

60|$|But, my Lords, it is {{necessary}} that I should <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> more, because, prima fronte, this is some exculpation of Mr. Hastings: for, if he was only a partaker in a general misconduct, it was rather vitium loci et vitium temporis than vitium hominis. This might be said in his exculpation. But I am next <b>to</b> <b>show</b> your Lordships the means which the Company took for removing this grievance; and that Mr. Hastings's peculiar trust, the great specific ground of his appointment, was a confidence that he would eradicate this very evil, of which we are going to prove that he {{has been one of the}} principal promoters. I wish your Lordships to advert to one particular circumstance,--namely, that the two persons who were bidders at this time, and at this auction of government, for the favor and countenance of the Presidency at Calcutta, were Mahomed Reza Khân and Rajah Nundcomar. I wish your Lordships to recollect this by-and-by, when we shall bring before you the very same two persons, who, in the same sort of transaction, and in circumstances exactly similar, or very nearly so, were candidates for the favor of Mr. Hastings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank the}} gentleman," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crewe, [...] "and I propose to--(Handclapping and sachet.) I propose <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that <b>you</b> spend <b>something</b> like {{two hundred thousand}} dollars a year to elect legislators and send 'em to the capital, when the real government of your State is in a room in the Pelican Hotel known as the Railroad Room, and the real governor is a citizen of your town, the Honourable Hilary Vane, who sits there and acts for his master, Mr. Augustus P. Flint of New York. And I propose to prove to you that, before the Honourable Adam B. Hunt appeared as that which {{has come to be known}} as the 'regular' candidate, Mr. Flint sent for him to go to New York and exacted certain promises from him. Not that it was necessary, but the Northeastern Railroads never take any chances. (Laughter.) The Honourable Adam B. Hunt is what they call a 'safe' man, meaning by that a man who will do what Mr. Flint wants him to do. While I am not 'safe' because I have dared to defy them in your name, and will do what the people want me to do. (Clapping and cheers from a gentleman in the darkness, afterwards identified as Mr. Tooting.) Now, my friends, are you going to continue to allow a citizen of New York to nominate your governors, and do you intend, tamely, to give the Honourable Adam B. Hunt your votes?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The episodes {{received}} {{criticism for}} inaccuracy. Sue Jacob, {{a teacher at}} the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said EastEnders presented a [...] "poor picture of midwifery practice". During Janet's birth, Honey was refused an epidural while in pain, and later she was told that her baby had Down's syndrome alone, without her partner or family there to support her. Jacob commented, [...] "Women are vulnerable after giving birth and they need support systems in place ... The person caring for her is repeatedly referred to as a nurse in the episode but {{there is no way that}} a nurse would be in charge after birth. The midwife would also have been open and honest and said 'We need to get the baby checked out and we will get your partner' ... What the soaps do is set scenes which prompt people to talk about things which are affecting their lives. We are concerned people will wrongly think this Down’s syndrome story shows what really happens, and that if you have a problem there is no one there <b>to</b> support <b>you.</b> <b>Showing</b> <b>something</b> like this is not helpful." [...] Furthermore, Jacob noted that Honey was left alone for a long time to worry about the baby, which appeared rigid, and not floppy, as Down's syndrome babies do. In Jacob's opinion, a midwife would have been repeatedly in and out of the room to check on the mother. Additionally, one episode showed a health visitor reprimanding Honey for refusing Down's syndrome screening and Karen Reay, director of the Community Practitioners’ and Health Visitors’ Association called the episode [...] "insensitive and patronising". She added that the episode contained [...] "glaring anomalies", giving new mothers a [...] "fictitious and misleading" [...] view of health visitors, which could [...] "damage relationships with health professionals".|$|R

And now <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of the {{advantages}} that I also gained by this temptation; and first, By this I was made continually to possess in my soul a very wonderful sense both of the being and glory of God, and of his beloved Son; in the temptation 'that went' before, my soul was perplexed with 'unbelief, blasphemy, hardness of heart, questions about the being of God, Christ, {{the truth of the}} Word, and certainty of the world to come; I say, then I was greatly assaulted and tormented with' atheism; but now the case was otherwise, now was God and Christ continually before my face, though not in a way of comfort, but in a way of exceeding dread and terror. The glory of the holiness of God did at this time break me to pieces; and the bowels and compassion of Christ did break me as on the wheel;[54] for I could not consider him but as a lost and rejected Christ, the remembrance of which was as the continual breaking of my bones.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{introduced himself}} as a gentleman who was engaged to marry Mrs. Westerfield: he requested (not at all politely) to be permitted {{to look at the}} cipher. He was asked if he had brought a written order to that effect, signed by the lady herself. Mr. Bellbridge, resting his fists on the writing-table, answered that he had come to look at the cipher on his own sole responsibility, and that he insisted on seeing it immediately. [...] "Allow me <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else first," [...] was the reply he received to this assertion of his will and pleasure. [...] "Do you know a loaded pistol, sir, when you see it?" [...] The barrel of the pistol approached within three inches of the barman's big head as he leaned over the writing-table. For once in his life he was taken by surprise. It had never occurred to him that a professed interpreter of ciphers might sometimes be trusted with secrets which placed him in a position of danger, and might therefore have wisely taken measures to protect himself. No power of persuasion is comparable to the power possessed by a loaded pistol. James left the room; and expressed his sentiments in language which has not yet found its way into any English Dictionary.|$|E

6000|$|Go abroad {{among the}} barbarians of the earth, to China, for instance, and ask who is yonder thick-set, broad-chested man, with the hearty {{expression}} of face, and the splendid eastern uniform, {{and you will}} be told that he is Too Foo, the commander-in-chief of the Imperial forces in that department. If, still indulging curiosity, you go and introduce yourself to him, he will shake you heartily by the hand, and, in good English, tell you that his name is Walter Brown, and that he will be charmed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of Oriental life if you will do him the favour to take a slice of puppy dog in his pagoda after the review! If there is a chief of a hill tribe in Hindustan in want of a prime minister who will be able to carry him through a serious crisis, there is a Brown at hand, who speaks not only his own language, but all the dialects and languages of Hindustan, who is quite ready to assume office. It is the same at the diggings, whether of Australia, California, or Oregon; and we are persuaded that the man whose habitation is nearest to the pole at this moment, whether north or south, is a Brown, if he be not a Jones, Robinson, or Smith! ...|$|E

Rome will be poorly represented, but that may come the day after at Bath. And the next day too I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of our old River Severn.

There we shall have a whiff of America, our new find, from which the tobacco comes, and we shall be reminded of how we set sail thither--was it yesterday or the day before? You will understand at Bristol how it is that the energy has gone out of this dreaming land--to Africa and America and the whole wide world. It was the good men of Bristol, by the bye, with their trade from Africa to America, who gave you your colour problem. Bristol we may go through to-morrow and Gloucester, mother of I don't know how many American Gloucesters. Bath we'll get in somehow. And then as an Anglo-American showman I shall be tempted to run you northward a little way past Tewkesbury, just to go into a church here and there and show you monuments bearing little shields with the stars and stripes upon them, a few stars and a few stripes, the Washington family monuments." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{this then}} God plainly declareth, {{that he is}} {{resolved}} this way to rule, and that he pointeth at sin as his deadly foe: and if so, then, 'where sin aboundeth, grace must much more abound' (Rom 5:20).[5] For it is the wisdom and discretion of all that rule, to fortify themselves against them that rebel against them what they can. Wherefore he saith again, 'Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace' (Rom 6:14). Sin seeks for the dominion, and grace seeks for the dominion; but sin shall not rule, because it has no throne in the church among the godly. Grace is king. Grace has the throne, {{and the people of}} God are not under the dominion of sin, but of the grace of God, the which they are here implicitly bid to acknowledge, in that they are bid to come boldly to it for help: 'That we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help; to help in time of need.' For as from the hand and power of the king comes help and succour to the subject, when assaulted by an enemy; so from the throne of grace, or from grace as it reigns, comes the help and health of God's people. Hence it is said again, 'A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary' (Jer 17:12). Here then the saints take shelter from the roaring of the devil, from the raging of their lusts, and from the fury of the wicked. That also is a very notable place, 'He will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea' (Micah 7:19). He speaks here of God as solacing himself in mercy, and as delighting of himself in the salvation of his people, and that without comparison: 'Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy' (Micah 7:18). Thus is mercy and grace got into the throne, reigns, and will assuredly conquer all; yea, will conquer, and that with a shout. 'Mercy rejoiceth against judgment' (James 2:13). Yea, glorieth when it getteth the victory of sin, and subdueth the sinner unto God and to his own salvation, as is yet more fully showed in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15).
