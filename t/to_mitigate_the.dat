5|$|Water {{was taken}} at first {{from the town}} well {{opposite}} St Giles Church, but the excessive demand diminished the supply and spoiled its quality.

5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions.

5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, schools, businesses, and public transit were closed on Guam. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed approximately 15 representatives to the island <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> response time {{in the wake of}} the storm. Eight schools were opened as shelters, and more than 1,000 residents sought refuge during the height of the storm. Additional shelters were opened on the islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and nearly 200 people sought cover there. Airports and seaports between the three islands were shut down, causing flights to be canceled. Earlier in 2015, the Guam Weather Forecast Office created a Facebook page to help inform residents about typhoons; during Dolphin, the page received over 425,000views.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done.

Zoologists and botanists did what they could <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring.

The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811.
