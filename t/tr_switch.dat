50|$|In radar, a transmit/receive (<b>TR)</b> <b>switch</b> {{alternately}} {{connects the}} {{transmitter and receiver}} to a shared antenna. In the simplest arrangement, the switch consists of a gas-discharge tube across the input terminals of the receiver. When the transmitter is active, the resulting high voltage causes the tube to conduct, shorting together the receiver terminals to protect it, while its complementary, the anti-transmit/receive (ATR) switch, is a similar discharge tube which decouples the transmitter from the antenna while not operating, {{to prevent it from}} wasting received energy.|$|E
50|$|In radar, {{circulators}} {{are used}} {{as a type of}} duplexer, to route signals from the transmitter to the antenna and from the antenna to the receiver, without allowing signals to pass directly from transmitter to receiver. The alternative type of duplexer is a transmit-receive switch (<b>TR</b> <b>switch)</b> that alternates between connecting the antenna to the transmitter and to the receiver. The use of chirped pulses and a high dynamic range may lead to temporal overlap of the sent and received pulses, however, requiring a circulator for this function.|$|E

40|$|At {{the field}} {{strength}} of 9. 4 T, the highest field currently available for human MRI, the wavelength of the MR signals is significantly {{shorter than the}} size of the examined structures. Even more than at 7 T, constructive and destructive interferences cause strong inhomogeneities of the B 1 field produced by a volume coil, causing shading over large parts of the image. Specialized radio frequency hardware and B 1 management methods are required to obtain high-quality images that take full advantage of the high field strength. Here, the design and characteristics of a radio frequency front-end especially developed for proton imaging at 9. 4 T are presented. In addition to a 16 -channel transceiver array coil, capable of volume transmit mode and independent signal reception, it consists of custom built low noise preamplifiers and <b>TR</b> <b>switches.</b> Destructive interference patterns were eliminated, in virtually the entire brain, using a simple in situ radio frequency phase shimming technique. After mapping the Bmath image profile of each transmit channel, a numerical algorithm was used to calculate the appropriate transmit phase offsets needed to obtain a homogeneous excitation field over a user defined region. Between two and three phase settings are necessary to obtain homogeneous images over the entire brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{transceiver}} (<b>TR)</b> <b>switch</b> {{developed at}} NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory {{for use in}} their 50 kW peak power, 50 MHz transmitter is described.

The <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> is a conventional TR/ATR design with equivalent / 4 transmission line sections constructed of lumped constant coils and transmitting capacitors in ''Tee' sections.

40|$|Introduction: MRI is {{increasingly}} moving towards higher magnetic field {{because of the}} inherent high sensitivity and greater spectroscopic resolution. To realize these advantages, the front end, the RF coil and the receive chain, needs to be optimized. A Quadrature Microstrip Transmission Line (MTL) resonator was built and SNR is compared with a commercially available shielded linear birdcage coil. This work also includes development of a <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> module (consisting of T/R switch and preamplifier) and a Microstrip transmission line based Quadrature hybrid. Subjects and Methods: Experiments were performed on a 16. 4 T/ 26 cm horizontal bore Magnex Magnet attached to a Bruker biospec Spectrometer. The imaging gradient system has an inner diameter of 12 cms. The resonator (Figure 1) is built on Teflon cylinder with wall thickness 5 mm. It consists of 8 equally spaced λ/ 2 MTL resonators. Electromagnetic coupling among the 8 resonators makes the entire MTL volume coil resonate at the desired frequency. In this case, each resonator is tuned to 725 MHz to resonate the volume coil to 705 MHz in the unloaded condition. The <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> module consists of a diode network and a 2 stage low noise amplifier (LNA). The first stage of the LNA has PHEMT ATF 35143 and the second stage has BJT BFR 193. The <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> module has a gain of 30 dB and noise figure of 1. 1 dB at 698 MHz. Results: The losses in the receive chain is reduced by connecting the <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> module closer to the birdcage coil. An SNR gain of 1. 4 X is observed as shown in Table 1. The MTL resonator has double {{the volume of the}} birdcage resonator and has comparable SNR as that of the birdcage resonator (Table 1). The linear and combined phantom images are shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows in-vivo Axial and Sagittal rat brain RARE images with in-plane spatial resolution of 117 μm. Conclusion: A Quadrature MTL resonator with good SNR and signal uniformity has been built. This paves the way for developing actively decoupled resonators and to use smaller receive only surface coils for improved Sensitivity at 16. 4 T...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{switching}} method that occurs {{due to the}} electro-optic effect under an applied field when a beam incident on an interface between anti-parallel domains {{in a sample of}} LiNbO 3 subtends an angle greater than that required for total internal reflection (TIR). As the field increases, the induced index change present across the interface region acts to first deflect the beam towards the interface, then when the conditions are reached for <b>TR,</b> to <b>switch</b> the beam with a contrast ratio that should be extremely high, due to the intrinsic nature of the TIR process. We show results for wavelengths in the visible and at 1. 5 µm, where we obtain contrast ratios. > 20 dB, deflection angles of 8 ° per kV applied, and an effective insensitivity to wavelength when compared to other devices such as Pockels cells.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the data}} {{explosion}} coming, research on green communications experiences a {{growing interest in}} the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) world. At the same time, Time Reversal (TR) {{has been identified as}} a good green candidate owing to its low-complexity and its ability to focus energy in both spatial and temporal domains allowing for reduction of interference between users and to improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) gains. Nevertheless, applying TR requires channel estimation at the transmitter side and therefore induces overhead in packet-switched system because of the sounding frames transmission. In this paper, we propose a very simple method to apply <b>TR</b> for packet <b>switching</b> under green constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed system offers a good compromise between the physical layer energy-efficiency gains owing to focusing properties of TR and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer additional consumption due to the overhead caused by the sounding frames. The influence of different channel estimation protocols and medium access methods are studied leading to some recommendations. We also describe the application of TR to Multi-Users Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MU-MISO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) packet-switching system. The expected green performance of TR is then confirmed by link level simulations...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnDesign {{challenges}} and solution methods for Watt-level UHF CMOS power amplifiers are presented. Using the methods, a fully-integrated UHF (400 MHz) CMOS power amplifier (PA) {{with more than}} 1 -Watt output is demonstrated {{for the first time}} in Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) process. The design techniques are extended for a two-stage five-chip 5 -Watt CMOS PA. In the 1 -Watt PA, a differential stacked PMOS structure with floating-bias and a 1 : 3 turns-ratio output transformer are chosen to overcome low breakdown voltage (Vbk) of CMOS and chip area consumption issues at UHF frequencies. The high Q on-chip transformer on sapphire substrate enables the differential PA to drive a single-ended antenna effectively at 400 MHz. The PA is designed for a surface-to-orbit proximity link microtransceiver, used on Mars exploration rovers, aerobots and small networked landers. In a standard package the PA delivers 30 dBm output with 27 % PAE. No performance degradation was observed in continuous wave (CW) operation with various output terminations and the PA was tested to 136 % of its nominal 3. 3 V supply without failure. Stability analysis and measurements show that the PA is stable in normal operation. It is also shown that the PA is thermally reliable. In the microtransceiver circuits, the PA works in conjunction with transmit/receive (<b>TR)</b> <b>switch</b> to allow nearly the full 1 -Watt to reach the antenna. The 1 -Watt PA design is also leveraged to demonstrate a power-combined two-stage five-chip PA. The 1 -Watt PA’s output balun is modified for the four-transformer combining. Four identical chips are wire-bonded in the output stage and the fifth identical chip is added as a drive-amplifier. Despite low efficiency due to damaged bias circuits, the PA provides 5 -Watt output power (37 dBm) at 480 MHz with 17 % PAE with 17 dB gain. The PA layout is carried out considering full integration on a 7 × 10 mm 2 die. It will be the highest output CMOS PA ever reported once the full integration is implemented. The research contributes to state of the art by developing design-techniques for a <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> and PAs on SOS process. The resonant <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> technique is applied to a full transceiver and the multi turns-ratio on-chip transformer is used in PA’s output matching network for the first time.

40|$|Array antennas {{are used}} {{extensively}} in remote sensing applications, where a highly directive beam {{is needed to}} scan a particular area of interest {{on the surface of}} the earth. The research presented here focuses on the design of different microstrip patch antenna arrays to be used in environmental sensing applications in the X and Ka frequency bands, such as measurements in Snow and Cold Land Processes (SCLP) to detect snow accumulation, snow melt, etc. The goal of this research is to produce highly integrated, low loss, and compact size antenna arrays, while maintaining low power consumption. Multilayer organic (MLO) System-on-a-Package (SOP) technology, using laminates such as Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) and RT/Duroid®, provides a lightweight and low cost 3 D solution for the fabrication of the antenna arrays. The elements of the antenna arrays are rectangular patches. Two feeding mechanisms, aperture coupling and via feed, were implemented and compared. For the RF distribution network and interconnects, a corporate feed approach was used with reactive T-junctions, Wilkinson dividers, or both, for power division. The feed networks were designed using microstrip. The basic multilayer antenna array design consists of 3 layers of cladded laminate material. The metal layers are as follows: 1) patch antennas, 2) ground plane, 3) feed network, and 4) surface-mount components. The surface mount components would include LNA, PA, <b>TR</b> <b>switch</b> and phase shifter. M. S.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{types and}} parameters of memories used in communication engineering. The memory is a device which {{is able to}} record and to save information for the certain period of time. The memory is used in computers, measuring devices, consumer electronics etc. Main parameters of the memory are capacity, data stream speed, price of bit and time of memory cycle. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with two types of memory – external and internal. External memories are removable media such as discs and magnetic tapes used for information saving and data backup for longtime period. Inner memories – in the form of semiconductive components – are mostly attached to the main panel. There are two types of inner memories – RAM (random access memory) and ROM (read only memory). The memories could be further divided according to their dependence on feeding used for memory saving. Types of memories used in switching exchanges are also mentioned in this part. The next part discusses the scheme of T switch for the first level of European PDH E 1. The space switch and the time switch T belongs to switches used in digital switching exchange. In this part, the T switch, in particular the <b>switch</b> <b>TR</b> with controlled reading and the switch TW with controlled writing are described into details such as its parameters and methods of control. Furthermore, the calculation of call memory and control memory extant in E 1 and E 2 hierarchy are presented as well as the memory reading time and writing time of T switch in E 1 and E 2 hierarchy.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{replicase}} translational operator (TR) stem loop of the RNA MS 2 bacteriophage. Single stranded RNA (ss RNA) viruses are important organisms as they represent pathogenic species in {{all walks of life}} including a number of clinically important species such as HIV, Marburg Virus and Ebola. MS 2 provides a great model system in which to study regulatory pathways affected by RNA folds due to the extensive biochemical and structural data available. In MS 2 the TR stem loop acts as an allosteric switch, via a sequence specific recognition event involving the phage coat protein. Binding of the coat protein dimer to <b>TR</b> signals a <b>switch</b> in the life cycle of the phage from replication to assembly and release. Binding of the coat protein dimer leads to translational repression the viral replicase cistron and also leads to an allosteric conformational change in the protein. TR also contains the AUG start codon for replicase gene and thus is involved in the regulatory pathway of the cistron. Thus any insight to how the folds in the RNA effect binding or translational repression are important for understanding the MS 2 virus and other ssRNA viruses like it. The folding ensembles present in solution for a series of RNA oligonucleotides that encompass TR have been examined. Single molecule fluorescence assays suggest that these RNAs exist in solution as differentially base paired/stacked states at equilibrium. What emerges from the experimental is data consistent with an unfolding mechanism in which interruptions to the A- form duplex such as the single stranded loop, the free ends and bulged base of TR, act as nucleation points of unfolding. Additionally substitution of a uracil to a cytosine in the loop causes heterogeneity in the folded and unfolded ensembles relative to the wild-type molecule. This data is used to study folding of the RNAs by 'steered' molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These show remarkable agreement with experimental data and provide atomistic detail on the molecular interactions which take place during the unfolding pathways studied. The adopted conformers for each simulation provide details about hydrogen bonding between the base pairs of the stem and confirm predicted conformers from apparent dye separation in FRET experiments.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel electro-optically addressable total internal reflection (<b>TR)</b> <b>switch</b> {{in a sample of}} Limos that has been engineered to have a sharp boundary between two anti-parallel domain regions [1]. Such a switch can provide numerous advantages including ease of fabrication, the possibility of high contrast ratios (TIR is a 100 % efficient process), relatively low drive voltages, and a wavelength dependence that is superior to other electro-optic devices such as Pockels cells. The LiNbO 3 sample is z-cut, and has been patterned and electric-field poled to produce equal areas of oppositely oriented domain regions. The boundary region should ideally be very smooth, and free from residual poling-induced strain. In our case we observe a static index difference at the boundary, this affects the choice of angle for the grazing incidence beam and hence the contrast achievable experimentally. When an external electric field is applied to this boundary, equal magnitude refractive index changes of opposite sign will occur between the adjacent domain regions. If the value of index change is sufficiently large TIR can occur for the incident beam, thereby leading to switching of beam direction at the boundary from transmission to reflection. A schematic for the switch can be seen below in figure 1. (Schematic of switch.) Light incident on the boundary at an angle that is less than the angle for TIR will be transmitted through it. If however the light is incident on the boundary at angles greater than the TIR angle then it will be reflected with a theoretical efficiency of 100 %. As the device consists of anti-parallel regions within a single electro-optic composite crystal the incident beam will only see a change in refractive index when a suitable field is applied. We will discuss results achieved for electro-optically modified reflectivity versus applied electric field, for light of s and p polarisations, and wavelengths in the visible and the near I. R. Initial results have already shown a contrast ratio of greater than 20 dB which we expect to be improved with the optimization of annealing, manufacturing and design parameters. To conclude, we have constructed a domain engineered electro-optic total internal reflection switch in a sample of LiNbO 3. This novel switching approach can be further improved and optimized, but already shows a good switching contrast ratio and the possibility for practical device implementation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two {{separate}} fields of microwave technology. The first section treats microwave characterization and applications of high temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films, {{while the second}} section treats microwave breakdown in transmit-receive (TR) switches and in air. Within the first section, four main topics are adressed. The first topic deals with non-destructive characterization of the surface impedance of HTS films. Two methods are investigated: the dielectric rod resonator method and the parallel-plate resonator method. Calibration measurements show that surface resistance measurements can be performed at 10 GHz {{in the range from}} 15 µ. OMEGA. to 100 µ. OMEGA. using both methods. Good agreement is obtained between a microstrip resonator method and the two non-destructive methods. The parallel-plate resonator is used as a fast non-destructive microwave characterization method for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) films grown on (001) yttria-stabilized ZrO 2 substrates, in order to optimize film deposition parameters. The second topic involves an analytical formulation for calculation of the quasi-static propagation parameters of HTS coplanar waveguides and striplines. The resistance and kinetic inductance per unit length of the line is calculated for HTS film thicknesses comparable to the penetration depth. The third topic deals with a YBCO microstrip modulator, which is based on the transition from the superconductive (S) state to the normal (N) state of current controlled YBCO film elements. The elements are used as terminations of a 3 dB hybrid coupler and work as shorts or terminations depending on state. The actual material parameters of the used YBCO films differ most likely from those used in the simulations, which can be deduced from the small measured difference in insertion loss between the S- and N-states. The fourth topic involves measurements and modeling of the frequency and quality factor of high quality YBCO thin film coplanar resonators as function of dc bias in the center strip conductor. Agreement between experiments and the results of a current-dependent coupled-grain model has been obtained. Within the second section, two topics are investigated. The first topic deals with a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the <b>TR</b> <b>switch.</b> It is shown that the characteristic physical phenomena which appear in connection with microwave breakdown of the filling gas as well as the subsequent interaction between the microwave and the breakdown plasma, can be described very well in terms of qualitative and quantitative physical models. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from a number of experiments involving continuous and pulsed incident powers. The second topic of this section involves an investigation of the breakdown properties of high-power microwave pulses propagating in air. A simple analytical modeling of the breakdown-induced pulse erosion phenomenon is made by use of empirical approximations for the ionization frequency of the microwave. The theoretical predictions are compared and found to be in good agreement with experimental results...|$|E
