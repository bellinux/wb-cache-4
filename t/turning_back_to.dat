5|$|The July 1, 1919, {{incarnation}} of M-89 was much shorter relative to today's road. Its western terminus {{was at a}} junction with M-11 (later US31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few {{miles south of the}} present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US131 freeway.|$|E
5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway.

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E
5|$|With warm {{waters and}} {{favorable}} upper-level conditions, Helinda attained cyclone status on February1, and the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), slightly below its estimate for the cyclone's peak winds in the Australian region. Due to a powerful ridge near Île Amsterdam, Helinda {{turned to the}} southeast on February2, where cooler water temperatures induced weakening. Two days later, strong wind shear contributed to further weakening, and the storm deteriorated to tropical depression status. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west, the circulation was declared dissipated by the MFR on February7, although the JTWC continued tracking Helinda until February14 when the system was off the northeast coast of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far enough {{to the north of the}} Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} {{accelerated}} {{the rate of}} weakening, causing Blanca's mid- and low-level circulation centers to decouple. By 18:00UTC on June7, the hurricane degraded to a tropical storm. Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, the system briefly emerged back over the Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{campaign}} then began. Rupert crossed back into the Atlantic and, during 1651, cut west to the Azores, capturing vessels as he went. He intended to continue on to the West Indies, where there would be many rich targets. Instead he encountered a late summer storm, leading to the sinking of the Constant Reformation with the loss of 333 lives—almost including Rupert's brother, Prince Maurice, who only just escaped—and a great deal of captured treasure. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> regroup, repair and re-equip in early 1652, Rupert's reduced force moored at Cape Blanc, an island near what is now Mauritania. Rupert took the opportunity to explore and acquired a Moorish servant boy, who remained in his service for many years. Rupert also explored 150 miles up the Gambia River, taking two Spanish vessels as prizes and contracting malaria in the process.|$|E
5|$|US-60 {{would be}} realigned through {{many of the}} towns it served in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The highway was {{adjusted}} through Fairland to use Connor Avenue, a shorter, straighter route through town; this change was approved on July 11, 1949. The highway's route through Nowata was altered next, on November 13, 1950. Previously, US-60 followed Delaware Avenue to Oak Street, where it turned south, before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the east on Cherokee Avenue; after the change, it turns south on Pine Street and joins Cherokee Avenue further west. On the same date, the highway was realigned through Bartlesville. The US-60 system through Ponca City was next to be reworked, on July 14, 1952. The previous US-60 and US-77 Belt Line routes and City Routes were removed {{in favor of a}} new US-60 route bypassing the city to the south on Harding Avenue and proceeding east across a new Arkansas River bridge—the present day route. Further west, US-60 and US-177 were realigned in Tonkawa on May 4, 1953, replacing an alternate US-60/US-177 that previously paralleled the main highway there.|$|E

5|$|After <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa {{became even}} more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, {{the bulk of the}} convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|M-66 {{continues}} northward through Barry County on Capital Avenue {{which becomes}} 9 Mile Road north of Baseline Road. The highway passes through Assyria before meeting M-79, {{with which it}} has a short concurrency, in Nashville. On {{the north side of}} the village, M-66 crosses the Thornapple River and continues north through mixed rural forest land and farm fields. Near Woodland, M-66 joins M-43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry–Eaton county line. M-43/M-66 meets M-50 at a four-way intersection southwest of Lake Odessa near Woodbury, and M-43 turns east leaving M-66 in favor of a concurrency with M-50. M-66 crosses a rail line of CSX Transportation and the county line on State Road. It meets I-96 in a rural southern part of the Ionia County south of Ionia. On the south edge of town, the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street. While entering downtown Ionia, the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the abandoned mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county fairgrounds. M-66 turns west along M-21 (Lincoln Avenue) for two blocks before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north along State Street. The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M-44's eastern terminus near Woodard Lake.|$|E
