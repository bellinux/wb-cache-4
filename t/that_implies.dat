25|$|Lacan's {{concept of}} desire {{is related to}} Hegel's Begierde, a term <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> a {{continuous}} force, and therefore somehow differs from Freud's concept of Wunsch.

25|$|Howard Carter {{writes in}} his {{description}} of Tutankhamun's tomb that the Pharaoh's earlobes were perforated, but no earrings were inside the wrappings, although the tomb contained some.

25|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} in applications of linear algebra to physics, the Einstein notation or Einstein summation convention is a notational convention <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> summation over {{a set of}} indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving notational brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of Ricci calculus; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between tangent and cotangent spaces. It was introduced to physics by Albert Einstein in 1916.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the informational quality of implied volatility in forecasting future realized volatility using daily S&P 500 and S&P 100 index option prices from 2000 to 2006. In contrast to many previous studies, we find <b>that</b> <b>implied</b> volatility is an unbiased and efficient estimator of future realized volatility. Unlike implied volatility estimates; both historical and conditional volatility estimates using GARCH and EGARCH models possess limited explanatory power. A delta-hedged trading strategy with long positions in calls, however, generates significantly negative profits <b>that</b> <b>imply</b> a misspecification of constant volatility models. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>implied</b> volatility estimates from constant volatility models contain valuable information, even though the model might be misspecified. ...|$|R

25|$|Likewise, cadences can be {{classified}} as either transient (a pause, like a comma in a linguistic sentence, <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> the piece will continue after a brief lift in the voice) or terminal (more conclusive, like a period, that indicates the sentence is done). Most transient cadences are half cadences (which stop momentarily on a dominant chord), though IAC or deceptive cadences are also usually transient, as well as Phrygian cadences. Terminal cadences are normally perfect, and rarely plagal.|$|E
25|$|By 1962, Rauschenberg's {{paintings}} {{were beginning to}} incorporate not only found objects but found images as well - photographs transferred to the canvas {{by means of the}} silkscreen process. Previously used only in commercial applications, silkscreen allowed Rauschenberg to address the multiple reproducibility of images, and the consequent flattening of experience <b>that</b> <b>implies.</b> In this respect, his work is contemporaneous with that of Andy Warhol, and both Rauschenberg and Johns are frequently cited as important forerunners of American Pop Art.|$|E
25|$|Still, as the U.S. economy {{begins to}} recover, America {{might still be}} too skeptical to {{increase}} imports from Mexico right away. With American consumers spending less money, it may be likely {{that the government will}} choose to do the same. The United States may disregard the struggling state of Mexico in order to fulfill its own self-interest which will further devastate Mexico. It is this type of influential relationship <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> that U.S. imperialism has yet to cease along the southern border.|$|E

25|$|Some {{publications}} that oppose same-sex marriage, such as WorldNetDaily and Baptist Press, have an editorial style policy of placing the word marriage in scare quotes ("marriage") {{when it is}} used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice. Cliff Kincaid of the conservative Accuracy in Media argued for use of quotation marks {{on the grounds that}} marriage was a legal status denied same-sex couples by most U.S. state governments. Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> illegitimacy.|$|E
25|$|Several {{concepts}} of a derivative {{may be defined}} on a Banach space. See the articles on the Fréchet derivative and the Gâteaux derivative for details. The Fréchet derivative allows for {{an extension of the}} concept of a directional derivative to Banach spaces. The Gâteaux derivative allows for an extension of a directional derivative to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability. The quasi-derivative is another generalization of directional derivative <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability.|$|E

His right hand is raised and his finger extended to point towards the lamb, a gesture <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> that he is reciting the Agnus Dei.

25|$|The obvious {{disadvantage}} to {{this design}} {{is the cost}} and complexity of two drive trains, and the increased maintenance load <b>that</b> <b>implies.</b> Another is that if one engine fails, the other cannot be used to drive both tracks. Both of these problems were greatly reduced {{in the case of}} steam power, where the majority of the engine in terms of size and weight is the boiler, and the cylinders that extract that power are much smaller in comparison. It can also provide variable output by controlling the amount of steam sent to each cylinder. It is much more complex when used with internal combustion engines.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have drilled {{only about}} 1.5km into the 6- to 7-kilometer-thick oceanic crust, so their {{understanding}} of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of in situ oceanic crust. Oceanic crust has a layered velocity structure <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> a layered rock series similar to that listed above. In detail there are problems, with many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges. Seismic sounding of mid-ocean ridges has revealed only a few magma chambers beneath ridges, and these are quite thin. A few deep drill holes into oceanic crust have intercepted gabbro, {{but it is not}} layered like ophiolite gabbro.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{diversity}} and population {{structure in the}} American land mass using DNA micro-satellite markers (genotype) sampled from North, Central, and South America have been analyzed against similar data available from other indigenous populations worldwide. The Amerindian populations show a lower genetic diversity than populations from other continental regions. Observed is both a decreasing genetic diversity as geographic distance from the Bering Strait occurs and a decreasing genetic similarity to Siberian populations from Alaska (genetic entry point). Also observed is evidence of {{a higher level of}} {{diversity and}} lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America. A relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations is a scenario <b>that</b> <b>implies</b> coastal routes were easier than inland routes for migrating peoples (Paleo-Indians) to traverse. The overall pattern that is emerging suggests that the Americas were recently colonized by a small number of individuals (effective size of about 70), and then they grew by a factor of 10 over 800 – 1000 years. The data also show that there have been genetic exchanges between Asia, the Arctic and Greenland since the initial peopling of the Americas.|$|E
