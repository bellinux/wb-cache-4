Cortana reveals that Halo's activation would mean their own destruction. Master Chief and Cortana instead detonate Autumns engines, destroying Halo and preventing the escape of the Flood.|$|E
5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 war was {{the first}} time since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Russian {{military}} had been used against an independent state, demonstrating Russia's willingness <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> full-scale military campaign to attain its political objectives. The failure of the Western security system to respond swiftly to Russia's attempt to forcibly revise the borders of an OSCE member country revealed its weaknesses. The division between Western European and Eastern European nations also became apparent over the relations with Russia. Ukraine and other post-Soviet states received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign invasion and the break-up of the country. Effective annexation of Abkhazia was also one of Russia's geopolitical goals. The construction of the EU-sponsored Nabucco pipeline connecting Central Asian reserves to Europe in Transcaucasia was averted.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated at {{negotiations}} with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the Darul Islam and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, {{the location of the}} temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Second World War, Johnston was a slow-medium and left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler, {{but during}} a practice session, he bowled a quicker ball to Jack Ryder a former Australian captain and Test batsman, {{who was now}} a Victorian and national selector. This prompted Ryder <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. At the same time, Richmond captain Jack Ledward wanted him to bowl spin. Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945–46, Johnston made his first-class debut against Queensland and was entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. His maiden wicket was that of leading Test batsman Bill Brown. Johnston took a total of 1/84 in a ten-wicket win. He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball, {{and that he would}} be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older. He played a total of seven matches for the season and took 12 wickets at 35.08, with his best performance being 4/43 against arch-rivals New South Wales. As a result, he missed the national selection for the tour to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>a</b> war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E
