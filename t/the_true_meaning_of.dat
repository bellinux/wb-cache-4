25|$|The modern Hebrew {{calendar}} {{follows a}} seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently but {{independently of the}} monthly and annual cycles.

25|$|The {{ordinary}} Bohra {{is highly}} conscious of his identity, {{and this is}} especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the back like {{the hood of a}} jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{meaningful}} e-marketplace (MEMP) is {{a common}} business information space where computer agents can faithfully deliver <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> e-trade with each other {{on behalf of their}} human masters. Partial understanding of any received e-trade information is forbidden since it hides unfavorable legal consequences. MEMP is a new concept. This paper discusses it by putting forward a framework, which consists of four important procedures of design, reification, transformation and inference. The important features of MEMP are representation personalization and localization, accurate cross-domain message exchange, true result reasoning, context-based reification, and model-free template design and use. In future, a successful realization of MEMP in design will drastically change our existing e-trade modes, lift the quality of e-business, and lead to a more efficient e-marketplace brought by higher accuracy <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> understanding, broader scope of business interaction, and richer e-trade functions...|$|R
