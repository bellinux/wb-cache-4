5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> system is still in use.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
5000|$|Elton John's {{video for}} his 1990 song [...] "You Gotta Love Someone", also {{directed}} by Morahan, {{is very similar}} to this video and features <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting,</b> locations and camera angles.|$|R
5000|$|Smoke Bombs use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> {{technology}} as <b>the</b> hand grenade, with a reverse {{side to the}} cap which you must strike against the fuse. When a smoke bomb is lit, it releases coloured smoke for about 2 minutes, to provide cover, or smoke out other paintball players.|$|R
50|$|The {{parallel}} palette (invented by David Kassan) is {{a palette}} for oil painting, mounted vertically {{adjacent to the}} painting, so that the paints on the palette are in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> as on <b>the</b> canvas, and so that the artist can look directly {{back and forth between}} subject, canvas, and palette.|$|R
5|$|The {{new company}} {{was unable to}} raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had been given only five years by Parliament to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was due to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received the Royal Assent for a revised and much cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), this envisaged the extension being built to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> specifications as the existing Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} or not native Hawaiians should be considered in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> as Native Americans.|$|E

5000|$|Flash Bangs {{are more}} often seen on airsoft days. The flash bang has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> {{technique}} as <b>the</b> hand grenade and smoke bomb, but after the fuse has been lit, it sparks a bright white flash to temporarily blind the opposition, or any other players that were staring at the pyrotechnic when it went off.|$|R
50|$|Antimachus II did {{not strike}} a {{portrait}} on his coins, likely {{since this was}} not custom in India. Neither did the early kings strike tetradrachms. Antimachus II struck {{a large number of}} bilingual drachms on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighter</b> Indian standard as Apollodotus I, though round in shape. On the obverse is Nike, and on the reverse a king on horseback.|$|R
25|$|In {{another example}} of {{aggressive}} mimicry, males are lured toward {{what seems to be}} a sexually receptive female, only to be eaten. For example, fireflies of the genus Photuris emit <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> signals that females of the genus Photinus emit as a mating signal.|$|E
25|$|In {{accord with}} the {{prevailing}} sentiment of the time, Morphy esteemed chess only as an amateur activity, considering the game unworthy of pursuit as a serious occupation. Chess professionals were viewed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> as professional gamblers. It was not until decades later that {{the age of the}} professional chess player arrived.|$|E
25|$|Illumination of the {{phosphor}} {{is achieved}} using UV light. Most thermographic phosphors absorb {{light in a}} broad band in the UV and therefore can be excited using a YAG:Nd laser. Theoretically, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> can be used both for PIV and temperature measurements, but this would mean that UV-sensitive cameras are needed. In practice, two different beams originated in separate lasers are overlapped. While one of the beams is used for velocity measurements, the other is {{used to measure the}} temperature.|$|E
50|$|The No 16 is {{essentially}} an improved version of the No 15. Instead of a ball shape, it has an oval shape and has less explosive charge. It was planned to completely replace the No 15, but the defeat at Loos caused both the No 15 and No 16 to be withdrawn from service, as they both had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|One {{reference}} capture technique, {{sometimes referred}} to as [...] "wickmania" [...] by camera technicians and VFX supervisors, involves shooting footage of two small spheres (one matte, one of a light-reflective material) on a physical set. This is used when the IBL will be later applied to an animated object or character that interacts with live objects or characters under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions.|$|R
2500|$|In 1948, Davis {{was cast}} in the melodrama Winter Meeting. Although she was {{initially}} enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for [...] "softer" [...] lighting {{to be used to}} disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> technique [...] "on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, and I knew what they meant". She began to regret accepting the role.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, {{its focus}} shifted to family {{entertainment}} venues with the Laser Clay Shooting System, using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> gun technology used in Nintendo's Kousenjuu series of toys, {{and set up}} in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines (such as the light gun shooter game Wild Gunman) for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had {{to be shut down}} following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new market.|$|E
25|$|Fuji films also {{integrate}} tabular grains {{in their}} SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain {{is not only}} tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, {{the first in a}} new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.|$|E
25|$|An earlier cut of {{the film}} seems to have {{included}} a large subplot regarding aliens in the extraterrestrial sense, whose presence was made gradually more and more known throughout, and who were planning to siphon off the planet's resources gradually, placing the humans in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> as the penguins. At the end, through {{the plight of the}} main character, their hand is stayed and, instead, first contact is made. This was chopped out during the last year of production, and has yet to {{see the light of day}} in a finished form, although concept art from these sequences were showcased at the Siggraph 2007 demonstration, and are available online, as well.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{event was}} {{the set of}} nine lights {{appearing}} to [...] "hover" [...] over the city of Phoenix at around 10 pm (22:00 MST). The second event has been more thoroughly covered by the media, {{due in part to}} the numerous video images taken of the lights. This was also observed by numerous people who might have thought they were seeing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lights</b> as those reported earlier.|$|R
5000|$|George Woodcock saw Welcoming Disaster and The Boatman as similar, even complementary: [...] "They are {{narratives}} of journeys into spiritual day and night, disguised, no doubt, {{by all the}} devices of privacy, but nonetheless derived from true inner experiences." [...] Margaret Atwood emphasized their differences: [...] "If The Boatman is 'classical,' [...] [...] [...] then Welcoming Disaster is, by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lights,</b> 'romantic': more personal, more convoluted, darker and more grotesque, its rhythms more complex" ...|$|R

25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and thermal drift of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E
25|$|Later in Permian time, the Kaibab Sea {{invaded the}} land and laid down a limey ooze that later lithified to form the locally up to 200foot (60m) thick Kaibab Limestone. This is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> gray to white {{formation}} that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest (see Geology of the Grand Canyon area). The lower parts of the Kaibab were interbedded with sand and silt before its main component, limestone, was converted into chert-rich dolomite by the intrusion of magnesium. The formation contains fossils of invertebrates including brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods. Outcrops of the cliff-forming Kaibab in Capitol Reef can only {{be seen in the}} deeper canyons located in the westernmost part of the park. Retreat of the Kaibab Sea by the Mid Permian exposed its seabed to erosion, resulting in 100foot (30m) deep channels {{and the creation of a}} gap in the geologic record called an unconformity.|$|E
25|$|Royal Canadian Air Force: The Queen's colour of the RCAF is {{different}} from that of other Commonwealth air forces in that it is not based on the ensign but instead is similar to the Queen's colours of infantry regiments: it is a silk national flag of Canada with a red circlet on the maple leaf inscribed with the name of the command, surrounding the royal cipher, and ensigned with the royal crown. Uniquely among Commonwealth air forces, the Canadian air force also has a Command Colour, analogous to an infantry regimental colour. This is light blue with the command badge in the centre and a maple leaf in each corner, stems inward. Also like army units, squadrons with 25 years or more of active service receive unit colours with battle honours surrounding the unit badge on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> blue background edged with flowers.|$|E
50|$|Holmium oxide {{has some}} fairly {{dramatic}} color changes {{depending on the}} lighting conditions. In daylight, it is a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is a fiery orange red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions. <b>The</b> perceived color change {{is related to the}} sharp absorption bands of holmium interacting with a subset of the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of europium and terbium, acting as phosphors.|$|R
25|$|Refraction {{between two}} {{surfaces}} is {{also referred to}} as reversible because if all conditions were identical, the angles would be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for <b>light</b> propagating in the opposite direction.|$|R
2500|$|Since not {{everyone}} is irritated by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> sources, {{it is common for}} one person's light [...] "pollution" [...] to be light that is desirable for another. One example of this is found in advertising, when an advertiser wishes for particular lights to be bright and visible, even though others find them annoying. Other types of light pollution are more certain. For instance, light that accidentally crosses a property boundary and annoys a neighbor is generally wasted and pollutive light.|$|R
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution {{has also been}} called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff, compared here) have to be closer together to meet <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by the IESNA. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by {{reducing the number of}} luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.|$|E
25|$|Israel's then prime {{minister}} Ariel Sharon began {{a policy of}} disengagement from Gaza from the Gaza Strip in 2003. This policy was fully implemented in August 2005. Sharon's announcement to disengage from Gaza came as a tremendous shock to his critics both {{on the left and}} on the right. A year previously, he had commented that the fate of the most far-flung settlements in Gaza, Netzararem and Kfar Darom, was regarded in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> as that of Tel Aviv. The formal announcements to evacuate seventeen Gaza settlements and another four in the West Bank in February 2004 represented the first reversal for the settler movement since 1968. It divided his party. It was strongly supported by Trade and Industry Minister Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni, the Minister for Immigration and Absorption, but Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned it. It was also uncertain whether this was simply the beginning of further evacuation.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{commission was}} appointed, {{consisted of three}} regular members, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Eirik Sandberg, Police Inspector Johan Fr. Kielland and Pilot Eivind Veierstad, {{in addition to their}} secretary, Hans Georg Andersen. Arne Viik, an expert in aviation navigation, was appointed for the individual investigation. The commission's regular members were contacted at 17:00 {{on the day of the}} accident and they started their work immediately. The wreck was taken to Fornebu for investigation, the flight recorder was sent to Copenhagen and the altimeters were sent to the United States. They interviewed several hundred people, flew the flight with a similar aircraft in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>light</b> and weather conditions and by February 1973 had collected more than two and a half meters of notes and documents. Because of the navigational errors, the commission test-flew the route several times. When the beacon was transmitting false signals and they followed them without correlating by other means, the commission's test flights gave a course that would have resulted in a crash, had they not aborted.|$|E
30|$|The {{acquisition}} setup {{allows for}} {{rotation of the}} camera around the central axis of the camera lens. By rotating the camera rather than the textured surface, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions are kept throughout the image acquisition. For each texture class, one image is acquired for each orientation. The textures are imaged in the nine orientations θ∈{ 0 °, 40 °, 80 °,…, 320 ° } chosen not to be even multiples of 90 ° for which the choice of interpolation methods would not make a difference.|$|R
