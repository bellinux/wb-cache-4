25|$|At {{one of the}} {{meetings}} during the reformation Anderson and his step-daughter confessed that they had committed adultery, believing when they did so that Brigham Young {{would allow them to}} marry when he learned the facts. Their confession being full, they were rebaptized and received into full membership. They were then placed under covenant that if they again committed adultery, Anderson should suffer death. Soon after this a charge was laid against Anderson before the Council, accusing him of adultery with his step-daughter...the Council voted that Anderson must die for violating his covenants. Klingensmith went to Anderson and notified him that the orders were that he must die by having his throat cut, so that the running of his blood would atone for his sins. Anderson, being a firm believer in the doctrines and teachings of <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church,</b> made no objections, but asked for half a day to prepare for death. His request was granted. His wife was ordered to prepare a suit of clean clothing, in which to have her husband buried, and was informed that he was to be killed for his sins, she being directed to tell those who should enquire after her husband that he had gone to California.|$|E
500|$|In a few {{accounts}} of Brannan's {{dealings with the}} LDS church {{it is said that}} Brigham Young sent the apostle Amasa Lyman to collect the tithing money that Brannan had withheld from the church's institution. When Lyman arrived Brannan was unable to account for the tithes that Brigham Young and other Mormons claimed were given to him or that he owed from his own personal income. He reportedly told them, [...] "You go back and tell Brigham Young that I'll give up the Lord's money when he sends me a receipt signed by the Lord", although historians, such as Will Bagley have found this is likely just legend. In another account, Lyman was sent to gather $10,000 of owed tithing from Brannan (or more if he was willing).

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily {{populated}} by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church,</b> which held great sway over Mormons voters. Because {{the vast majority}} of the population was Mormon, people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. The segregation between Mormons and non-Mormons (at the time called [...] "Gentiles") became very apparent. As a non-Mormon woman there were few ways to meet other women, whereas, the women of <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> had the Relief Society to build friendships and expend energy. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and friends back in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club back in Salt Lake City which was organized in 1875 and called the Blue Tea. It was Utah's first women's club. The Blue Tea's first president was Froiseth (1876) who set a cap of 25 members. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating [...] "mental culture" [...] within its members. A few women would be assigned to read a book or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read. Then the club would debate over those ideas. Froiseth described the Blue Tea's first year: [...] "we did good work, had some fine programmes, necessitating not a little reading and study, and the meetings went so well that there was rarely a vacant chair". Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society.

2500|$|After {{the missionaries}} left French Polynesia, church members faced {{harassment}} from some {{government officials and}} members of the Catholic Church. In 1867, general religious toleration was established in Polynesia which eventually led to the return of missionaries in the territory. In 1892, missionaries were able to return to the islands. Joseph W. Damron and William A. Seegmiller were the missionaries who were assigned to return to the islands. They found that many of the members who had joined the church in the mid-1800s had fallen away. Joseph F. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency, called James S. Brown, who was Pratt's mission companion in 1849, to be the new mission president when it reopened. Brown accepted. Upon his arrival to the islands, he discovered that there were some members who had remained faithful but that many had joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Eventually, Brown and the missionaries who accompanied him were successful in re-baptizing many Tahitians into <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church.</b>|$|E

Alex Cooper, a lesbian Mormon teen who beginning in 2010 was subjected to physically abusive conversion therapy techniques in an attempt to change her sexual orientation, reported attempting suicide. Mormon composer Michael McLean also stated that his gay son was suicidal during the church's California campaign to ban same-sex marriage.

2500|$|Arthur Conan Doyle's {{detective novel}} A Study in Scarlet (1887) is another {{portrayal}} that caused controversy. Mormons viewed {{the portrayal of}} the Danites in the book as highly erroneous, being yet another instance of anti-Mormon antagonism in popular media. Conan Doyle, according to his daughter, had relied upon what had been published about Mormons by former Mormons (historians believing these probably to be Fannie Stenhouse, William A. Hickman, William Jarman, John Hyde, and Ann Eliza Young), believing those accounts to be factual. Conan Doyle visited the United States in 1923, and one leg of his lecture tour {{took him to the}} University of Utah, to lecture on spiritualism. During his stay he received a letter from a Dr. G. Hodgson Higgins, who had formed his impressions of Mormonism based upon the portrayal in A Study in Scarlet, which [...] "gave the impression that murder was a common practice among them", and who suggested that Conan Doyle [...] "express his regret at having propagated falsehoods about <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> and people". Conan Doyle refused to withdraw what he had written about the Danites and the murders, {{on the grounds that it}} was a matter of historical record, but stated that his treatment in the novel was more [...] "lurid" [...] than the treatment by a history textbook would have been, and promised that in the future his portrayals of the Latter-day Saints would be based upon his firsthand experience of them on his visit. Subsequent Mormon characters in Conan Doyle's work were indeed more sympathetic.|$|E

However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L.

Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins.
