5|$|The wings lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. <b>The</b> <b>fore</b> wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E

5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute.

5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> wings.

5|$|Although {{bands like}} Sarcofago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.|$|E

From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French.
