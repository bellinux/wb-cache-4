25|$|This service {{begins with}} the Barechu, the formal public call to prayer, and Shema Yisrael embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and {{followers}} of the Vilna Gaon) then add another blessing (Baruch Adonai le-Olam), which is made from a tapestry of biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim {{in and out of}} Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the Shemoneh Esreh (Amidah), bracketed with the full Kaddish. Sephardim <b>then</b> <b>say</b> Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat Barechu before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with Aleinu followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).|$|E
25|$|Given a lattice with {{a bottom}} element 0 {{and a top}} element 1, a pair x,y of {{elements}} is called complementary when x∧y= 0 and x∨y= 1, and we <b>then</b> <b>say</b> that y is a complement of x and vice versa. Any element x of a distributive lattice with top and bottom can have at most one complement. When every element of a lattice has a complement the lattice is called complemented. It follows that in a complemented distributive lattice, the complement of an element always exists and is unique, making complement a unary operation. Furthermore, every complemented distributive lattice forms a Boolean algebra, and conversely every Boolean algebra forms a complemented distributive lattice. This provides an alternative definition of a Boolean algebra, namely as any complemented distributive lattice. Each of these three properties can be axiomatized with finitely many equations, whence these equations taken together constitute a finite axiomatization of the equational theory of Boolean algebras.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{their return}} Ketil's eldest son, Thorgil begins to make ready for war and inform every {{man in the}} Ketil's farm that enemies are coming to attack. Ketil is {{depressed}} because of the incident with Canute but discovers that Arneis tried to escape with her former husband and so begins to violently beat her. Ketil begins to make war on Canute but when the young king arrives on the Ketil farm it turns out Ketil receives more than he bargained for; the kings soldiers begin to brutally hack Ketil's men down or severely mutilate them. Ketil himself receives {{a blow to the}} head by an axe. During the commotion Leif Erikson arrives at the farm with his apprentice, Full-eyes, and offers Thorfinn and Einar to return home with him. They begin to carry Arneis with them only to find she is unable to travel due to the extent of her injuries. She dies, thanking Thorfinn & Einar for their kindness. Thorfinn then decides to talk with Canute before leaving to Iceland. Einar follows Thorfinn to where Canute and his men are but then are stopped before speaking with him. After Thorfinn endures a hundred punches the soldiers allow him to speak with Canute. After a brief conversation during which Canute is inspired by the formerly merciless Thorfinn's new-found devotion to a life of peace, Canute has a change of heart and spares the farmers. Thorfinn and Einar <b>then</b> <b>say</b> their goodbyes to Ketil's father and Snake before sailing back to Iceland with Leif where Thorfinn is reunited with his mother and sister.|$|E

There they met with Martić, RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelić and foreign minister Milan Babić. Martić refused to receive the draft before the UN Security Council issued a written statement extending the UNPROFOR mandate to protect the RSK. Kerestedjiants and Ahrens suggested that Martić should acknowledge receipt of the plan and <b>then</b> <b>say</b> that the RSK would not negotiate before the UNPROFOR issue was resolved, but he refused. The diplomats then attempted to meet Milošević in Belgrade about the matter, but Milošević refused to see them and the group returned to Zagreb the next day.
