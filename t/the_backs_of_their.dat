5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shirts. Originally {{a team of}} players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number {{for the duration of}} a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads on their preen glands {{to pick up}} an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling {{the skin of the}} throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of}} the rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
25|$|For the 2007 season, {{all members}} of the Patriots wore a black No.91 decal on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> helmets. A friend of Hill's since high school, fellow Patriots {{defensive}} lineman Jarvis Green supported Hill's fiancée Inell Benn and son Ma’Shy financially following Hill's death.

25|$|Adult tapirs {{are large}} enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> necks helps {{to protect them from}} threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, {{considering}} their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; both the Brazilian tapir and the Malayan tapir are classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir and the mountain tapir are endangered.|$|E

25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{tensions}} in Lycoming County were also {{at a high}} {{in the years following}} the Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842. Hughes was forced to lead the slaves under the cover of darkness. Local bounty hunters and professional slave catchers from the south sought to capture any slaves that they could. Hughes and his sons tried to work on moonless nights. They also would stretch horse hairs across the trails; the horse hairs were difficult to see, and would cause the slave catchers to be thrown off <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> horses, either slowing their pursuit or deterring it entirely. Hughes led the fugitive slaves from his home to the next station in Lewis Township near the hamlet of Trout Run on Lycoming Creek. From there the slaves would work their way north to Elmira, New York and eventually to freedom in Canada.|$|E
25|$|During the autumn, all {{red deer}} {{subspecies}} grow thicker coats of hair, which helps to insulate {{them during the}} winter. Autumn is also {{when some of the}} stags grow their neck manes. The autumn/winter coat of most subspecies are most distinct. The Caspian red deer's winter coat is greyer and has a larger and more distinguished light rump-patch (like wapiti and some central Asian red deer) compared to the Western European red deer, which has more of a greyish-brown coat with a darker yellowish rump patch in the winter. By the time summer begins, the heavy winter coat has been shed; the animals are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. Red deer have different colouration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with grey or lighter colouration prevalent in the winter and more reddish and darker coat colouration in the summer. Most European red deer have reddish-brown summer coats, and some individuals may have a few spots on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> summer coats.|$|E

500|$|The {{coach has}} been the subject of sophomoric humor, mainly due to his surname's {{resemblance}} to the vulgar word cunt. A 2010 Bleacher Report article said that his name was [...] "hands down the best name ever. So many jokes, so little time." [...] In April 2013, The Big Lead wrote about the name after a photo depicted Kuntz standing to the right of White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko and Royals baserunner Chris Getz.

500|$|He {{returned}} to writing scripts for British television, including Gentry with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat {{broadcast of the}} production on Channel 4 for The Times in 1994, wrote that: [...] "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But {{it will be an}} interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw The Woman in Black last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> necks." [...] The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, {{had not been able to}} complete the work due to his age.|$|E
500|$|Trost {{designed}} the costumes to be distinct from one another. JTRO and BTRO wear very similar costumes, the only noticeable difference being a color inversion. Both costumes had American flag-like emblems on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> jackets, further enforcing {{the identification of}} the 248 with the Union. At the end of the film, JTRO takes BTRO's outfit, which required Trost to readjust it for the height difference between Jason Trost and Brandon Barrera, who portray JTRO and BTRO, respectively. As the film progresses, JTRO's color scheme changes from black and blue to military green to reflect his [...] "becoming one with BLT". KCDC's (Art Hsu) costume was designed with ducks, referencing a speech in the film in which he notes the lack of ducks in the FP. Stacy (Caitlyn Folley) and her father (Sean Whalen) are both dressed to be somewhat transsexual, though it is more prominent in her father's character. Whalen told Trost he would wear anything as long as his nipple was exposed at all times. Stacy also wears an I Love New York shirt, with the words New York covered in duct tape and [...] "The FP" [...] written over it with a marker. CC Jam's (Clifton Collins, Jr.) costume was designed to be as colorful as possible to emulate rave culture.|$|E

At a sufficient distance from a nuclear explosion, the blast wave produces similar results to these natural phenomena, so similar countermeasures are taken. In areas where earthquakes are common, a countermeasure known as [...] "Drop, Cover, and Hold On!" [...] is practiced. Likewise, in tornado-prone areas of the United States, especially those within Tornado Alley, tornado drills involve teaching children to move closer {{to the floor and}} to cover <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads to prevent injury from flying debris.

There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plough their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease.

2500|$|Female {{red deer}} reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2 years of age. Red deer mating patterns usually involve {{a dozen or}} more mating attempts before the first successful one. There may be several more matings before the stag will seek out another mate in his harem. Red deer are among mammals exhibiting homosexual behavior. Females in their second autumn can produce one or very rarely two offspring per year. The gestation period is 240 to 262 days, and the offspring weigh about [...] After two weeks, calves are able to join the herd and are fully weaned after two months. All red deer calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and lose their spots by the end of summer. However, as in many species of Old World deer, some adults do retain a few spots on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> summer coats. The offspring will remain with their mothers for almost one full year, leaving around the time the next season's offspring are produced. The gestation period is the same for all subspecies.|$|E
2500|$|Koolies {{are much}} sought-after in rural Australia, and {{interest}} {{is now being}} shown in America, Canada, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland and Holland. According to Geoff Broughton, {{past president of the}} Koolie Club of Australia for 7 years, the Koolie will head (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), heel or drive, (push the stock from behind), cast (move out and around the stock), block (hold the stock or block them from in front, in three sheep trials this action is called the pick up) and back (literally jump onto <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> charges to herd them if necessary). Koolies have a reputation for being upright workers with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or gathering breakaways. They are not known for having [...] "sticky eyes" [...] (focusing on the sheep in front only). Unlike other working breeds, which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for either yard or field work, Koolies are at ease working in closed surroundings such as yards or trucks and being out in paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind they will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges.|$|E
2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E
