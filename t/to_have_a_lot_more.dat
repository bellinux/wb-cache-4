50|$|The city grew as {{the capital}} of the Buganda kingdom, from which several {{buildings}} survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Lubiri Palace, the Buganda Parliament and the Buganda Court of Justice. In 1890, British colonial administrator Frederick Lugard constructed a forum along Mengo Hill within the city, which allowed for the British to occupy much of the territory controlled by the Buganda, including Kampala. In 1894, the British government officially established a protectorate within this territory, and in 1896, the protectorate expanded to cover the Ankole, Toro Kingdom, and Bunyoro kingdoms as well. In 1905, the British government formally declared the entire territory to be a British colony. From that time until the independence of the country in 1962, the capital was relocated to Entebbe, although the city continued to be the primary economic and manufacturing location for Uganda. In 1922, the Makerere Technical Institute, now known as Makerere University, started as the first collegiate institution both within Kampala, and within the British colonies on the east coast of Africa. Following the 1962 independence, Milton Obote became president of Uganda, and held the position until 1971, when former sergeant Idi Amin defeated his government in a military coup. He proceeded to expel all Asian residents living within Kampala, and attacked the Jewish population living within the city. In 1978, he invaded the neighboring country of Tanzania, and in turn, the government there started the Uganda-Tanzania War, which created severe damage to the buildings of Kampala. Since then, the city has since then been rebuilt with constructions of new construction of hotels, banks, shopping malls, educational institutions, and hospitals and the improvement of war torn buildings and infrastructure. Traditionally, Kampala was a city of seven hills, but over time it has come <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{a typical}} BitTorrent swarm, a large {{proportion}} of the peers are behind firewalls or NATs. These peers are called unconnectable. When developing P 2 P applications, a main requirement is to handle unconnectable peers appropriately. One important aspect of this problem, which has not been emphasized so far, is understanding the difference between the attributes of unconnectable peers and peers in the open Internet. For example, if unconnectable peers spend much less time online, or if they download significantly more, exploiting these facts helps to optimize the implementation; and ignoring these facts can even lead to severe performance problems. Comparing open and unconnectable peers is not easy because most traces contain no information about connectability. Here we study two large traces collected in two private BitTorrent communities: FileList. org and BitSoup. org, both of which contain the connectability attribute. From these traces we extract several attributes of individual online sessions, swarms, and users. We compare the distributions of these attributes over unconnectable and open peers. We find that there are some potentially important differences, e. g., unconnectable users tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> sessions, and they tend to spend slightly more time online. Some of our findings are in contradiction with previous results that were based on a different trace collection methodology. I...|$|E
40|$|First of all, I {{just want}} to say that in my opinion this is an {{interesting}} and thought-provoking book, and a badly needed corrective to certain mistaken assumptions about James. I find myself very much in sympathy with many of its main points. Some of the things I have to say in the following may— or perhaps may not—be thought to disagree with some of what Professor Brown has argued in his book. If that is so, it should be taken only as an indication of the degree to which William James on Radical Empiricism and Religion stimulates philosophical thought. Similarly, the essay I found myself preparing for this occasion seems in the end <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> to do with what I think about James than, on the surface, it does with Professor Brown’s book: again, I would wish this to be seen as a compliment to the high quality of his work (which is certainly the way I see it), since everything I might have come up with here is in response to my reading of his book. One of Hunter Brown’s theses about William James ’ epistemology, especially as it found its expression in James ’ essay “The Will to Believe, ” is that—far from being an apologist for subjectivism or fideism—James was actually an exponent of his own brand of quite rigorous evidentialism. It is this claim that I primarily wish to examine in this essay. Here is, perhaps, one way of framing the issue that motivates “The Will to Believe. ” First, let u...|$|E
