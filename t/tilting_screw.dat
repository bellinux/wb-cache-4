40|$|The {{important}} structural {{characteristics of}} hexagonal GaN in an InGaN/GaN multi quantum well, which was aimed {{to make a}} light emitted diode and was grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on c-plain sapphire, are determined by using nondestructive high-resolution X-ray diffraction in detail. The distorted GaN layers were described as mosaic crystals characterized by vertical and lateral coherence lengths, a mean <b>tilt,</b> twist, <b>screw</b> and edge type threading dislocation densities. The rocking curves of symmetric (00. l) reflections {{were used to determine}} the tilt angle, while the twist angle was an extrapolated grown ω-scan for an asymmetric (hk. l) Bragg reflection with an h or k nonzero. Moreover, it is an important result that the mosaic structure was analyzed from a different (10. l) crystal direction that was the angular inclined plane to the z-axis. The mosaic structure parameters were obtained in an approximately defined ratio depending on the inclination or polar angle of the sample. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls {{sheathed}} {{with double}} layers of gypsum plasterboard {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the main connection method, screw connections between CFS and gypsum sheathing {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of screw connections with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant <b>screw</b> <b>tilting</b> and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture. However, the <b>screw</b> <b>tilting</b> and flexing fracture of the loaded sheathing edge gradually disappear at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer sheathing and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions. A unified design formula for the shear strength of screw connections with gypsum sheathing is proposed for ambient and elevated temperatures with adequate accuracy. A simplified load–displacement model with the post-peak branch is developed to evaluate the load–displacement response of screw connections with gypsum sheathing at ambient and elevated temperatures...|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} free {{energy in the}} system, dislocations can tend to {{concentrate}} themselves in certain zones, so that other regions will stay free of dislocations. This leads {{to the formation of}} 'dislocation walls', planes in a crystal where dislocations localise. Edge dislocations form so called <b>tilt</b> walls, while <b>screw</b> dislocations form twist walls. In both cases the increasing localisation of dislocations in the wall will increase the angle between the orientation of the crystal lattice {{on both sides of the}} wall. This leads to the formation of subgrains. The process is called subgrain rotation (SGR) and can eventually lead to the formation of new grains when the dislocation wall becomes a new grain boundary.|$|R
40|$|To prevent {{adjacent}} disc problems after spinal fusion, a {{pedicle screw}} with a mobile junction between {{the head and}} threaded shaft was newly developed. The threaded shaft of the screw has 10 degrees mobility in all directions, but its structure is to prevent abnormal translation and <b>tilting.</b> This <b>screw</b> was evaluated as follows: (1) endurance test: 106 times rotational stress was applied; (2) biological reactions: novel screws with a mobile head and conventional screws with a fixed head were inserted into the bilateral pedicles of the L 3, L 4, and L 5 in two mini pigs with combination. Eight months after surgery, vertebral units with the screw rod constructs were collected. After CT scan, the soft and bony tissues around the screws were examined grossly and histologically. As a result, none of the screws broke during the endurance test stressing. The mean amount of abrasion wear was 0. 0338 [*]g. In the resected mini pig section, though zygapophyseal joints between fixed-head screws showed bony union, the amount of callus in the zygapophyseal joints connected with mobile-head screws was small, and joint space was confirmed by CT. No metalloses were noted around any of the screws. Novel screws were suggested to be highly durable and histologically safe...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution x-ray diffraction, in surface symmetric, skew symmetric, {{and grazing}} {{incidence}} in-plane diffraction geometries, {{has been used}} to investigate the effect of an AlN interlayer between micron thick GaN and AlxGa 1 –xN layers grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy on basal plane sapphire. No change is found in the <b>tilt</b> mosaic (threading <b>screw</b> dislocation density) with thickness or Al fraction x of the upper layer. A linear increase in the twist mosaic (threading edge dislocation density) was observed as a function of interlayer thickness and x. For all samples the twist mosaic of the AlGaN was significantly greater, by at least a factor of two, than that of the GaN layer. With increasing interlayer thickness the in-plane lattice parameter of the AlGaN decreased. The results are explained in terms of extra threading edge dislocations resulting from relaxation at the GaN/AlN interface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a test program on screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures using steady state test method. The single shear screwed connections design {{rules in the}} current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures are not applicable to elevated temperature. A total of 102 single shear screwed connection specimens were tested at elevated temperatures. Three different thicknesses of thin sheet steels were considered in this study. The failure loads and failure modes {{were obtained from the}} tests. Several failure modes were observed including the bearing, <b>tilting</b> and bearing, <b>screw</b> shear, net section tension and material failure. The test strengths were compared with the predicted strengths using the current specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The predicted strengths were calculated using the reduced material properties obtained from tensile coupon tests at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the strengths of the single shear screwed connections predicted by the current specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{design rules}} of single shear screwed {{connections}} in the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures are based on investigation at ambient temperature. A total of 54 single shear screwed connection specimens were tested at three different load levels using transient state test method. Three thicknesses of sheet steels were used to fabricate the screwed connections. The critical temperature and the corresponding displacement of screwed connections {{were obtained from the}} transient state test curves. The test strengths obtained from the transient state tests are similar to those obtained from the steady state tests. The failure modes such as <b>tilting</b> and bearing, <b>screw</b> shear, bearing, and teat out failure were observed in the transient tests. It is found that the failure modes of the screwed connections tested at the lowest load level are generally consistent with those failure modes observed in the steady state tests, and the failure mode may change as the load level increases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to create a computationally efficient seismic analysis framework for cold-formed steel (CFS) framed-buildings supported by hysteretic nonlinear models for CFS members and screw-fastened connections. Design of CFS structures subjected to lateral seismic forces traditionally relies on the strength of subassemblies subjected to lateral loading of systems, such as strapped/sheathed shear walls and diaphragms, to provide adequate protection against collapse. Enabling performance-based seismic design of CFS buildings requires computationally efficient and accurate modeling tools that predict the nonlinear cyclic behavior of CFS buildings, the individual CFS components and connections. Such models should capture the energy dissipation and damage due to buckling and cross-sectional deformations in thin-walled CFS components subjected to cyclic loads such as those induced by earthquakes. Likewise, models for screw-fastened CFS connections should capture the energy dissipation and damage due to <b>tilting,</b> bearing, or <b>screw</b> shear when subjected to cyclic loading. In this dissertation, an analysis framework for CFS structures that captures the nonlinear cyclic behavior of critical components including axial members, flexural members, and scre...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccurate {{positioning}} of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the locking compression plate (LCP). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking screw holes and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the drill sleeve in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed. ResultsIt took an average 6. 6 seconds to insert the drill sleeve accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the <b>tilt</b> of the <b>screw</b> hole but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8. 8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5. 6 seconds). DiscussionTilted screw holes and combination-type holes affect the insertion of the drill sleeve into 3. 5 mm LCPs. Level of evidenceLevel IV, experimental study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: lateral growth arrest is {{recognised}} as {{the most}} common form of avascular necrosis (AVN) seen in the management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The purpose of this report is to present a new technique that is of benefit in the early identification and subsequent radiological monitoring of lateral growth arrest and which may permit appropriate timely surgical intervention. Methods: we performed a retrospective review of the medical records and serial radiographs of 11 patients (three males and eight females) with lateral growth disturbance in the proximal femoral physis. We devised a new technique (named the ‘Tilt angle’) for serial radiographic observation of lateral growth arrest. Results: this study included 11 hips in 11 patients. Ten patients had screw epiphyseodesis performed after progression of lateral growth arrest was noted. One patient did not have screw epiphyseodesis but the results for this patient are included, as they provide an interesting ‘control’ case for comparison. The average age of screw epiphyseodesis was 12 years. Seven patients demonstrated improvement in their <b>tilt</b> angle following <b>screw</b> epiphyseodesis (i. e. less valgus), one showed no change and two continued to decline. Conclusions: using a new technique to monitor the progression of lateral growth arrest, we noted that screw epiphyseodesis can be used for guided growth of the proximal femoral physis. This technique can be employed for serial radiographic observation of lateral growth arrest and can guide the clinician on the optimal timing of screw epiphyseodesis. Further studies are needed in order to clarify the optimal timing of screw epiphyseodesi...|$|R
