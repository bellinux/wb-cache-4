40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing forms, finding out the speaker’s intention, clarifying the politeness strategies, and identifying the reason of employing <b>threatening</b> acts. The data are <b>threatening</b> utterances that are taken from the action movie manuscripts entitled Air Force One, Hostage and Die Hard. In collecting the data, the writer uses observation method by selecting <b>threatening</b> acts, {{which can be found}} in those action movie manuscripts. To describe the form the writer refers to the grammatical form. In finding out the speaker’s intention the writer uses pragmatic analysis especially locution, illocution, and perlocution. In clarifying the politeness strategies the writer employs Brown and Levinson’s politeness strategies. In clarifying the reason, the writer uses SPEAKING Hymens theory. Having analyzed the data, the writer finds that the linguistic forms of <b>threatening</b> which are used in the action movie manuscripts are phrases and sentences. The types of phrase used in the <b>threatening</b> acts are noun phrase and prepositional phrase. While the types of sentences used in the <b>threatening</b> acts are declarative simple sentence, imperative simple sentence, declarative compound sentence, imperative compound sentence, negative imperative simple sentence, negative imperative compound sentence, imperative with let, declarative compound complex sentence and interrogative simple sentence. The speaker’s intention of using <b>threatening</b> acts are commanding and <b>threatening.</b> The politeness strategy of the speaker’s use on <b>threatening</b> acts are negative politeness strategies and bald on-record strategy. The reasons of the speaker using <b>threatening</b> acts are showing power, showing respects, and preference...|$|R

40|$|Approach-like {{actions are}} {{initiated}} faster with stimuli of positive valence. Conversely, avoidance-like actions are initiated faster with <b>threatening</b> stimuli of negative valence. We went beyond reaction time measures and investigated whether <b>threatening</b> stimuli also {{affect the way}} in which an action is carried out. Participants moved their hand either away from the picture of a spider (avoidance) or they moved their hand toward the picture of a spider (approach). We compared spider-fearful participants to non-anxious participants. When reaching away from the <b>threatening</b> spider picture, spider-fearful participants moved more directly to the target than controls. When reaching toward the <b>threatening</b> spider, spider-fearful participants moved less directly to the target than controls. Some conditions that showed clear differences in movement trajectories between spider-fearful and control participants were devoid of differences in reaction time. The deviation away from <b>threatening</b> stimuli provides evidence for the claim that affective states like fear leak into movement programming and produce deviations away from <b>threatening</b> stimuli in movement execution. Avoidance of <b>threatening</b> stimuli is rapidly integrated into ongoing motor behaviour in order to increase the distance between the participant's body and the <b>threatening</b> stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Threatening</b> health {{messages}} {{that focus on}} severity are popular, but frequently have no effect or even a counterproductive effect on behavior change. This paradox (i. e. wide application despite low effectiveness) may be partly explained by the intuitive appeal of <b>threatening</b> communication: {{it may be hard}} to predict the defensive reactions occurring in response to fear appeals. We examine this hypothesis by using two studies by Brown and colleagues, which provide evidence that <b>threatening</b> health messages in the form of distressing imagery in anti-smoking and anti-alcohol campaigns cause defensive reactions. Methods We simulated both Brown et al. experiments, asking participants to estimate the reactions of the original study subjects to the <b>threatening</b> health information (n = 93). Afterwards, we presented the actual original study outcomes. One week later, we assessed whether this knowledge of the actual study outcomes helped participants to more successfully estimate the effectiveness of the <b>threatening</b> health information (n = 72). Results Results showed that participants were initially convinced of the effectiveness of <b>threatening</b> health messages and were unable to anticipate the defensive reactions that in fact occurred. Furthermore, these estimates did not improve after participants had been explained the dynamics of <b>threatening</b> communication as well as what the effects of the <b>threatening</b> communication had been in reality. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the effectiveness of <b>threatening</b> health messages is intuitively appealing. What is more, providing empirical evidence against the use of <b>threatening</b> health messages has very little effect on this intuitive appeal. </p...|$|R

5|$|The list of <b>threatened</b> fauna of Michigan {{includes}} almost 400 endangered, <b>threatened</b> {{and special}} concern {{species that are}} located in Michigan {{as a part of}} the fauna of the United States. Endangered and <b>threatened</b> species in Michigan are protected through the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan, part of the 1994 Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. The list was last updated in 2009 to its sixth iteration. At this time, 69 new species were added, including many species of freshwater mussels and snails, and 13 species were removed. The state also recognizes species of special concern, which are not protected under the Act. These species have low or declining numbers in the state or a need for additional information on their populations in Michigan. If the species' numbers decline, they are moved to <b>threatened</b> or endangered status and afforded protection under the Act; if they increase, they are removed from the list without further action.|$|E

40|$|Low {{accessibility}} of <b>threatening</b> information {{is a crucial}} element {{in the theory of}} repression. Despite many attempts, no empirical evidence has been found for such an inverse memory bias in normal subjects. An alternative approach is to study repressive processes as an individual dierence. Adopting such a trait approach, several studies have shown impaired memory for <b>threatening</b> memories of real-life episodes in so-called repressors. Several other studies have yielded evidence of avoidant processing of mildly <b>threatening</b> information {{in the early stages of}} information processing in repressors. Thus far, little evidence for a similar avoidant bias in memory has been oered for repressors. To demonstrate the presence of memory deficits for mildly <b>threatening</b> information, we tested recall and cued recognition after a 30 min delay, for (i) <b>threatening,</b> (ii) pleasant, and (iii) neutral words in repressors and non-repressors. No proof was found for poorer recall and recognition of <b>threatening</b> words in repressors, or for lower numbers of <b>threatening</b> semantic intrusions in these individuals, while the power of the study was adequate. While repression-related avoidant processing may be present for even mildly <b>threatening</b> stimuli at earlier stages of information processing, the results of the present study indicate that repressed memory may only show up for relatively intense emotional events.
