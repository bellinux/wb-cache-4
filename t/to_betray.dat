5|$|In 544, Solomon {{was killed}} in battle, {{and over the next}} year the Byzantine {{position}} in Africa crumbled before the rebels. In late 545, Cutzinas and Iaudas joined Antalas in a march against Carthage, the capital and main stronghold of the Byzantine government in Africa. Cutzinas secretly agreed with the Byzantine governor, Areobindus, <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> Antalas, when battle was joined; Areobindus, however, revealed this to Guntharis, a Byzantine commander who was in turn in contact with Antalas and planned <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> Areobindus himself. To gain time to prepare, Guntharis advised Areobindus to take Cutzinas' children hostage; in the event Guntharis launched an uprising in Carthage which the thoroughly unwarlike Areobindus failed to suppress, resulting in his execution and the usurpation of the governorship by Guntharis. After his plans were revealed by Guntharis to Antalas, Cutzinas changed sides once more and allied himself with Guntharis, giving his mother and son as hostages. Along with the Armenian commander Artabanes, he was sent to pursue Antalas, scoring a victory over the rebel forces near Hadrumetum.|$|E

5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after that}} campaign, Simeon sought {{to punish the}} Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{stood near}} a window and, {{in the event}} of a {{problematic}} development, he would give a signal by waiving a white cloth, upon which the people gathered in the Plaza would force their way into the Cabildo. However, there were no problems and this emergency plan was not implemented. The historian Vicente Fidel López revealed that his father, Vicente López y Planes, who was present at the event, saw that Mariano Moreno was worried near the end in spite of the majority achieved. Moreno told Planes that the Cabildo was about <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> them.|$|E
60|$|Stormont {{pulled out}} his wallet, and then Thirlwell came near <b>to</b> <b>betraying</b> himself, because the {{dramatic}} surprise was almost too much for his self-control. Drummond snatched the bills from the other's hand and laughed, a savage, scornful laugh.|$|R

50|$|In Korea, pure blood theory {{had been}} a common belief. The debates on this topic can be found {{sporadic}} in the South, whereas the public opinion in the North is hard to access. In a nationalistic view, to impugn the theory would have been tantamount <b>to</b> <b>betraying</b> Koreanness {{in the face of}} the challenge of an alien ethnic nation.|$|R
5|$|The German Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret state police"), {{known as}} the Gestapo, was {{responsible}} for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured could expect to be interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. The Gestapo was effective at using informants within groups <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its place of production. 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E

5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wars}} in Gaul come to an end, Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds) is faced with both triumph and tribulation. On {{the heels of his}} victory comes news of his daughter's death. Awarded with the {{adulation}} of the people, he also garners the enmity of politicians in Rome, including Pompey the Great (Kenneth Cranham). In Rome, Pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> his former friend. Meanwhile, Caesar's niece Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) tries to steer her family on the dangerous path between the growing divisions of power.

6000|$|Fleda colored; she hesitated. [...] "Because he's too stupid!" [...] Save on {{one other}} occasion, {{at which we}} shall in time arrive, little as the reader may believe it, she never came nearer <b>to</b> <b>betraying</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Gereth {{that she was in}} love with Owen. She found a dim {{amusement}} in reflecting that if Mona had not been there and he had not been too stupid and he verily had asked her, she might, should she have wished to keep her secret, have found it possible to pass off the motive of her action as a mere passion for Poynton.|$|R
5|$|Souichi is the reincarnation of a {{mercenary}} named , {{who served}} as a bodyguard to Lady Aglaia in Pompeii but later betrayed her. He retains all of his memories of his life in Pompeii and encounters Reina and Shuna when he is fifteen.

5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|Baybars died in July 1277 and was {{succeeded by}} his sons who ruled {{in name only}} while Baybars' closest subordinate, Qalawun, acted as strongman. Qalawun usurped the throne in 1279 and soon after faced a {{rebellion}} by his viceroy in Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar, who was joined by Isa. The Ilkhanids and their Armenian and Georgian allies {{took advantage of the}} intra-Mamluk strife and an invitation by Sunqur to invade Syria, and sacked Aleppo. Isa reprimanded Sunqur for inciting the Muslims' enemies to attack and urged him not <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> Islam in his late age. Isa persuaded Sunqur not to join the Ilkhanids and the latter escaped Qalawun's advancing army. Isa also sought to evade Qalawun's troops and barricaded himself in the desert fortress of al-Rahba. He was replaced by his relative Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as punishment by Qalawun for supporting Sunqur's revolt. Muhammad's appointment was likely in name only, and in any case, Isa reconciled with Qalawun by 1280, when the sultan received him in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Following No Mercy, the storyline between JBL and The Undertaker ended. JBL {{was then}} {{placed in a}} new angle against Booker T. On an episode of SmackDown!, a six-man tag team match {{involving}} Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and René Duprée was scheduled. At the time, Booker T being a villain, congratulated JBL with the success that he has accomplished within the company in a segment backstage. The tag team match got underway, and JBL was {{led to believe that}} Booker was going <b>to</b> <b>betray</b> his tag partners, as Booker warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker pinning JBL for the win, thus turning Booker into a crowd favorite. The following week on SmackDown!, Booker defeated Orlando Jordan, JBL's associate, to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. At Survivor Series, JBL defeated Booker to retain the WWE title.|$|E
