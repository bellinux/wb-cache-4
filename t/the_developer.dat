5|$|Fallout 3 was {{initially}} under development by Black Isle Studios, a studio owned by Interplay Entertainment, under the working title Van Buren. Black Isle Studios was <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> {{of the original}} Fallout and Fallout 2. When Interplay Entertainment went bankrupt and closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, the license to develop Fallout 3 was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to Bethesda Softworks, a studio primarily known as <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> of The Elder Scrolls series. Bethesda's Fallout 3, however, was developed from scratch, using neither Van Buren code nor any other materials created by Black Isle Studios. In May 2007, a playable technology demo of the canceled project was released to the public.|$|E

5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, <b>the</b> <b>developer,</b> Blizzard Entertainment, expanded the gauntlet into a full-fledged, playable character. This period included a series of teasers from <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> and a campaign by actor Terry Crews to voice the character. Doomfist was ultimately voiced by Sahr Ngaujah. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} {{stems in}} large part from the interrelationship between VCCDD and <b>The</b> Villages <b>developers</b> (since VCCDD has no residents, the Board of Supervisors consists solely of individuals who work for or have an affiliation with <b>The</b> Villages <b>developers,</b> and VCCDDs infrastructure was purchased by the developers-controlled board from <b>the</b> <b>developers).</b> Essentially, <b>the</b> IRS position is that the VCCDD is an [...] "alter ego" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>developers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>developers</b> {{were focused}} on the idea they had for the game from the beginning. The visual style and {{gameplay}} were established early in the development, motivating <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> in how simply the development process progressed. In {{the first months of}} its development, <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> had created a tool chain and approximately 90% of the gameplay functionality. Two features of the game were unclear to <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> during development; a [...] "troop manipulation" [...] mechanic, a common feature found in other real-time strategy video games that allows players to control the movements of their units, was a feature that <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> wanted to include. They attempted to include it by allowing players to drag units backwards or stop them by clicking on them, but felt that such a feature took away from tactical decisions and put too much emphasis on micromanagement and twitch gameplay. <b>The</b> <b>developers</b> added menus to the main gameplay late in the game. The final version was described by them as a [...] "very polished version" [...] of the vision they had of what they wanted.|$|R
50|$|The audio of Swords & Soldiers {{was created}} as a {{collaboration}} between <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> and an external audio studio called Sonic Picnic, which was located near their offices, making it very accessible to them. <b>The</b> <b>developers</b> found Sonic Picnic to be helpful, receiving an audio experience from them that matched with their vision. Due to a low budget, <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> offered Sonic Picnic royalties, which Sonic Picnic accepted due to being impressed by <b>the</b> prototype. <b>Developers</b> stated that this process kept them motivated to finish the game. The voice samples for the characters and units were created by recording <b>the</b> various <b>developers</b> and putting their voices in the game.|$|R

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{north tower}} {{was scheduled to}} begin construction after summer 2008 and be completed in 2009. Originally, construction was supposed to commence in January 2008. Later, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> mentioned construction was going start in March, but the construction firm wasn't selected at that time. After March, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> said construction {{was going to start}} in May 2008. However, following the worldwide financial crisis of the late summer and fall of 2008, the project's developers announced that construction of the second tower was indefinitely on hold. With improving economic conditions in the city, construction started on this tower on October 2012; its first residents moved in August 2014. The north tower was later renamed The Harrison.|$|E

5|$|As {{a change}} from earlier games by <b>the</b> <b>developer,</b> Sabreman is invulnerable to enemies and is instead knocked back in a bounce by their touch. However, Sabreman will fall to his death if knocked off a precipice. The player begins with six lives and few extras can be found {{throughout}} the game. Blue gemstone power-ups turn Sabreman invincible to enemy touch for {{a limited amount of}} time. Enemies include harpies and gargoyles, who can be killed with Sabreman's weapon. Later in the game, eagles can pick up and drop Sabreman. Underwurlde has three possible endings, and each was designed to correspond to the plots of the three planned sequels in the Sabreman series. The player receives a score calculated by the number of objects acquired, enemies defeated, and percentage of rooms visited. The game also supports keyboard and joystick control, and as with other games from <b>the</b> <b>developer,</b> the instructions packaged with Underwurlde were cryptic, and left the player to figure out the controls and sequence on their own. The Commodore 64 version of the game is similar to the original in appearance and gameplay.|$|E
50|$|Game design {{decisions}} {{and lack of}} communication from <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> led to a massive community backlash in mid-2013, with commentators suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> were totally {{out of touch with}} the community and the needs of the game.|$|R

5|$|The Council wanted <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> to {{consider}} constructing a road tunnel from Mounts Bay Road to the underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around the tower, however <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> only agreed {{to consider}} building a pedestrian underpass beneath St Georges Terrace.|$|R
5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E

However, disputes arose between Arrington and <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> he had chosen for <b>the</b> Crunchpad. <b>The</b> <b>developers</b> broke off from Arrington and released the device on their own but it received few sales, and <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> later went bankrupt.|$|R
5|$|In October 1999 {{during an}} online {{question}} and answer session, John Carmack, while discussing that the original founders of id Software were unlikely to ever work together on a game again, mentioned that he was considering {{the idea of making}} a Commander Keen game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. Activision formally announced at the start of May 2001 that a new Commander Keen game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released {{at the end of the}} month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> for the project as they had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games. While Palmer was <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> for the game, id collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} {{the following month}} that <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> was planning to create the game for Sony's PlayStation 2, perhaps {{to coincide with the}} console's release. Ultimately, however, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> became involved with Sega's Dreamcast through Visual Concepts—a Sega developer in charge of third-party game development. Johnson and Voorsanger began development of the third game with the intention to re-make ToeJam & Earl; according to Johnson, the game would include the same elements as the first game, but with improved graphics. However, this notion was curtailed by Visual Concepts, who felt that the result would be too old-fashioned, and too niche in appeal. Johnson later said that he was unsure, at the time, whether to cater to fans who wanted a remake of the original or attempt to capture a new audience.|$|E

50|$|The game's {{name comes}} from the title of an {{internal}} production blog, which became popular with <b>the</b> <b>developers.</b> <b>The</b> team was inspired by Team Fortress, Street Fighter II, and League of Legends. The company was approached at PAX Prime by Sony representatives who played the game for 20 minutes, watched others play the game, and eventually introduced themselves to ask <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> to consider bringing the game to PlayStation 4. When <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> responded {{that they did not}} have the money, the representatives offered development kits and asked how they could reduce the company's barriers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea came}} out from a game jam. <b>The</b> <b>developers</b> had reached out to Nintendo through its indie self-publishing program.

The hosts of Game Grumps became {{involved}} in the project at a suggestion to <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> by [...] "superfan" [...] Vitas Varnas who provided them with their contact info.
