5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after its founding, the Khitan Empire began {{a process of}} territorial expansion, with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae.
