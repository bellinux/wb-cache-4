He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store. He occasionally spent time at a local airport in Bedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in flying. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights for a $1 fee and taught him the basics of flying.|$|E

5|$|The 6S {{units were}} {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the evening.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active during <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> late afternoon, with the hottest {{hours of the}} day being spent in rest. These extremely agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
5|$|The medley relay was {{scheduled}} for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of swimming competition, with heats in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> final in the evening. Australia's prospects improved when Sweden was disqualified in the first heat. Australia and the Soviet Union swam in the second heat. With their superior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice quartet in the heats. On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest KerryGlenn Patching swam the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over {{each of the first}} three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians still qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets were more than 1.5s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case, despite resting all of their first-choice quartet, the home team were still faster than the Australians, who had fielded all but one of their full-strength team.|$|E

5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E

25|$|For Roman Catholics, fasting, {{taken as}} a {{technical}} term, is the reduction of one's intake of food to one full meal (which may not contain meat on Ash Wednesday and Fridays throughout Lent) and two small meals (known liturgically as collations, taken in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evening), both of which together should not equal the large meal. Eating solid food between meals is not permitted. Fasting is required of the faithful {{between the ages of}} 18 and 59 on specified days. Complete abstinence of meat for the day is required of those 14 and older. Partial abstinence prescribes that meat be taken only once {{during the course of the}} day. Meat is understood not to include fish or cold-blooded animals.|$|E
25|$|Most {{meteorological}} data was acquired {{all at once}} early in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; {{as well as on}} visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted weather maps were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as weather watches and warnings, surface weather conditions, convective outlooks, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.|$|E
