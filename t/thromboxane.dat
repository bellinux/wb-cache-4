5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of <b>thromboxane</b> A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum <b>thromboxane</b> A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to <b>thromboxane</b> levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, <b>thromboxane</b> A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E

25|$|Cyclooxygenases are {{enzymes that}} {{take part in}} a complex biosynthetic cascade that results in the {{conversion}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids to prostaglandins and <b>thromboxane(s).</b>|$|R
25|$|Prostaglandins {{have two}} derivatives: prostacyclins and <b>thromboxanes.</b> Prostacyclins are {{powerful}} locally acting vasodilators and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Through {{their role in}} vasodilation, prostacyclins are also involved in inflammation. They are synthesized in the walls of blood vessels and serve the physiological function of preventing needless clot formation, as well as regulating the contraction of smooth muscle tissue. Conversely, <b>thromboxanes</b> (produced by platelet cells) are vasoconstrictors and facilitate platelet aggregation. Their name comes from their role in clot formation (thrombosis).|$|R
25|$|An {{intermediate}} {{arachidonic acid}} is created from diacylglycerol via phospholipase-A2, then brought {{to either the}} cyclooxygenase pathway or the lipoxygenase pathway. The cyclooxygenase pathway produces <b>thromboxane,</b> prostacyclin and prostaglandin D, E and F. Alternatively, the lipoxygenase enzyme pathway is active in leukocytes and in macrophages and synthesizes leukotrienes.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{necessary}} for normal sperm development. It activates genes in Sertoli cells, which promote differentiation of spermatogonia. It regulates acute HPA (Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis) response under dominance challenge. Androgen including testosterone enhances muscle growth. Testosterone also regulates the population of <b>thromboxane</b> A2 receptors on megakaryocytes and platelets and hence platelet aggregation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{encoding}} CYP enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, {{are designated}} with the root symbol CYP for the superfamily, {{followed by a}} number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene. The convention is to italicise the name when referring to the gene. For example, CYP2E1 is the gene that encodes the enzyme CYP2E1—one of the enzymes involved in paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism. The CYP nomenclature is the official naming convention, although occasionally CYP450 or CYP450 is used synonymously. However, some gene or enzyme names for CYPs may differ from this nomenclature, denoting the catalytic activity {{and the name of}} the compound used as substrate. Examples include CYP5A1, <b>thromboxane</b> A2 synthase, abbreviated to TBXAS1 (<b>ThromBoXane</b> A2 Synthase 1), and CYP51A1, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, sometimes unofficially abbreviated to LDM according to its substrate (Lanosterol) and activity (DeMethylation).|$|E

25|$|Cyclooxygenases {{have two}} main isoforms that are called COX-1 and COX-2 (as {{well as a}} COX-3). COX-1 is {{responsible}} for the synthesis of prostaglandin and <b>thromboxane</b> in many types of cells, including the gastro-intestinal tract and blood platelets. COX-2 {{plays a major role in}} prostaglandin biosynthesis in inflammatory cells and in the central nervous system. Prostaglandin synthesis in these sites is a key factor in the development of inflammation and hyperalgesia.|$|E
25|$|This {{antiplatelet}} property makes aspirin {{useful for}} reducing the incidence of heart attacks; heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots, and their reduction {{with the introduction of}} small amounts of aspirin has been seen to be an effective medical intervention.

25|$|The {{bacterial}} variant Clostridium perfringens type A produces alpha-toxin. The toxin has phospholipase C activity, {{and causes}} hemolysis, lethality, and dermonecrosis. At high concentrations, alpha-toxin induces massive degradation of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, producing diacylglycerol and ceramide, respectively. These molecules then participate in signal transduction pathways. It {{has been reported}} that the toxin activates the arachidonic acid cascade in isolated rat aorta. The toxin-induced contraction was related to generation of <b>thromboxane</b> A2 from arachidonic acid. Thus it is likely the bacterial PLC mimics the actions of endogenous PLC in eukaryotic cell membranes.|$|E

25|$|PGH2 has a 5-carbon ring bridged by {{molecular}} oxygen. Its derived PGS {{have lost}} this oxygen bridge and contain a single, unsaturated 5-carbon ring {{with the exception}} of <b>thromboxane</b> A2 which possesses a 6-member ring consisting of one oxygen and 5 carbon atoms. The 5-carbon ring of prostacyclin is conjoined to a second ring consisting of 4 carbon and one oxygen atom. And, the 5 member ring of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins possesses an unsaturated bond in a conjugated system with a carbonyl group that causes these PGs to form bonds with a diverse range of bioactive proteins (for more see the diagrams at Prostanoid).|$|E
25|$|However, several COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitors have subsequently been withdrawn after evidence {{emerged that}} COX-2 inhibitors {{increase the risk}} of heart attack (e.g., see the article on Vioxx). The underlying mechanism for the deleterious effect proposes that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body express COX-2, whose selective inhibition results in levels of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, prostacyclin) down-regulated relative to <b>thromboxane</b> (since COX-1 in platelets is unaffected). Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGI2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. As platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference between aspirin and the reversible inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandin is a {{large family}} of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play {{important}} roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, {{so there is no}} reason to believe that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And {{there is no reason to}} believe that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and <b>thromboxane</b> is the determinant factor for vascular tone. Indeed, Merck has stated that there was no effect on prostacyclin production in blood vessels in animal testing. Corey speculated that the cardiotoxicity may be associated with an organic acid anhydride formed when rofecoxib is exposed to air.|$|E

25|$|Prostaglandins {{are local}} hormones (paracrine) {{produced}} {{in the body and}} have diverse effects in the body, including but not limited to transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. <b>Thromboxanes</b> are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots.|$|R
25|$|Closure of the {{umbilical}} artery by vasoconstriction consists of multiple constrictions which increase {{in number and}} degree with time. There are segments of dilatations with trapped uncoagulated blood between the constrictions before complete occlusion. Both the partial constrictions and the ultimate closure are mainly produced by muscle cells of the outer circular layer. In contrast, the inner layer seems to serve mainly as a plastic tissue which can easily be shifted in an axial direction and then folded into the narrowing lumen to complete the closure. The vasoconstrictive occlusion appears to be mainly mediated by serotonin and <b>thromboxane</b> A2. The artery in cords of preterm infants contracts more to angiotensin II and arachidonic acid and is more sensitive to oxytocin than in term ones. In contrast to the contribution of Wharton's jelly, cooling causes only temporary vasoconstriction.|$|E
25|$|Both COX1 and COX2 (also termed prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-1 (PTGS1) and PTGS2, respectively) metabolize {{arachidonic acid}} by adding {{molecular}} O2 between carbons 9 and 11 {{to form an}} endoperoxide bridge between these two carbons, adding molecular O2 to carbon 15 to yield a 15-hydroperoxy product, creating a carbon-carbon bond between carbons 8 and 12 to create a cyclopentane ring {{in the middle of}} the fatty acid, and in the process making PGG2, a product that has two fewer double bonds than arachidonic acid. The 15-hydrpperoxy residue of PGG2 is then reduced to a 15-hydroxyl residue thereby forming PGH2. PGH2 is the parent prostanoid to all other postanoids. It is metabolized by (see diagram in Prostanoids: a) the Prostaglandin E synthase pathway in which any one of three isozymes, PTGES, PTGES2, or PTGES3, convert PGH2 to PGE2 (subsequent products of this pathway include PGA2 and PGB2 (see Prostanoid#Biosynthesis); b) PGF synthase which converts PGH2 to PGF2α; c) Prostaglandin D2 synthase which converts PGH2 to PGD2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 15-dPGJ2 (see Cyclopentenone prostaglandin); d) <b>thromboxane</b> synthase which converts PGH2 to TXA2 (subsequent products in this pathway include TXB2); and e) Prostacyclin synthase which converts PGH2 to PGI2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 6-keto-PGFα. These pathways have been shown or in some cases presumed to metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoid analogs of the sited products that have three rather than two double bonds and therefore contain the number 3 in place of 2 attached to their names (e.g. PGE3 instead of PGE2).|$|E
500|$|Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis and complications during pregnancy, often leading to fetal death. [...] It {{is caused by}} the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). The anti-β2GPI antibodies are most prevalent in causing the symptoms of the disease. When bound by an antibody, β2GPI begins to interact with monocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets. ApoER2 is thought to {{play a key role in}} the process of platelet binding. β2GPI has the proper binding site for interaction with ApoER2 and other LDL family receptors, and it is speculated that the antibody/β2GPI complexes interact with ApoER2 on platelets. [...] This causes the phosphorylation of a p38MAPkinase, resulting in the production of <b>thromboxane</b> A2. <b>Thromboxane</b> A2 functions to activate more platelets, and this leads to a greater chance for blood clots to form. There is also speculation that the antibody/β2GPI complexes sensitize other cell types through various LDL family receptors to lead to less common symptoms other than thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, British {{pharmacologist}} John Robert Vane, then {{employed by}} the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and <b>thromboxanes.</b> For this discovery {{he was awarded the}} 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, jointly with Sune Bergström and Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson.|$|R
50|$|Most NSAIDs {{inhibit the}} {{activity}} of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and thereby the synthesis of prostaglandins and <b>thromboxanes.</b> It is thought that inhibiting COX-2 leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects and that those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX-1, particularly aspirin, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.|$|R
