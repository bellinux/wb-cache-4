5|$|As the {{electric}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> expanded, {{allowing for the}} more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E

25|$|The Grove cell {{was invented}} by Welshman William Robert Grove in 1839. It {{consisted}} of a zinc anode dipped in sulfuric acid and a platinum cathode dipped in nitric acid, separated by porous earthenware. The Grove cell provided a high current and nearly twice the voltage of the Daniell cell, which made it the favoured cell of the American <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> for a time. However, it gave off poisonous nitric oxide fumes when operated. The voltage also dropped sharply as the charge diminished, which became a liability as <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> grew more complex. Platinum was also very expensive.|$|R
25|$|Four {{telecommunication}} companies provide {{local and}} international direct distance dialing and fax services. Inter island communications is available through the government's <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> and the Provincial Radio Communication System. In addition, there are 19 post offices, a number of cargo forwarders provide air parcel and freight services.|$|E
25|$|The {{facilities}} of {{the shipyard}} itself were also expanded in this period. In 1881, Roach added {{a number of}} hydraulic and pneumatic riveting machines to the yard—amongst the first such machines in the country. In the same year, he installed a private <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> to accelerate communications between his various plants, and he also installed an Edison electric lighting system at the yard which allowed longer working hours in winter and a second shift when required.|$|E
25|$|A train {{passed through}} Getå at 6:26 p.m. without any problems. The {{first sign of}} trouble came when the station guard on duty at Getå Halt heard the {{telephone}} wires vibrating between 6:33 and 6:40. At around 6:50 p.m., a milk cart went by the site; no collapse was noticed. Between 6:52 and 6:55 the clay stratum under the embankment gave way and collapsed. At approximately 6:55, the <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> that ran along the railway line came down.|$|E

25|$|A {{solar flare}} is a {{phenomenon}} where the sun suddenly releases {{a great amount of}} solar radiation, much more than normal. Solar flares are unlikely to cause any direct injury, but can destroy electrical equipment. The potential of solar storms to cause disaster was seen during the 1859 Carrington event, which disrupted the <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> and the March 1989 geomagnetic storm which blacked out Quebec. Some major known solar flares include the X20 event on August 16, 1989, and a similar flare on April 2, 2001. The most powerful flare ever recorded occurred on November 4, 2003 (estimated at between X40 and X45).|$|E
25|$|To keep up morale, Gordon had a {{military}} band perform concerts {{in the central}} plaza every Friday and Sunday evenings for free, and cast his own decorations for his men. Though the telegraph lines to Cairo were cut, Gordon used the remaining telegraph lines to build his own <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> within Khartoum linking the men holding the walls of Khartoum to Governor-General's palace, thus keeping him well informed of what was happening. To slow down the Ansar assaults, Gordon built primitive landmines out of water cans stuffed with dynamite and to confuse the enemy about his numbers, he put up wooden dummies in uniform along the walls of Khartoum facing the Blue Nile.|$|E
25|$|By 1855 {{there was}} {{speculation}} about possible routes for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line to connect Australia {{to the new}} telegraph cable in Java and then Europe. There was fierce competition between the colonies over the route with governments recognising the economic benefits that would result from becoming {{the centre of the}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> A number of routes were considered including Ceylon to Albany in Western Australia, or Java to the north coast of Australia and then either onto east coast, or south through the centre of the continent to Adelaide. The Victorian government organised the Burke and Wills expedition to cross the continent in 1860. The South Australian government offered a reward of £2000 to encourage an expedition to find a route between South Australia and the north coast.|$|E
50|$|Government-operated {{post office}} and <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> - the largest parts of the {{bureaucracy}} - were combined into a single department in each colony {{on the model of}} the UK Post Office: South Australia in 1869, Victoria in 1870, Queensland in 1880 and New South Wales in 1893.|$|R

50|$|Later {{telephones}} {{took advantage}} of the exchange principle already employed in <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks.</b> Each telephone was wired to a telephone exchange established for a town or area. For communications outside this exchange area, trunks were installed between exchanges. Networks were designed in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents and oceans.|$|R
500|$|The use {{of weather}} charts {{in a modern}} sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. The {{development}} of a <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> by 1845 {{made it possible to}} gather weather information from multiple distant locations quickly enough to preserve its value for real-time applications. The Smithsonian Institution developed its network of observers over much of the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s. [...] The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The {{force was}} divided into various divisions, each {{typically}} commanded by a superintendent. The headquarters of the force was initially sited at Lower Fort Garry, until the March West to Fort Walsh, but in 1888 it was moved to Regina, {{to be closer to}} the new railway line. The Regina headquarters became known locally as [...] "the Barracks", and during the 1890s typically held around 200 police at any one time. Many of the force's posts were linked by the <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> and, from 1885 onwards, by telephones, with the communications encrypted when necessary using Slater's Telegraphic Code. Typewriters were acquired in 1886, and a printing press for disseminating orders in 1888. The force did not have its own prison – those sentenced to prison terms would be sent to the Manitoba Penitentiary – and until 1891 the only short-term jail facilities in the territories were the guardrooms of the force's various divisional headquarters.|$|E

50|$|As {{telephone}} and <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> were disrupted by flood damage, amateur radio operators {{went into the}} affected areas with their equipment to form a voluntary emergency radio network. These radio amateurs provided radio communications for 10 days and nights, and {{were the only people}} able to maintain contact from affected areas with the outside world.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} telegraph, or {{more commonly}} just telegraph, superseded optical semaphore telegraph systems, thus {{becoming the first}} form of electrical telecommunications. In a matter of decades after their creation in the 1830s, electrical <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.|$|R

[...] Wells gives numerous examples of productivity increases in various industries and discusses the problems of excess capacity and market saturation.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{engineering}} {{became a}} profession {{in the later}} 19th century. [...] Practitioners had created a global electric <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline. [...] Although {{it is impossible to}} precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. W. B. O'Shaughnessy, a Professor of Chemistry in the Calcutta Medical College, {{received}} permission in 1851 {{to conduct}} a trial run for a telegraph service from Calcutta to Diamond Harbour along the river Hooghly. Four telegraph offices, mainly for shipping-related business, were also opened along the river that year. [...] The telegraph receiver used in the trial was a galvanoscope of Dr. O'Shaughnessy's design and manufactured in India. [...] When the experiment was deemed {{to be a success}} a year later, the Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie, sought permission from the Court of Directors of the Company for the construction of telegraph lines from [...] "Calcutta to Agra, Agra to Bombay, Agra to Peshawar, and Bombay to Madras, extending in all over 3,050 miles and including forty-one offices." [...] The permission was soon granted; by February 1855 all the proposed telegraph lines had been constructed and were being used to send paid messages. Dr. O'Shaughnessy's instrument was used all over India until early 1857, when it was supplanted by the Morse instrument. [...] By 1857, the <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> had expanded to 4,555 miles of lines and sixty two offices, and had reached as far as the hill station of Ootacamund in the Nilgiri Hills and the port of Calicut on the southwest coast of India. [...] During the Indian rebellion of 1857, more than seven hundred miles of telegraph lines were destroyed by the rebel forces, mainly in the North-Western Provinces. [...] The East India Company was nevertheless able to use the remaining intact lines to warn many outposts of impending disturbances. [...] The political value of the new technology was, thus, driven home to the Company, and, in the following year, not only were the destroyed lines rebuil, but the network was expanded further by 2,000 miles.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} the {{networks}} meant that regulation in Australia was undemanding: network personnel were government employees or agents, legislation was enhanced on an incremental basis and restrictions could be achieved through infrastructure. All the colonies ran their <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> at a deficit through investment in infrastructure and subsidisation of regional access, generally with bipartisan support.|$|R
