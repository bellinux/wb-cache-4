5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E

5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{fertility}} among second-generation migrant women across Europe have mainly {{treated the}} second generation as a rather homogenous group, not linking and distinguishing fertility patterns by type of partner. This study investigates how {{and to what extent}} the origin and generation of the partner (endogamous or exogamous as well as diversity in endogamy) of Turkish and Moroccan second-generation women in Belgium is related to first-birth rates. We distinguish three types of partnerships: <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> endogamous union with <b>a</b> first-generation partner, <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> endogamous union with a second-generation partner, and <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> exogenous union where the partner is of native Belgian origin. We use linked Census-Register data for the period 2001 – 2006. Applying event history models, our findings reveal clear differences between the endogamous and exogamous unions with respect to the timing of first births. Second-generation women of both origin groups have the lowest parenthood rates when the partner is of native Belgian origin. However, no variation is found within endogamous unions. For endogamous unions with a first-generation partner, the parenthood rates are approximately the same (and not higher, as was expected) compared to when the partner is also of second generation. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as hypoxia. Oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer, increasing {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> normal oxygen environment.|$|E
25|$|The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised full {{same-sex}} marriage in England and Wales starting from March 2014, although civil partnership also remains available.

25|$|Some {{marine organisms}} bear {{more than one}} lens; for {{instance}} the copepod Pontella has three. The outer has a parabolic surface, countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed. Another copepod, Copilia, has two lenses in each eye, arranged like <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> telescope. Such arrangements are rare and poorly understood, but represent an alternative construction. Multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders, which have a refractive cornea (discussed next): these have a negative lens, enlarging the observed image by up to 50% over the receptor cells, thus increasing their optical resolution.|$|E

25|$|Folk {{models of}} belief, lack of education, and {{religious}} connotations {{of the disease}} continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted {{in many parts of}} the world.

Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent.

25|$|The {{differentiation}} between two accents present in monophthongs and complex diphthongs is clearest in the Samogitian dialect. It is less so in western Aukštaitian and more assimilated {{in the eastern}} and southern Aukštaitian dialects. In the standard language, accents in monophthongs differ with longer circumflex vowels both in diapason (tonal grouping) and intensity. In practice, however, these distinctions are minor. Similarly, in complex diphthongs (ie and uo), and mixed diphthongs beginning with i and u, the first element of these diphthongs does not lengthen when stressed. On the other hand, simple and mixed diphthongs starting in a and e are clearly differentiated in the standard language. The {{first part of the}} diphthong becomes longer and more tense under the acute accent. In eastern and southern Aukštaitian, diphthongs starting in i and u lengthen similarly to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> and e, and thus the accents can be easily differentiated.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of the FMA {{have claimed}} that life for <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{heterosexual}} marriage are not materially affected by a constitutional marriage definition or legalization of same-sex marriage. They stated that the FMA was totally unnecessary because federal and state laws, combined {{with the state of}} the relevant constitutional doctrines at the time, already made court-ordered nationwide same-sex marriage unlikely for the foreseeable future. It was claimed therefore, that such an amendment was a solution in search of a problem. It was claimed that neither federal nor state courts were likely to order same-sex marriage under the traditional interpretation of the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause. Nor, for the foreseeable future, it was claimed, were courts likely to mandate same-sex marriage under substantive federal constitutional doctrines, such as the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. However, in light of the legalisation of same-sex marriage in several states since 2012, this claim is no longer true.|$|E
