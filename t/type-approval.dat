5000|$|A {{main source}} of {{ambiguity}} and differences comes from the conditions the test was done at. These conditions include details like atmospheric conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity), tire pressure, but most importantly: {{the conditions of the}} motorcycle itself. Examples thereof are: was the alternator fitted?; was the air filter fitted?; what exhaust system was fitted? One would hope that manufacturers would test their motorcycles in normal running order, so the condition that they are sold in, and for which they obtained <b>type-approval,</b> but this is not always the case. Ducati, for instance, has chosen to publish more positive values, stating that [...] "Technical data referring to power and torque was measured on an engine test stand at Ducati". Their published values are typically 5% higher than the homologation values, in normal running order.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{crankshaft}} power excludes these transmission losses, {{still the}} measurement is often made {{elsewhere in the}} drive-train, often at the rear wheel.

In directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the <b>type-approval</b> of two or three-wheel motor vehicles, it {{is referred to as}} [...] "maximum engine power", and manufacturers use similar terms. Historically, this convention may have come from the pre-unit construction, wherein the crankshaft was directly accessible for measurements, and the gearbox might have come from a different manufacturer. However, when the engineering details of the transmission are known, the losses therein can be accurately quantified & corrected for. Explicit guidance on the homologation measurements and transmission corrections is given in directive 95/1/EC.|$|E

50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different con rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European <b>type-approval</b> for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|E

Comparison of this dataset with the Travelcard database in the Netherlands showed that the deviation increased for late model years and in particular for cars with low <b>type-approval</b> values. The deviation was higher than 60 % for vehicles registered in 2012 within the 90 - 100 gCO 2 /km bin.

This may be either used to correct fuel consumption factors currently utilized by emission models (e. g.

40|$|AbstractThe {{emissions}} of CO 2 and regulated pollutants (NOx, HC, CO, PM) of thirteen Euro 5 compliant passenger cars (seven gasoline, six Diesel) were {{measured on a}} chassis dynamometer. The vehicles were driven repeatedly over the European <b>type-approval</b> driving cycle (NEDC) and the more dynamic WMTC and CADC driving cycles. Distance-specific emission factors were derived for each pollutant and sub-cycle, and these were subsequently compared to the corresponding emission factors provided by the reference European models used for vehicle emission inventory compilation (COPERT and HBEFA) and put in context with the applicable European emission limits. The measured emissions stayed below the legal emission limits when the <b>type-approval</b> cycle (NEDC) was used.

40|$|For clarity, in the {{following}} article pedelec means a bicycle with a motor that only functions on condition the cyclist pedals, whilst e-bike means a bicycle with a motor that functions by turning the throttle, so irrespective of the cyclist pedalling. The term electric bicycle is generic and includes pedelecs, e-bikes and combinations of these types. All electric bicycles, except pedelecs up to 25 km/h and a maximum continuous rated motor output of 250 W, are subject to <b>type-approval.</b> The <b>type-approval</b> rules have been laid down in Regulation 168 / 2013. Electric bikes are classified in vehicle category L 1 e, which is subdivided in L 1 e-A for “powered cycles” and L 1 e-B for “mopeds”. The type approval rules come into force on January 1, 2017. L 1 e-A “powered cycles” are defined as cycles designed to pedal, equipped with an auxiliary propulsion with the primary aim to aid pedalling. The propulsion should be limited at a speed of 25 km/h and its maximum continuous rated power should not exceed 1000 W. L 1 e-A includes two-, three- and four-wheel vehicles, i. e. also electric cargo bikes with more than two wheels. L 1 e-B “mopeds” are defined as vehicles with a maximum design speed of more than 25 km/h and up to 45 km/h and a maximum continuous rated power of in between 1000 W and 4000 W. As {{a result of this}} categorisation, a pedelec 25 km/h with 750 W for instance will come under L 1 e-A, an e-bike 25 km/h with 500 W as well, whilst a pedelec 45 km/h with 1000 W will come under L 1 e-B. A vehicle that combines pedal assistance with open throttle will come under L 1 e-A. Technically, this legislation, does not allow for e-bikes above 25 km/h. As for pedelecs 45 km/h, the regulations contain further technical specifications: “(…) mass in running order ? 35 kg and shall be fitted with pedals enabling the vehicle to be propelled solely by the rider’s muscular leg power. The vehicle shall feature adjustable rider positioning in order to enhance the ergonomic posture of the rider for pedalling. The auxiliary propulsion power shall be added to the driver’s pedal power and shall be {{less than or equal to}} four times the actual pedal power. ” Furthermore, “the maximum peak power shall be < 1, 6 X maximum continuous rated power, measured as mechanical power at the shaft of the motor unit. ” Former trade association ETRA opposed the introduction of factor four in the above definition. The trade association argued that there was no scientific evidence to support the concept that this factor is necessary to guarantee the safety of the vehicles. Furthermore, the introduction of such a factor made it technically impossible for e-bikes to comply with <b>type-approval.</b> Therefore, they would be completely excluded from the market. ETRA also argued that the factor discriminates those riders who are not capable to put much power in the pedals themselves. Eventually, the Commission and ETRA reached an agreement. Factor four was left in the definition but {{the following}} preamble was added to the Regulation: “The limitation to ‘four’ of the ratio of auxiliary propulsion power and actual pedal power for cycles designed to pedal set out in Annex XIX should be subject to further scientific research and assessment. Upon availability of scientific data and statistics on vehicles placed on the market, the ratio ‘four’ referred to above may be revisited in a future revision of this Regulation. ” The e-bike problem was solved by an agreement that, provided their speed is limited to 25 km/h, they may be type-approved as L 1 e-A vehicles. The <b>type-approval</b> legislation is made up of the framework Regulation 168 / 2013, which lays down the basis of the <b>type-approval.</b> The competence for this law was with the European Parliament and Council. All technical and administrative details however were in the hands of the European Commission, who laid these down in 4 Regulations: • Delegated Regulation on functional safety • Delegated Regulation on vehicle construction • Delegated Regulation on environmental and propulsion unit performance • Implementing Regulation on administrative provisions In the old system, all legal texts had to go through Parliament and Council, which made it a complicated and very time-consuming procedure. In the new procedure, Parliament and Council have only treated the basic text, whereas technical and administrative details are dealt with by the Commission. As a result, those details can be easily and quickly amended and corrected if necessary and/or adapted to technical progress. Originally, the draft legal texts were written exclusively in view of type-approving conventional mopeds and motorcycles. Yet, the scope of the <b>type-approval</b> also included most electric bicycles. It was the former dealer association, ETRA, that first drew the European institutions’ attention to the fact that technical requirements for mopeds and motorcycles are not necessarily best suited for electric bicycles. Eventually, the European Commission accepted to work together with the electric bicycle business to adapt the <b>type-approval</b> requirements to electric bicycles. At a later stage COLIBI/COLIPED also joined in the consultations and the final result was a <b>type-approval</b> system that is adapted to electric bicycles to a certain degree. The system is not perfect yet, so in the next couple of years, further updating and improving will be required. The list of components and characteristics subject to <b>type-approval</b> is in the framework Regulation 168 / 2013. The technical requirements and tests to which those components and characteristics have to comply are laid down in the three abovementioned delegated Regulations. Electric bicycles are excluded from <b>type-approval</b> for some components and characteristics, whereas for others specific requirements have been introduced. The tables in this document gives an overview of the relevant components and characteristics and the corresponding requirements. Those that do not feature in the table are excluded from electric bike <b>type-approval.</b> (Author/publisher...|$|E

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} of new passenger cars (PCs) registered in Europe are monitored {{in order to}} meet the objectives of Regulation EC 443 / 2009. This calls for an average CO 2 emission of 130 g/km for new PCs registered in Europe to be met by vehicle measures in 2015. This decreases to 95 g/km in 2020. Similar regulations are gradually promoted for other vehicle categories as well, more prominently for light commercial vehicles (LCVs). CO 2 {{emissions of}} new vehicle types are determined during the vehicle <b>type-approval</b> by testing over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Worries have been expressed that this driving cycle is not representative of real-world driving conditions. It is considered that fuel consumption, and hence CO 2 emissions (and air pollutant emissions), measured over this cycle under-represent reality. This report uses real-world information to compare in-use fuel consumption of PCs with <b>type-approval</b> CO 2.
