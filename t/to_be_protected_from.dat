5|$|There {{are areas}} which people believe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>{{protected}}</b> <b>from</b> tornadoes, whether {{by being in}} a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes {{have been known to}} cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E

5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 {{percent of the land}} in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author has the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

25|$|Cuba {{perceived}} the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions {{on how to}} resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as {{the status of the}} US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come. On the other hand, Cuba continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> invasion.|$|E

25|$|Norwegian ships {{continued}} to use the Danish civil ensign distinguished with the national arms in the canton north of Cape Finisterre, but had to fly the Swedish civil ensign in the Mediterranean <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> pirate attacks.

25|$|An interdict was {{obtained}} to prevent newspapers in South Africa from publishing the cartoons. Independent Newspapers (South Africa) did however publish an article which Muslims alleged was blasphemous {{and for this}} reason protest marches were arranged. President Thabo Mbeki reacted to the granting of the interdict by saying that the courts had spoken and that anyone who had objections to the granting of the interdict could pursue the matter as allowed by the law. He {{went on to say that}} the courts had the obligation to balance rights of citizens to freedom of speech to those of others <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> harm or insult.

25|$|Identified {{victims of}} child {{trafficking}} {{are entitled to}} special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law.

An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.|$|E
25|$|The {{associated}} problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, {{there would}} be increased pressure on the remaining two, and {{if one of them}} popped out the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to Galileo revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun any closer than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> that extra heat, part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one device drivers had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the heat protection. They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.|$|E
