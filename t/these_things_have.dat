500|$|The next day, Yukito meets a {{girl named}} Kano Kirishima and a stray dog named Potato; Kano and Misuzu {{go to the same}} high school. Later that day, Yukito meets a third girl named Minagi Tohno, Misuzu's classmate, and her friend Michiru. Like Misuzu, both Kano and Minagi have strange personalities {{connected}} with mysterious pasts. Before long, a legend of [...] "one thousand summers" [...] begins to unfold where the mysteries of the past are framed primarily by the relationship between Yukito and Misuzu. The cursed [...] "girl in the sky" [...] Yukito has been searching for turns out to be Misuzu. By the time he figures this out, she has already grown to love him and has passed her 15th birthday. Once <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>have</b> come to pass, the [...] "girl in the sky" [...] is cursed to die. The remainder of this arc is dedicated to Yukito's attempt to save her, trying to effectively break the curse.|$|E
500|$|In the stanzas that follow, Helgi {{responds}} {{that none}} of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>have</b> occurred, and so Sigrún's maid goes home to Sigrún. The maid tells Sigrún that the burial mound has opened up, and that Sigrún should go to Helgi there, as Helgi has asked her to come and tend his wounds, which have opened up and are bleeding. Sigrún goes into the mound, and finds that Helgi is drenched in gore, his hair is thick with frost. Filled with joy at the reunion, Sigrún kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail, and asks how she can heal him. Sigrún makes a bed there, and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound. Helgi awakens, stating that he must [...] "ride along the blood-red roads, to set the pale horse to tread {{the path of the}} sky," [...] and [...] return before the rooster Salgófnir crows. Helgi and the host of men ride away, and Sigrún and her servant go back to their house. Sigrún has her maid wait for him by the mound the next night, but when she arrives at dawn, she finds that he has not returned. The prose narrative {{at the end of the}} poem relates that Sigrún dies of sadness, but that the two are thought to have been reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára.|$|E

"The {{citizens}} of Daviess, Carroll, {{and some other}} normal counties have raised mob after mob {{for the last two}} months for the purpose of driving the Mormons from those counties and from the State. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>have</b> at length goaded the Mormons into a state of desperation that has now made some members to become the aggressors instead of acting on the defensive." ...|$|E

Therefore the keeper in any team is an {{integral}} part of a captain's thought process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bikinis reappeared {{in later}} {{contests}} amid additional controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s the contest was regularly picketed by feminist protesters, who distributed flyers against the indecency of the contest. The pageant disappeared {{for a while}} and in 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in Bangalore, India, dozens of Indian groups who opposed the event claimed that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, [...] "It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>have</b> been added on as sops." [...] The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the [...] "Swimsuit Round" [...] to Seychelles. Countering these claims, the contest organizer says that the organization has raised ₤300 million for charity in many of the countries where it operates since 2000. Feminist groups published fliers against bikinis in the contest in 1970.|$|E
