25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E

500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm. On the evening of 15July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as {{he was at the}} Blomfield Road house. Walley {{accompanied}} Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E
500|$|With the Cardinals down by 25 {{points in}} the fourth quarter, quarterback Neil Lomax threw for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win. One of the touchdowns was to tight end Robert Awalt, the other two to league {{reception}} leader J.T. Smith. Donald Igwebuike's potential game-tying 53-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar as time ran out. The Cardinals came in on a three-game losing streak, while the Buccaneers entered the game leading the league in takeaways. The attendance of 22,449 was the Cardinals' lowest in four years, the team having announced the previous week their plans {{to move to another}} city. Detectives were assigned to guard Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill due to death threats. Irritation over DeBerg's celebrations after his three touchdown passes provided inspiration to some of the Cardinals, who commented, [...] "he's going to lose his job to Vinny Testaverde {{in a couple of weeks}} anyway". Awalt caught nine passes for 124yards, while Smith caught eight passes for 96yards. Said coach Perkins of his team's performance, [...] "...they whipped us in every phase of the game. Even down 28–3, they were playing better football than we were". After the Buccaneers turned three consecutive potential blowout wins into nail-biters, safety Rick Woods said that the team seemed to be playing not to lose instead of playing to win. As an example, he noted that many players <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how much time was left on the clock after Cardinals linebacker Niko Noga returned a James Wilder fumble for a touchdown. The next week, Woods was demoted to the taxi squad. Offensive tackle Rob Taylor suffered a strained medial collateral ligament, and center Randy Grimes was also out for the fourth quarter with a hyperextended knee. [...] "We should have gotten a lot more hurt", Perkins said, and accused his players of allowing positive press coverage to inflate their egos and cloud their judgments. The 25-point lead, if it had held, would have represented the largest margin of victory in a Buccaneers road win. Instead, it became the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{days after}} the fire, on June 8, 1892, Edward O'Kelley entered Ford's tent saloon with a shotgun. According to witnesses, Ford's back was turned. O'Kelley said, [...] "Hello, Bob." [...] As Ford <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who it was, O'Kelley fired both barrels, killing Ford instantly. O'Kelley hence became [...] "the man who killed Robert Ford". O'Kelley's {{sentence}} was commuted because of a medical condition, and he was released on October 3, 1902. O'Kelley was subsequently killed on January 13, 1904 while trying to shoot a policeman.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 15 July 1958, Walley went to visit Lennon at his aunt's house, finding Julia Lennon (Lennon's mother) and Lennon's aunt talking by the front gate of Menlove Avenue. Unfortunately, Lennon was not there, as {{he was at his}} mother's house at 1 Blomfield Road. Walley then {{accompanied}} Lennon's mother to a bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about 100feet from where she had been hit. Lennon refused to talk to Walley for months afterwards, which left Walley with the feeling that Lennon held him responsible.|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
