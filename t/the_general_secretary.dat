5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E

5|$|Ponsford learnt the {{rudiments of}} cricket from his uncle Cuthbert Best—a former club player for Fitzroy. He had the best batting and bowling averages for his school team in 1913, 1914 and 1915 and {{eventually}} rose to the captaincy. His local grade club, Fitzroy, awarded Ponsford a medallion—presented by the local mayor—for being his school's outstanding cricketer in the 1913–14 and 1914–15 seasons. The medallion was awarded along with an honorary membership of the club, and Ponsford trained enthusiastically, running from school to the nearby Brunswick Street Oval in the Edinburgh Gardens to practise in the nets. Les Cody, <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>secretary</b> of Fitzroy Cricket Club and a first-class cricketer with New South Wales and Victoria, was Ponsford's first cricketing role model.|$|E
5|$|The IIC was {{formally}} disbanded in November 1918. Most {{of its members}} became closely associated with communism and the Soviet Union. Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920. Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M. N. Roy, {{was among the first}} Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements. Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>secretary</b> of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Jawaharlal Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927. He later fled Nazi Germany for the Soviet Union but disappeared in 1937 under Joseph Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|Two {{resistance}} movements emerged {{following the}} invasion: the communist-led, multi-ethnic Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted {{almost entirely of}} Serbs. The Partisans were led by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, while the Chetniks were led by Colonel Draža Mihailović, {{an officer in the}} interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war status quo, whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored.|$|E
5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, including those of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary,</b> President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing {{in order to better}} understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try to make a bid for the office of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary.</b> He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>secretary,</b> the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the oblast (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the oblast KPJ committees of {{the decisions of the}} Central Committee, and to form oblast military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an oblast military committee responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each oblast military committee formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure mirrored the KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included the creation of a formal military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn was informally {{chosen as}} the Party's First Secretary (later known as <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Secretary)</b> by Hồ in 1959, at the January plenum of the Central Committee and {{was elected to the}} post de jure at the 3rd National Congress. Lê Duẩn was not Hồ's {{original}} choice for First Secretary according to Bùi Tín; his preferred candidate was Võ Nguyên Giáp, but since Lê Duẩn was supported by the influential Lê Đức Thọ, the Head of the Party Organisational Department, Lê Duẩn was picked for the post. Lê Duẩn was considered a safe choice because of his time in prison during French rule, his thesis The Road to the South and his strong belief in Vietnamese reunification. Hoàng Văn Hoan claimed, after being sent into exile, that the 3rd National Congress also purged several party members. Indeed, three former ambassadors lost their Central Committee seats.|$|E
