5|$|Grenier {{directed}} his well-managed retreat along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Haag, {{with all the}} units falling back in an orderly echelon. To save some artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After falling back , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they assumed a defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours. In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Boston.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of {{infantry}} and M26 Pershing tanks went up <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> the North Korean positions. White flags {{had appeared in}} front of the American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with thermite grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|SH74, {{now known}} as Bear Creek Road, curves east- and northward as it winds out of town. Narrowing to two lanes, the route follows the path of Bear Creek, curving northeasterly toward Kittredge with Pence Park on the east side. In Kittredge, the route meets CR 120 (Myers Gulch Road), which heads {{southeast}} toward Indian Hills. The route again meets Kerr Gulch Road, which bypasses the large curve which SH74 took. From Kittredge, SH74 winds eastward {{on the north side}} of Bear Creek. The roadway passes Idledale north of the Lair O the Bear Park, where it intersects Grapevine Road. East of the town, an abandoned section of SH74 exists, which now serves as a path to private areas. The route heads into Bear Creek Canyon Park, where it curves along the creek in a more rocky terrain. SH74 also passes through Red Rocks Park along the stream. Exiting the park, SH74 enters Morrison, where Bear Creek Road meets SH8 at an intersection. From here, SH8 (Morrison Road) serves as the continuation of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Denver.|$|E

25|$|The 506th's battalions were so {{exhausted}} {{that instead of}} attacking through the hedgerows, they shifted to the left to follow the road from Vierville. Company D, as it had the day before, raced unopposed to Dead Man's Corner and from there up <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Saint Côme-du-Mont. The 1st/401st, unable to overrun German positions in front of them, attempted to flank them on its right. The effect was, that after destroying the German defenders at les Droueries who had held up the division for two days, the 3rd/501st in the center was pinched out of the attack.|$|E
25|$|A {{detachment}} of Union companies from the 32nd Indiana (fewer than 500 men) under Lt. Col. Henry von Trebra fought 1,300 Confederate troops, including Terry's Texas Rangers, the Mississippi artillery, and the Arkansas infantry under Brig. Gen. Hindman. The outmanned 32nd Indiana companies {{fell into a}} defensive square formation; the Rangers responded by storming the Union lines. Battery A, 1st Ohio Light Artillery, and Battery A, Kentucky Light Artillery, provided support to the Union troops from positions {{on the north side}} of the river, while Swett's Company, Light Artillery (Warren Light Artillery) of Mississippi fired on Union reserves and skirmishers along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Munfordville. The Rangers continued their charge and hand-to-hand fighting with the Union infantrymen until the Confederates were finally repelled.|$|E

500|$|Washington then {{finished}} building Fort Necessity at the Great Meadows, {{anticipating a}} French counterattack. The fort, completed June 2, {{was not much}} more than a wooden stockade [...] high and about [...] in diameter surrounded by a ditch. It was so poorly sited (surrounded by higher hills and woods providing cover to the enemy) that Tanacharison tried to point out its defects. Washington dismissed these concerns, convinced the fort could withstand [...] "the attack of 500 Indians." [...] Over the next month, his force grew by 200 men from Virginia and an independent company of 100 British regulars that had marched up from South Carolina, while he continued to build <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> the forks. [...] The arriving Virginians brought congratulations from Governor Dinwiddie on his success at Jumonville Glen, and word that Washington had been promoted to colonel, owing to the death of Colonel Joshua Fry in a fall from his horse.|$|E
500|$|Soon, {{the marching}} men idea blooms with workers coming {{together}} and marching {{to and from}} work in the evenings. Becoming nervous over newspaper reports and rumors of the worker gatherings, several [...] "men of affairs" [...] discuss the matter. David Ormsby volunteers to dissuade to McGregor from further organizing but cannot communicate his point to the impassive McGregor. The marching men movement peaks during a demonstration on Labor Day, climaxing with a speech by McGregor. Riding in a carriage with her father at the fringe of the demonstration, Margaret Ormsby is overcome by McGregor's oration, but later professes her allegiance to her father. The book ends that same night with a solitary David Ormsby, a foil to the stereotype of the ruthless businessman, at his window overlooking the city, meditating on his life choices: [...] "What if McGregor and his woman knew both roads? What if they, after looking deliberately along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> beauty and success in life, went, without regret, along the road to failure? What if McGregor and not myself knew the road to beauty?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the raised alarm, the militiamen of Concord and Lincoln had mustered in Concord. They received reports of firing at Lexington, and were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby, or to stay and defend the town, or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain. [...] A column of militia marched down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Lexington to meet the British, traveling about [...] until they met the approaching column of regulars. [...] As the regulars numbered about 700 and the militia at this time only numbered about 250, the militia column turned around and marched back into Concord, preceding the regulars by {{a distance of about}} [...] [...] The militia retreated to a ridge overlooking the town, and their officers discussed what to do next. Caution prevailed, and Colonel James Barrett withdrew from the town of Concord and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north of town, where they could continue to watch the troop movements of the British and the activities in the center of town. [...] This step proved fortuitous, as the ranks of the militia continued to grow as minuteman companies arriving from the western towns joined them there.|$|E

500|$|On {{the next}} road eastward above Yongch'on, the NK 15th Division {{launched}} its {{attack against the}} ROK 8th Division on September 2. Although far understrength, with its three regiments reportedly having a total of only 3,600 men, it penetrated in four days to the lateral corridor at Yongch'on. North of the town, one regiment of the ROK 8th Division crumbled when a T-34 tank got behind its lines. Elements of the North Korean division were in and south of Yongch'on by September 6. The North Koreans did not remain in the town, but moved to the hills south and southeast of it overlooking the road between Taegu and P'ohang-dong. On September 7 some of the North Korean troops established a roadblock [...] southeast of Yongch'on, and other elements attacked a ROK regiment [...] south of the town. During the day, however, the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division, attacking from the east along the lateral corridor, cleared Yongch'on itself of North Koreans and then went into a defensive position north of the town. But the next day, September 8, additional elements of the NK 15th Division arrived before Yongch'on and recaptured it. That afternoon the ROK 11th Regiment of the ROK 1st Division arrived from the Taegu front and counterattacked the North Koreans in and near the town. This action succeeded in clearing the North Koreans from most of Yongch'on, but some North Koreans still held the railroad station southeast of it. Still others were an unknown distance southeast on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Kyongju.|$|E
500|$|Simcoe's {{troops were}} moving down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> Williamsburg, convoying some cattle with the {{infantry}} and jägers {{in the lead}} under Major Richard Armstrong, with Simcoe and the cavalry about an hour behind them. [...] At Spencer's Ordinary ("" [...] meaning tavern at the time), the troops rejoined and paused to rest. [...] Simcoe ordered fences in the area torn down since [...] "it was an admirable place for the chicanery of action". While they rested, some of the Loyalists went out to round up more cattle found in the area, and the cavalry went to a nearby farm to feed their horses. McPherson's men encountered the latter, whose sentries raised the alarm to the main body. [...] Simcoe's cavalry charged McPherson's formation, breaking it up. [...] McPherson {{and a number of}} his men were unhorsed in the melee, and several were taken prisoner before the leading edge of Butler's main force began to arrive. Simcoe ordered most of the infantry up to support his cavalry, and sent the jägers and light infantry into the woods on the right to flank the arriving enemy column. By questioning the prisoners, Simcoe learned that Lafayette was not far off. [...] He sent word to Cornwallis, dispatched the cattle convoy toward Williamsburg, and ordered trees to be felled to make a barricade across the road as a point of defense. [...] He then arrayed his troops in a way calculated to mislead the Americans into believing that more troops were in formation just over a rise. When Butler's force arrived, Simcoe ordered an infantry charge. [...] This scattered the first wave of Butler's men into the nearby woods, where the jägers then pushed them back. [...] However, Butler's men continued to advance. [...] Simcoe ordered a cavalry charge and fired a field cannon {{to give the impression that}} a larger force was arriving. [...] The charge forced Butler's men back, at which point the two forces disengaged, Simcoe because he was concerned that Lafayette was approaching, and Butler because his men were fooled by Simcoe's stratagem.|$|E

[...] A concrete highway from Norris Corner toward US 40 in Edgewood, as well as a macadam road along Rock Spring Avenue from Bel Air to the community of Frogtown, which is the location of the Bel Air Bypass, were started in 1929.

Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for TIME magazine, told the New York Times, [...] "At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester." [...] He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags. As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action. After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.|$|E
