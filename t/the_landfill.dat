5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. <b>The</b> <b>landfill</b> site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
40|$|Effect of humic {{substances}} on {{the mobility}} of toxic metals in a mature <b>landfill</b> <b>The</b> effect of the aeration of a landfill in its humic phase on the leaching potential of deposited metals has been investigated. Aeration increased the cation- exchange capacity, but decreased the buffering capacity and the metal-binding capacity. Leachates from <b>the</b> aerated <b>landfill</b> contained {{less than half the}} amount of aluminium, iron and molybdenum and more than double the amount of calcium, magnesium, sulfur and zinc of leachates derived from an identical, but anaerobic, <b>landfill.</b> <b>The</b> leachate from <b>the</b> aerated <b>landfill</b> was capable of extracting metals from <b>the</b> original <b>landfill</b> when recirculated. Leachate from <b>the</b> original <b>landfill</b> treated with leachate from <b>the</b> aerated <b>landfill</b> contained {{more than twice as much}} aluminium, boron, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and zinc than leachate from <b>the</b> identical anaerobic <b>landfill.</b> It was concluded that {{the mobility of}} deposited metals in landfills will change over time as the ageing of <b>the</b> <b>landfills</b> progresses and conditions become more oxidized.

As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach <b>the</b> <b>landfill</b> where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

25|$|The City began {{landfill}} {{operations on}} Tallapoosa Point in Pelham Bay Park in 1963. Plans {{to expand the}} landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City’s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition. <b>The</b> <b>landfill</b> expansion {{was seen as a}} way to alleviate the city's accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put <b>the</b> <b>landfill.</b> The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of the Bronx Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. However, the state and federal governments did not favor <b>the</b> <b>landfill</b> being located at Tallapoosa. On October 11, 1967, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where <b>the</b> <b>landfill</b> was planned to be expanded. Tallapoosa West continued {{to be used as a}} landfill until May 1968, when <b>the</b> <b>landfill</b> permit was revoked. In November of that year, Tallapoosa West was made a part of the Pell refuge. The dump still existed as late as 1975, when the garbage there was described as being ten stories high.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{national}} environmental goals, 191 closed landfills were inventoried {{according to a}} national methodology for inventory of polluted areas. The inventory took place in thirteen of the municipalities {{in the region of}} Västerbotten during the summer of 2013. 159 of <b>the</b> <b>landfills</b> were classified to risk class 3 on a scale of 4. Landfills in this category consist of diverse nature, ranging from adequate coverage but poor placement, to insufficient coverage and visible leakage, but without urgent risk. The purpose of this report was to follow up on the inventory. It resulted in identifying and prioritizing the actions required and a general plan of action for <b>the</b> <b>landfills</b> in <b>the</b> region. The focus was mainly on landfills in class 3, but those in risk class 2 are also included. This report was based mostly on forms for <b>the</b> closed <b>landfills</b> and a survey aimed at regional administrations. The result showed that the most common actions required were clean up, coverage, investigation of leakage and information about the unsuitability of depositing waste, including yard waste, at a closed landfill. A status division of <b>the</b> <b>landfills</b> in class 3 was determined, where <b>the</b> <b>landfills</b> that required actions were assigned the statuses +, 0 or -. Criteria for + includes proximity to vulnerable nature, risk for contamination of drinking water, poor coverage, or visible leakage. <b>The</b> <b>landfills</b> in class 2 should be prioritized for further actions, and after that those in risk class 3 with the + status...|$|R

25|$|Landfilling {{practices}} in the UK have had to change {{in recent years to}} meet the challenges of the European Landfill Directive. The UK now imposes landfill tax upon biodegradable waste which is put into landfills.
