By considering two different sources for SO 2 and H 2 S as above, the difference of the ratio may be attributed to a difference in mixing ratio of magmatic and hydrothermal gases. Compared to <b>the</b> 2014 <b>eruption,</b> input of <b>the</b> magmatic fluid might be much larger in <b>the</b> 1979 <b>eruption.</b> Alternatively, a size of hydrothermal system might have been smaller in <b>the</b> 1979 <b>eruption</b> compared to that in <b>the</b> 2014 <b>eruption.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before <b>the</b> <b>eruption.</b> The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During <b>the</b> <b>eruption,</b> the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After <b>the</b> <b>eruption,</b> the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E

The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24cumi), and the island's highest point was 174metres (570ft) above sea level at that time.|$|E

5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding <b>the</b> <b>eruption.</b> The evening before <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before <b>the</b> <b>eruption,</b> Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before <b>the</b> <b>eruption,</b> Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E

5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to trigger the {{downfall}} of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} <b>the</b> <b>eruption.</b> As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after <b>the</b> <b>eruption.</b> Many archaeologists speculate that <b>the</b> <b>eruption</b> caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>eruption</b> {{produced}} pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that {{was observed in}} Arenas' crater several months before <b>the</b> <b>eruption.</b> Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E
