5|$|Texas's large population, {{abundance}} of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers {{of higher education}} have contributed to a large and diverse economy.

5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target.

During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
