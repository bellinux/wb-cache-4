25|$|Common {{confusion}} is that public goods are goods {{provided by the}} public sector. Although it {{is often the case}} <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> involved in producing public goods, this is not necessarily the case. Public goods may be naturally available.

[...] MQM head Altaf Hussain said, [...] "I welcome this operation and I am glad <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> supporting the armed forces, those who have not backed the operation must realize that {{it is a matter of}} national security.

500|$|The book {{reveals that}} members of the {{organisation}} had attempted to donate funds to the 2007 re-election campaign of Prime Minister of Australia John Howard in a way in which information about the financing would not have been available to the general public. Individuals describing themselves as a [...] "private group" [...] had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney, and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation. The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing question. They said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections. [...] "We're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren. I regard many of the party's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent. What the [...] Party stands for should not be confused {{in the mind of the}} electorate by the acceptance of donations from fringe groups. In my view, if you accept this money, you're arguably accepting some of their opinions," [...] said the book's source, explaining that he had turned down the offer of funds from the organisation.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, Sidney {{believed}} that civil government should have limited jurisdiction. [...] He said the, [...] "only ends for which governments are constituted and obedience rendered to them, are the obtaining {{of justice and}} protection." [...] This suggests a limited civil government whose primary purpose is to 1) render legal justice through its court system and 2) provide {{for the safety of}} its citizens. [...] We can also conclude from Sidney that, if a government fails to accomplish these basic components, obedience to <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> no longer required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upgrading}} {{of public}} housing, including the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP), {{is a major}} issue in this election. As in previous elections, the PAP had tied the scheduling of housing upgrades to the number of votes the party received in the election. The PAP argues <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> successful in raising the standard of living in the country, and those who support its various policies, including the upgrading, should be given priority. In the hotly contested Aljunied GRC, George Yeo (PAP) has placed lift upgrading the [...] "top of [...] priority list" [...] so that the lift would stop on every floor in as many blocks as possible.|$|E

These very early pregnancies could never be policed, regardless. Such circumstances would be dealt with by each individual making his or her own moral choice.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 January 2010, Uganda's Media Centre, a government-sponsored website, {{released}} a statement titled [...] "Uganda is being judged too harshly", reacting to the worldwide media attention the country has received about the bill, stating that, {{in response to the}} negative press they have received, it is obvious that [...] "Ugandans (read Africans) have no right to discuss and no right to sovereignty". The message asserted [...] "It is unfortunate that Uganda is now being judged on the actions of opportunists whose ideas are based on violence and blackmail and even worse, on the actions of aid attached strings. (Homosexuality). It is regrettable <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> pretentiously expected to observe their 'human rights', yet, by their own actions, they have surrendered their right to human rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be argued that in a democracy, because the {{government}} is the party performing the act of imposing taxes, {{society as a whole}} decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution's [...] "No taxation without representation" [...] slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, [...] "An old tax is a good tax". Conservatives advocate the [...] "fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe <b>that</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government 'services'." [...] Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision {{of a wide range of}} services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Tony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. Many libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty.|$|E
2500|$|Henry was {{involved}} in the first dispute within the Congress, on whether each colony should have an equal vote, taking the position that there should be proportionate representation, with the larger colonies to have a greater voice. He argued that colonial borders must be swept away in the need for Americans to unify and create a government to fill the void left with the end of British authority, [...] "Fleets and armies and the present state of things shew <b>that</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> dissolved. Where are your landmarks? your boundaries of colonies? The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American." [...] Henry lost the argument, and his theatrics made Congress's leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on the lead committee, that charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights. Instead, he was put on the next-important committee, one inquiring into commercial regulation. In the end, though, neither committee produced much of importance. Henry believed the purpose of the Congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war. In this, he found common cause with John Adams and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, but not all were of that opinion. According to Tate, Henry [...] "turned out not to be an especially influential member of the body". The Congress decided on a petition to the King; Henry prepared two drafts but neither proved satisfactory. When Congress on October 26 approved a draft prepared by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, who had consulted with Henry and also Richard Henry Lee, Henry had already departed for home, and Lee signed on his behalf. The petition was rejected in [...] London.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a popular}} {{impression}} <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> resistant to change and innovation, {{and that this is}} due to a combination of overly bureaucratic processes and a culture of risk aversion. It is debatable that this is well-founded, theoretically or empirically: government bodies differ from private sectors in their structures and objectives, formalised decision-making processes may aid innovation rather than inhibiting it, and the assumption <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> excessively risk-averse assumes that private sector decisions on risk are correct - an assumption which is hard to sustain given recent economic history. This paper brings together ideas from public administration, behavioural psychology and economics to ask whether the anti-innovation government has any theoretical or empirical basis. It argues there is some truth in the claim <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> less likely to innovate; but the paper also argues that a missing piece of the puzzle is provided by incentive structures in government which encourage the status quo irrespective of risk preferences. However, the evidence for these negative incentives is largely anecdotal and derives from those who could be seen to have an interest in this perspective, and so {{there is a need for}} more empirical research to explore this idea...|$|R

This paper demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> respond to domestic public opinion even when acting {{at the international}} level. Specifically, we examine conflict in the European Union’s primary legislative body, the Council of the European Union (EU). We argue that domestic electoral incentives compel governments to react to public opinion. Analyzing a unique dataset on all legislative decisions adopted in the Council since 1999, we show <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> more likely to oppose legislative proposals that extend the level and scope of EU authority when their domestic electorates are skeptical about the EU. We also find <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> more responsive when the issue of European integration is salient in domestic party politics. Our findings demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> can use the international stage to signal their responsiveness to public concerns and that such signals resonate in the domestic political debate...|$|R
