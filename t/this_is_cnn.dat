Edges are an important character to feature extraction of the images. Based on Matlab 7. 0, the experimental results, compared with the traditional edge detection algorithm Canny, show that CNN can not only be available but quickly detect the complete image edges. This paper also proposes {{an effective way to}} eliminate the false edges and deduces the range of CNN template parameters.

40|$|Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) {{has had a}} {{great success}} in the recent past, because of the advent of faster GPUs and memory access. <b>CNNs</b> <b>are</b> really {{powerful}} as they {{learn the features from}} data in layers such that they exhibit the structure of the V- 1 features of the human brain. A huge bottleneck, in <b>this</b> case, <b>is</b> that <b>CNNs</b> <b>are</b> very large and have a very high memory footprint, and hence they cannot be employed on devices with limited storage such as mobile phone, IoT etc. In this work, we study the model complexity versus accuracy trade-off on MNSIT dataset, and give a concrete framework for handling such a problem, given the worst case accuracy that a system can tolerate. In our work, we reduce the model complexity by 236 times, and memory footprint by 19. 5 times compared to the base model while achieving worst case accuracy threshold...|$|R

40|$|Pedestrian {{detection}} is {{an important}} field with applications in active safety systems for cars as well as autonomous driving. Since autonomous driving and active safety are becoming technically feasible now the interest for these applications has dramatically increased. The aim of <b>this</b> thesis <b>is</b> to investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for pedestrian detection. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that <b>CNN</b> have recently beensuccessfully applied to several different computer vision problems. The main applications of pedestrian detection are in real time systems. For this reason,this thesis investigates strategies for reducing the computational complexity offorward propagation for CNN. The approach used in this thesis for extracting pedestrians {{is to use a}} CNN tofind a probability map of where pedestrians <b>are</b> located. From <b>this</b> probabilitymap bounding boxes for pedestrians are generated. A method for handling scale invariance for the objects of interest has also <b>been</b> developed in <b>this</b> thesis. Experiments show that using this method givessignificantly better results for the problem of pedestrian detection. The accuracy which this thesis has managed to achieve is similar to the accuracy for some other works which use CNN...|$|R

40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} (<b>CNN)</b> <b>are</b> extensions to deep {{neural networks}} (DNN) {{which are used}} as alternate acoustic models with state-of-the-art performances for speech recognition. In <b>this</b> paper, <b>CNNs</b> <b>are</b> used as acoustic models for speech activity detection (SAD) on data collected over noisy radio communication channels. When these SAD models are tested on audio recorded from radio channels not seen during training, there is severe performance degradation. We attribute this degradation to mismatches between the two dimensional filters learnt in the initial CNN layers and the novel channel data. Using {{a small amount of}} supervised data from the novel channels, the filters can be adapted to provide significant improvements in SAD performance. In mismatched acoustic conditions, the adapted models provide significant improvements (about 10 - 25 %) relative to conventional DNN-based SAD systems. These results illustrate that CNNs have a considerable advantage in fast adaptation for acoustic modeling in these settings.

30|$|In many recent {{publications}} of medical image analysis, <b>CNN</b> <b>was</b> reported to outperform classical methods for imaging modalities other than PET/CT. In <b>this</b> study, <b>CNN</b> <b>is</b> not {{significantly better than}} RF, AdaBoost, or SVM, because it has not fully explored the functional nature of PET. Before the image patches <b>are</b> input to <b>CNN,</b> the pixel intensities are normalized {{to a range of}} [− 1, 1], thus the discriminative power of SUV is lost during the normalization. It was surprising to find that without the important SUV feature, the difference between CNN and the best classical methods <b>is</b> not evident. <b>CNN</b> utilizes the image appearance pattern around the lymph node. The appearance pattern includes information of local contrast, nearby tissues, boundary sharpness, and etc. Such information is different from but as powerful as the diagnostic features like SUV, tumor size, and local heterogeneity. To illustrate the discriminative power of the image appearance pattern, we extracted the intermediate feature vector produced by the internal flattening layer of the <b>CNN.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> a vector of 512 features, which could be considered as a sparse representation of the image patch’s appearance. We used the 512 features as the input of the classical methods. For RF, the 512 features resulted in AUC and ACC of 0.89 and 80.8 %, respectively. For SVM, the AUC and ACC were 0.89 and 80.6 %, respectively. These results were much higher than the AUC and ACC of T 82, and they were even close to the results of D 13. Unlike the texture features, the appearance patterns of <b>CNN</b> <b>are</b> not affected {{by the size of the}} lymph nodes, because they are computed from the entire image patch which includes both the lymph node and its surrounding tissues. Therefore, the image appearance pattern can be a promising substitute for the texture features, as well as a good compensation to the diagnostic features.|$|R
