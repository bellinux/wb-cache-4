40|$|Background: Kligman&#x 2032;s <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> formula {{has been}} one of the most popular {{treatment}} options in melasma over the last three decades. The original Kligman&#x 2032;s formula has been modified in many ways over the years and the most recent modification that has been introduced is a <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> of 2 &#x 0025; hydroquinone, 0. 025 &#x 0025; tretinoin, and 1 &#x 0025; mometasone. The use of this <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> in patients with melasma has seen a sharp rise over the last few years and with this rampant use the side-effect profile of this <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> has also come to the fore. Aim : The aim of the present study was to assess the overall safety of the mometasone-based <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment in the management of melasma. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 60 patients of melasma who had used a mometasone-based <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment for at least 3 weeks anytime in the previous 1 year. The patients were given a preformed questionnaire wherein they assessed the overall effect of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment on their melasma during its use as well as after its withdrawal. The patients were specifically asked about the status of their disease as well as the sun sensitivity of their skin before and after the use of <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment. In addition, the patients were assessed by a single trained dermatologist for the presence of any adverse effects arising out of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment in the form of telangiectasia, hypertrichosis, acne, skin atrophy, etc. Results: Majority of patients (51. 7 &#x 0025;) had used the combination treatment well beyond the recommended duration. About one-third (36. 7 &#x 0025;) of the patients rated their melasma as worse at the time of filling the questionnaire as compared with their disease before the use of <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment. On clinical examination, the evidence of steroid side effects was seen in 26 patients (43. 3 &#x 0025;). Steroid-induced telangiectasia was the commonest finding, seen in all of these 26 patients. Steroid-induced skin atrophy, hypertrichosis, and acneiform eruption were seen in 19, 17, and 11 patients, respectively. Conclusions: The propensity of a mometasone-based <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment to cause steroid adverse effects on the facial skin should always be borne in mind when the same is prescribed as a treatment option in melasma...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of efficient anti-cancer therapy {{has been a}} topic of intense interest for several decades. Combined administration of certain molecules and immune cells {{has been shown to}} be an effective form of anti-cancer therapy. Here, we examined the effects of administering an immune stimulating peptide (WKYMVm), 5 -fluoro-uracil (5 -FU), and mature dendritic cells (mDCs) against heterotopic cancer animal model. Administration of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> strongly reduced tumor volume in CT- 26 -inoculated heterotopic cancer animal model. The induced anti-tumor activity was well correlated with FAS expression, caspase- 3 activation, and cancer cell apoptosis. The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> treatment caused recruitment of CD 8 T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells into the tumor. The production of two cytokines, IFN-c and IL- 12, were strongly stimulated by administration of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> Depletion of CD 8 T lymphocytes or NK cells by administration of anti-CD 8 or anti-asialoGM 1 antibody inhibited the anti-tumor activity and cytokine production of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> strongly inhibited metastasis of colon cancer cells in a heterotopic cancer animal model as well as in a metastatic cancer animal model, and enhanced the survival rate of the mice model. Adoptive transfer of CD 8 T lymphocytes and NK cells further increased the survival rate.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To compare two {{antiretroviral}} regimens, loviride plus lamivudine (3 TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) (<b>triple</b> <b>combination)</b> and loviride plus ZDV (double combination) {{in terms}} of pharmacokinetic interactions, tolerability, safety, and immunological and virological efficacy. Study design: An open, case-controlled, pharmacokinetic and 24 -week continuous treatment pilot study. Patients: Twenty p 24 antigen-positive patients, 10 per treatment group, were matched according to p 24 antigenaemia less or more than 100 pg, CD 4 count less or more than 150 x 10 (6) / 1, and gender. Eight out of 10 cases and seven out of 10 Controls had received previous antiretroviral therapy. Results: No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Both treatment combinations were well tolerated. Median absolute and percentage CD 4 count increases above baseline were more pronounced in the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> arm than in the double combination arm. Median p 24 -antigen and plasma viraemia level decreases below baseline were more pronounced in the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> arm. The M(184) I/V mutation was detected in all plasma samples of <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> patients examined at week 12. Mutations conferring resistance to loviride and ZDV were found in a significant subset of patients in both treatment arms. Conclusions: Both combination regimens have an excellent safety/tolerability profile, but {{a higher level of}} in vivo efficacy is achieved by the <b>triple</b> <b>combination,</b> despite genotypic changes conferring resistance to one or all of these agents. The conclusions drawn are limited by small population size and the heterogenous pretreatment history. However, they support the validity of and strongly encourage a rationally designed multidrug combination approach to HIV therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} COPD therapy are {{to prevent and}} control symptoms, reduce the {{frequency}} and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance. The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has become an option for maintenance treatment of COPD and as a “step-up” therapy from single or double combination treatments. There is evidence that <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> ICS/LABA/LAMA with different inhalers improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations. A new <b>triple</b> fixed-dose <b>combination</b> of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate (100 µg/puff) /formoterol fumarate (6 µg/puff) /glycopyrronium bromide (12. 5 µg/puff) has been developed as a hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhaler. Two large pivotal studies showed that this extrafine fixed ICS/LABA/LAMA <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> is superior to fixed ICS/LABA combined therapy and also superior to the LAMA tiotropium in terms of lung function and exacerbation prevention in COPD patients at risk of exacerbation.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} microdilution method was {{developed}} to assess double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of antibiotics. Five antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and imipenem were tested against 10 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each isolate was tested against ten double and nine <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of the antibiotics. A 96 -well plate {{was used to test}} three antibiotics, each one alone and in double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> against each isolate. The minimum bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentrations in combination were determined with respect to the most potent antibiotic. An Interaction Code (IC) was generated for each combination, where a numerical value was designated based on the 2 -fold increase or decrease in the MICs with respect to the most potent antibiotic. The results of the combinations were verified by time-kill assay at constant concentrations of the antibiotics and in a chemostat. Only 13 % of the double combinations were synergistic, whereas 5 % showed antagonism. Forty-three percent of the <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> were synergistic with no antagonism observed, and 100 % synergism was observed in combination of ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftazidime. The presented protocol is simple and fast and can help the clinicians in the early selection of the effective antibiotic therapy for treatment of severe infections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{spread of}} carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CPKP) {{has become a}} {{significant}} problem worldwide. Combination therapy for CPKP is encouraging, but polymyxin resistance to many antibiotics is hampering effective treatment. Combination therapy with three or more antibiotics is being increasingly reported, therefore we performed a systematic review of <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> cases {{in an effort to}} evaluate their clinical effectiveness for CPKP infections. Methods The PubMed database was searched to identify all published clinical outcomes of CPKP infections treated with <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy. Articles were stratified into two tiers depending on the level of clinical detail provided. A tier 1 study included: antibiotic regimen, regimen-specific outcome, patient status at onset of infection, and source of infection. Articles not reaching these criteria were considered tier 2. Results Thirty-three studies were eligible, 23 tier 1 and ten tier 2. Among tier 1 studies, 53 cases were included in this analysis. The most common infection was pneumonia (31 %) followed by primary or catheter-related bacteremia (21 %) and urinary tract infection (17 %). Different combinations of antibiotic classes were utilized in <b>triple</b> <b>combinations,</b> the most common being a polymyxin (colistin or polymyxin B, 86. 8 %), tigecycline (73. 6 %), aminoglycoside (43. 4 %), or carbapenem (43. 4 %). Clinical and microbiological failure occurred in 14 / 39 patients (35. 9 %) and 22 / 42 patients (52. 4 %), respectively. Overall mortality for patients treated with <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy was 35. 8 % (19 / 53 patients). Conclusions <b>Triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy is being considered as a treatment option for CPKP. Polymyxin-based therapy is the backbone antibiotic in these regimens, but its effectiveness needs establishing in prospective clinical trials...|$|R

Methods: A human melanoma cell line with the B-RAF (V 600 E) mutation (A 375 mel) was exposed to B-RAF inhibitor (GSK 2118436), MEK inhibitor (GSK 1120212) and AurkA inhibitor (MLN 8054) as single agents or in various combinations (BRAF plus AurkA inhibitor, MEK plus AurkA inhibitor or <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> BRAF plus MEK plus AurkA inhibitor). Cell proliferation was assessed using xCELLigence technology. Total protein extracts were examined for p 53 and c-Myc protein expression by Western blot analysis. Drug anti-tumor effects were further assessed using a 3 D-human melanoma skin reconstruction model, in which tissues were incubated with serum-free medium containing control, B-RAF plus MEK inhibitor, MEK plus AurkA inhibitor or the <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> Results: AurkA inhibitor plus B-RAF inhibitor, AurkA inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor or <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> had a markedly greater anti-proliferative effect on A 375 (BRAFV 600 E) melanoma cells than single agents. In the 3 D human skin model, the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> had a greater anti-tumor effect at the epidermal/dermal junction than control or either double combination.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of combining antiangiogenic treatment, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting and irradiation (RT). We evaluated AZD 2171, a highly potent, orally active, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling inhibitor, gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and RT. The antitumour efficacy of these treatments, administered alone and in combination for 2 weeks, was assessed in a VEGF-secreting human head and neck tumour cell line, CAL 33 that highly expresses EGFR, established as xenografts (250 [*]mm 3) in nude mice. The median time to reach a tumour volume of 1000 [*]mm 3 was significantly increased for AZD 2171 or gefitinib alone compared with the control. Greater inhibition of tumour growth was seen with the combination of AZD 2171 +gefitinib compared with either drug alone, and the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> compared with either AZD 2171 +gefitinib or RT alone. The intensity of endothelial cell staining was slightly reduced by each agent given alone, and markedly diminished by the double or <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> almost completely abolished cell proliferation. The marked RT-induced enhancement in the DNA-repair enzyme ERCC 1 expression was totally abolished by the <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> This observation could help to explain the supra-additive antitumour effect produced by this combination and could provide a basis for future innovative clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|We {{have tested}} <b>triple</b> and quadruple <b>combinations</b> of human {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs), which are directed against various epitopes on {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoproteins, and a high-titer anti-HIV- 1 human immunoglobulin (HIVIG) preparation for their abilities to neutralize a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-vpu+). This virus encodes the HIV- 1 strain IIIB env, tat, rev, and vpu genes. The quantitative nature of the Chou-Talalay method (Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22 : 27 – 55, 1984) allows ranking of various combinations under identical experimental conditions. Of all <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> tested, the most potent neutralization was seen with MAbs 694 / 98 D plus 2 F 5 plus 2 G 12 (directed against domains on V 3, gp 41, and gp 120, respectively) {{as measured by the}} total MAb concentration required to reach 90 % neutralization (90 % effective concentration [EC 90], 2. 0 μg/ml). All <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> involving MAbs and/or HIVIG that were tested yielded synergy with combination index values of < 1; the dose reduction indices (DRIs) ranged from 3. 1 to 26. 2 at 90 % neutralization. When four MAbs (the previous three plus MAb F 105, directed against the CD 4 binding site) were combined, higher neutralization potency (EC 90, 1. 8 μg/ml) and a higher degree of synergy compared to any <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> were seen. The mean DRIs of the quadruple combination were approximately twice that of the most synergistic <b>triple</b> <b>combination.</b> We conclude that human MAbs targeting different HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein epitopes exhibit strong synergy when used in combination, a fact that could be exploited clinically for passive immunoprophylaxis against HIV- 1...|$|R

Conclusions : These findings provide new prospects for melanoma research, including combined B-RAF/AurkA inhibition for B-RAF mutated melanomas and MEK/AurkA inhibitor combination for patients without B-RAF mutations. Moreover, for the first time, we have shown that a B-RAF, MEK and AurkA inhibitor <b>triple</b> drug <b>combination</b> offers increased efficacy against melanoma cell growth and might {{be considered as a}} potential treatment strategy for enhancing clinical response in melanoma. However, although this <b>triple</b> drug <b>combination</b> was more effective at the epidermal/dermal junction, the suggested presence of alive and proliferating melanoma cells in the dermal stratum could result in drug resistance and disease recurrence.

40|$|Three {{antibody}} reagents that neutralize primary {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) isolates were tested for magnitude and breadth of neutralization when used alone or in double or <b>triple</b> <b>combinations.</b> Hyperimmune anti-HIV immunoglobulin (HIVIG) {{is derived from the}} plasma of HIV- 1 -infected donors, and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 2 F 5 and 2 G 12 bind to distinct regions of the HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein. The antibodies were initially tested against a panel of 15 clade B HIV- 1 isolates, using a single concentration that is achievable in vivo (HIVIG, 2, 500 microg/ml; MAbs, 25 microg/ml). Individual antibody reagents neutralized many of the viruses tested, but antibody potency varied substantially among the viruses. The virus neutralization produced by double combinations of HIVIG plus 2 F 5 or 2 G 12, the two MAbs together, or the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> of HIVIG, 2 F 5, and 2 G 12 was generally equal to or greater than that predicted by the effect of individual antibodies. Overall, the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> displayed the greatest magnitude and breadth of neutralization. Synergistic neutralization was evaluated by analyzing data from dose-response curves of each individual antibody reagent compared to the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> and was demonstrated against each of four viruses tested. Therefore, combinations of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-HIV antibodies can produce additive or synergistic neutralization of primary HIV- 1 isolates.

40|$|Objective-Vasculogenic {{progenitor}} cell therapy for ischemic diseases bears great potential but still requires further optimization for justifying its clinical application. Here, we investigated {{the effects of}} in vivo tissue engineering by combining vasculogenic progenitors with injectable scaffolds releasing controlled amounts of proangiogenic growth factors. Methods and Results-We produced biodegradable, injectable polylactic coglycolic acid-based scaffolds releasing single factors or combinations of vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and angiopoietin- 1. Dual and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of scaffold-released growth factors were superior to single release. In murine hindlimb ischemia models, scaffolds releasing dual (vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) or <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> improved effects of cord blood-derived vasculogenic progenitors. Increased migration, homing, and incorporation of vasculogenic progenitors into the vasculature augmented capillary density, translating into improved blood perfusion. Most importantly, scaffold-released <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> including the vessel stabilizer angiopoietin- 1 enhanced the number of perivascular smooth muscle actin(+) vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating more efficient vessel stabilization. Conclusion-Vasculogenic {{progenitor cell}} therapy is significantly enhanced by in vivo tissue engineering providing a proangiogenic and provasculogenic growth factor-enriched microenvironment. Therefore, combined use of scaffold-released growth factors and cell therapy improves neovascularization in ischemic diseases and may translate into more pronounced clinical effect...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study was a prospective study of 163 women with gynecologic cancers. We compared the digestive symptoms scores (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, and dietary intake) of 37 women with ovarian cancers before and after aprepitant administration. We also compared these symptoms in women who underwent 193 cycles of <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy with symptoms of women who underwent 226 cycles of double <b>combination</b> therapy. For <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy, azasetron, dexamethasone (reduced dose: 40 % of 20 mg), and aprepitant (125 mg) were administered on Day 1, followed by only aprepitant (80 mg) administration on Days 2 and Day 3. RESULTS: In 37 women with ovarian cancer, three symptoms, nausea, appetite loss, and dietary intake, were significantly improved by primarily adding aprepitant to double combination therapy in the delayed phase of MEC. Upon comparing their digestive symptoms in all cycles, however, these three symptoms were not significantly different in the delayed phase. Furthermore, all four symptoms in all cycles were worse following <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy than following double combination therapy in the acute phase (p< 0. 02). The control of digestive symptoms was generally insufficient without the administration of dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Primary aprepitant as an addition to MEC demonstrated efficacy in improving digestive symptoms in the delayed phase. However, its effect may decrease with repeated use. To improve the antiemetic effect, the dose reduction of dexamethasone should be restricted on Day 1 and dexamethasone should be used throughout the delayed phase as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{recurring}} {{emergence of}} influenza virus strains that {{are resistant to}} available antiviral medications has become a global health concern, {{especially in light of}} the potential for a new influenza virus pandemic. Currently, virtually all circulating strains of influenza A virus in the United States are resistant to either of the two major classes of anti-influenza drugs (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors). Thus, new therapeutic approaches that can be rapidly deployed and that will address the issue of recurring resistance should be developed. We have tested double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of the approved anti-influenza drugs oseltamivir and amantadine together with ribavirin against three influenza virus strains using cytopathic effect inhibition assays in MDCK cells. We selected A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99 (H 1 N 1) and A/Sydney/ 05 / 97 (H 3 N 2) as representatives of the wild-type versions of the predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains and A/Duck/MN/ 1525 / 81 (H 5 N 1) as a representative of avian influenza virus strains. Dose-response curves were generated for all drug combinations, and the degree of drug interaction was quantified using a model that calculates the synergy (or antagonism) between the drugs in double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations.</b> This report demonstrates that a <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> of antivirals was highly synergistic against influenza A virus. Importantly, the synergy of the <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> was 2 - to 13 -fold greater than the synergy of any double combination depending on the influenza virus subtype.

Interactions between antifungal drugs were also evaluated by agar diffusion tests. Combinations of caspofungin with either amphotericin B or voriconazole were additive for all the isolates, and antagonism was not observed. The interaction between caspofungin and flucytosine was synergistic for 62 % of the isolates. In contrast, the interaction between voriconazole and flucytosine was never synergistic and antagonism was noted for 93 % of the isolates. The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> of caspofungin with flucytosine and amphotericin B was synergistic for all the isolates tested. The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> of caspofungin with flucytosine and voriconazole was also mostly synergistic; but complex interactions were obtained for some isolates, with synergy or antagonism depending on the concentrations of caspofungin and voriconazole.

Group A patients were asked to apply the cream only and Group B patients received oral tranexamic acid 250 mg twice daily and applied a <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> cream containing fluocinolone acetonide 0. 01 %, tretinoin 0. 05 %, and hydroquinone 2 % once daily for 8 weeks. Response was evaluated using melasma area severity index (MASI) at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results : 40 patients completed the study. The MASI scores at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks in group A were 15. 425 + 1. 09, 11. 075 + 9. 167 and 6. 995 + 6. 056 respectively and in group B 18. 243 + 1. 05, 6. 135 + 4. 94 and 2. 19 + 3. 38. Intergroup comparison showed a faster reduction in pigmentation in Group B as compared to Group A and the results were statistically significant at 4 weeks (P value 0. 014) and 8 weeks (P value 0. 000). The efficacy was maintained throughout the 6 -month follow-up period. Conclusion: Addition of oral tranexamic acid to fluocinolone-based <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> cream results in a faster and sustained improvement in the treatment of melasma...|$|R

Methods: This 8 -week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study, after 1 - 4 weeks single-blind placebo run-in period, randomized 1191 patients to receive once-daily aliskiren/amlodipine 150 / 5 mg (n = 287), aliskiren/HCT 150 / 12. 5 mg (n = 298), amlodipine/HCT 5 / 12. 5 mg (n = 296), or aliskiren/amlodipine/HCT 150 / 5 / 12. 5 mg (up-titrated from aliskiren/HCT 150 / 12. 5 mg after initial 3 days) (n = 310) for 4 weeks, followed by forced titration to double the initial dose for the next 4 weeks. Results: Baseline mean sitting SBP and DBP (msSBP/msDBP) was comparable among treatment groups. The aliskiren/amlodipine/HCT combination resulted in significant least squares mean reduction in msSBP/msDBP from baseline to endpoints (week 4, - 30. 7 /- 15. 9 mmHg; week 8, - 37. 9 /- 20. 6 mmHg), superior (P < 0. 001) {{to each of the}} dual <b>combinations.</b> The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> was associated with - 27. 8 mmHg reduction in msSBP at week 2, significantly better than the dual combinations (P < 0. 05).

The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has become an option for maintenance treatment of COPD and as a “step-up” therapy from single or double combination treatments. There is evidence that <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> ICS/LABA/LAMA with different inhalers improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations. A new <b>triple</b> fixed-dose <b>combination</b> of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate (100 µg/puff) /formoterol fumarate (6 µg/puff) /glycopyrronium bromide (12. 5 µg/puff) has been developed as a hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhaler. Two large pivotal studies showed that this extrafine fixed ICS/LABA/LAMA <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> is superior to fixed ICS/LABA combined therapy and also superior to the LAMA tiotropium in terms of lung function and exacerbation prevention in COPD patients at risk of exacerbation. This review considers the new information provided by these clinical trials of extrafine triple therapy and the implications for the clinical management of COPD patients.

Methods: Surgical specimens obtained from a 68 -year-old female HCC patient were analyzed by <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> array, and identified Dynamin 3 (DNM 3) as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in HCC. Subsequently, samples from 48 HCC patients were evaluated for DNM 3 methylation and expression status using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; MSP) and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR, respectively. The relationship between clinicopathological factors and DNM 3 methylation status was also investigated. Results: DNM 3 was shown to be hypermethylated (methylation value 0. 879, range 0 – 1. 0) in cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue (0. 213) by methylation array in the 68 -year-old female patient. Expression arrays revealed decreased expression of DNM 3 in cancerous tissue. SNP arrays revealed that the copy number of chromosome 1 q 24. 3, in which DNM 3 resides, was normal. MSP revealed hypermethylation of the DNM 3 promoter region in 33 of 48 tumor samples. A trend toward decreased DNM 3 expression was observed in patients with DNM 3 promoter methylation (P = 0. 189). Furthermore, patients with reduced expression of DNM 3 in tumor tissues exhibited worse prognosis with decreased disease specific survival compared to patients without decreased expression (P = 0. 014). Conclusion: The present study indicates that a <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> array strategy is an effective method to detect novel genes related to HCC. We propose that DNM 3 is a tumor suppressor gene in HCC. Keywords: DNM 3, hepatocellular carcinoma, methylation, <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> arra...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn this study, we modify {{previously}} published models {{to estimate the}} short- and long-term consequences of nevirapine <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy use in five developed countries. Current pharmacoeconomic practice requires the de novo model development for each new therapy comparison. This approach is lengthy and costly, and it may yield models with very different structures. Standardized, detailed disclosure of model assumptions and parameters {{makes it possible to}} recycle published models with minor structural modifications to examine the efficiency of therapies based on new trial data. MethodsTwo well-publicized models of HIV therapy are modified to fit new trial data comparing double and <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy with nevirapine; model parameters are adjusted to represent clinical practice and cost structure in five countries. A short-term model uses trial data from advanced-stage patients to estimate first-year costs and consequences. A long-term model uses data from antiretroviral-naïve patients to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness. ResultsDuring the first year, for each 100 individuals treated with nevirapine <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy, 2. 7 deaths and 30. 8 – 31. 4 opportunistic disease events would be averted compared to employing dual therapy. Additionally, 61 % to 142 % of the first-year costs of nevirapine therapy would be offset by other medical care costs savings [FF 19, 749, DM 3, 778, 3334 (× 1000) lire, 293 (× 1000) ptas, and US $ 3, 569]. Compared to dual <b>combination</b> therapy, nevirapine <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> therapy is predicted to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (discounted at 3 %) of FF 101, 057, DM 30, 709, 28, 066 (× 1000) lire, 1294 (× 1000) ptas, and US $ 14, 338. ConclusionPublished, well-constructed, and documented cost-effectiveness models can be reused to estimate the economic impact of therapies for HIV disease. Such models {{can also be used to}} provide insight into the factors that affect efficiency across countries. Our use of clinical trial data on nevirapine, together with published HIV economic models, provides support for the hypothesis that nevirapine is cost-effective under the cost structures of five developed countries...|$|R
