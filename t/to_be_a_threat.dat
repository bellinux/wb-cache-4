5|$|Early on September 26, Tropical Storm Kyle {{was deemed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Bermuda and a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the islands. Later that day the watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning as the storm neared the island. The following day, the warning was discontinued as Hurricane Kyle bypassed the island.|$|E
5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not generally considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E

5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program {{as a source of}} claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{more of the}} {{south-west}} corner {{collapsed and}} the castle's owner, Lord Hothfield, gave the property to the Office of Works. Work to stabilise the ruins was carried out and the castle, as a listed building and ancient monument, eventually passed into the control of English Heritage as a tourist attraction. There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009. Erosion continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the castle's masonry, and as of 2010 English Heritage considered the castle's condition to be declining, with some parts at particular risk.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Georgia Tech rushing {{attack was}} led by Tashard Choice. Choice was the leading rusher in the ACC, {{averaging}} over 100 yards per game. Against North Carolina State, Choice recorded 164 rushing yards on 34 carries, earning {{what was then a}} single-game career high in rushing yards. In the days before the ACC championship, Choice was named to the second-team All-ACC team, and was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> on offense against Wake Forest.|$|E
50|$|Dog rose <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{invasive}} {{species in the}} high country of New Zealand. It was recognised as displacing native vegetation as early as 1895 although the Department of Conservation does not consider it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conservation <b>threat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fire {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the village. In 1926, {{the original}} horse barn {{attached to the}} Munshaw Hotel burned down. The following year, a fire that started {{in a grocery store}} destroyed an entire block of homes and businesses.|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still had the potential <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat,</b> as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard was {{captured}} in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands {{several times in the}} Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey {{is open to the public}} from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.|$|E

5|$|Selendis is the {{executor}} of the Protoss military {{following the}} reunification of the race. The character is introduced in the novel Twilight and in the Wings of Liberty campaign, where she is played by Cree Summer. Selendis is fiercely loyal to her race's ideals and completely dedicated to her responsibilities. A protégée of Artanis, she considers the dark templar <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to her heritage but is willing to work beside them. Selendis is particularly eager to reclaim Aiur from the Zerg. Shortly after Artanis cleanses Shakuras of Zerg, Selendis takes part in an expedition to rescue three stranded heroes from Aiur; however, the mission was sabotaged by Ulrezaj, who kills two of the trapped warriors. During this time, Selendis became aware of other Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, but as it was not believed possible to save them, their existence is kept secret. Later, Selendis commands the defenses of the dark templar archives on Ehlna against attack by Zerg and Ulrezaj, resulting in Ulrezaj's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a {{supernova}} {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} was that the military establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for {{the overthrow of the}} Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E
25|$|During the Falklands War in 1982, {{eight of}} them <b>were</b> {{deployed}} <b>to</b> Trelew, 670miles (1,080km) from the islands, to avoid congestion on the closer southern airfields. Although within operating range of the British task force, the Canberra <b>was</b> judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> limited <b>threat</b> due <b>to</b> its poor maneuverability compared with the British Sea Harriers.|$|R
50|$|For {{many decades}} the Ash Meadows area has <b>been</b> {{disturbed}} by <b>a</b> number of human activities, including peat mining, construction of roads, real estate development, and agricultural {{practices such as}} plowing, water diversion, and grazing. The pumping of groundwater proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> serious <b>threat,</b> as it lowered the high water table that supports the ecosystem.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} speculated {{that the reason for}} this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while {{fighting}} the Alliance, as he worked very hard to put down his competition, especially WCW.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially there appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> that the Tavera Dam {{along the river}} would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due {{to the time of}} night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, {{as well as their}} law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{maintained}} tolerant {{policies and}} encouraged {{the involvement of}} religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742, along with Muslims. Zahir did not consider Jews <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to his rule and believed that their connections with the Jewish diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance {{in the construction of}} Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area. The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna. Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa-'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule.|$|E
50|$|Fethullah Gülen was at {{one time}} a close ally of the AKP and had several {{supporters}} within the judiciary that helped imprison several army officers which the AKP considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coup <b>threat</b> in 2007, {{through the use of}} the controversial Sledgehammer and Ergenekon trials.

2500|$|Initially, F-102 {{detachments}} began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent <b>to</b> {{bases in}} Southeast Asia in 1962 after radar contacts detected by ground radars <b>were</b> thought <b>to</b> possibly <b>be</b> North Vietnamese Il-28 [...] "Beagle" [...] bombers [...] considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> credible <b>threat</b> {{in that time}} period.
