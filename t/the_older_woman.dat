5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} of H.M.S. Pinafore {{relied on}} stock character types, {{many of which}} were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the cast of House were not established actors, with many having primarily only worked with Obayashi on his commercials and independent films. During the two-year waiting period to start filming House, Obayashi created several commercials and began casting the seven girls from models who were in his commercials. The most experienced members of the main cast were Kimiko Ikegami and Yōko Minamida. Obayashi was friends with Minamida who he filmed in commercials for Calpis. Ikegami was mostly working television and theater {{at the time and}} worried that taking the role of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> would {{have a negative effect on}} the roles she would be subsequently offered, but still agreed to play the part. The country music singer Kiyohiko Ozaki, who plays Mr. Togo in the film, was cast because he was friends with Obayashi through their shared hobby of horseback riding. Other roles were filled by members of the crew and their families; for example, Nobuhiko Obayashi's daughter Chigumi plays the little girl, and the film's production designer plays the shoe maker.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Woman</b> : <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is {{an unnamed}} elderly woman that lives a lonely {{life with her}} dog, Toby. She decides to foster a young girl but gets a young boy named John instead. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is less lonely when she is given good dreams.|$|R
6000|$|Now the Prince was a good-hearted fellow, {{so he said}} to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman,</b> [...] "It {{is little}} I have, but {{such as it is}} you are welcome to it." [...] Thereupon he gave <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>the</b> lump of brown bread and the cold sausage that was in his wallet, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> ate it up at a bite.|$|R

25|$|After his father's death, Propertius' mother set him {{on course}} {{for a public}} career, {{indicating}} his family still had some wealth, while the abundance of obscure mythology present in his poetry indicates he received a good education. Frequent mention of friends like Tullus, the nephew of Lucius Volcatius Tullus, consul in 33 BC, plus {{the fact that he}} lived on Rome's Esquiline Hill indicate he moved among the children of the rich and politically connected during {{the early part of the}} 20s BC. It was during this time that he met Cynthia, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> who would inspire him to express his poetic genius.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 March 1935, Rattenbury was {{discovered}} in his sitting room with severe head injuries. He had sustained a series of blows with a carpenter's mallet, the blows savage enough to remove the back of his skull; he died four days later. His wife confessed, but Stoner admitted to the housekeeper that it was actually he who had carried out the deed. Alma Rattenbury and Stoner were both charged, although Alma was to retract her confession after her elder son Christopher visited her in prison. Stoner was convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment following the submission to the Home Secretary of a petition signed by over 300,000 people who felt that the young man had been manipulated into committing murder by <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman.</b> Alma, represented by Ewen Montagu, was acquitted of murder and of being an accessory after the fact but committed suicide a few days later on 4 June 1935, stabbing herself six times in the breast with a dagger before throwing herself into the River Stour at Christchurch.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "tattling of many tongues" [...] in Virginia's Valentine poem was a {{reference}} to actual incidents. In 1845, Poe had begun a flirtation with Frances Sargent Osgood, a married 34-year-old poet. Virginia {{was aware of the}} friendship and might even have encouraged it. She often invited Osgood to visit them at home, believing that <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> had a [...] "restraining" [...] effect on Poe, who had made a promise to [...] "give up the use of stimulants" [...] and was never drunk in Osgood's presence.|$|E
60|$|He {{was going}} to his work? <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> said, {{quickening}} hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out. On his telling her where he worked, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> became a more singular <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> than before.|$|R
50|$|Fulfilling their greed, Bawang Merah {{followed}} the steps told by Bawang Putih. She willingly drifted her mother's cloth, {{walked along the}} river, asked people and eventually came to the cave where <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> lived. Unlike Bawang Putih, however, Bawang Merah refused <b>the</b> <b>old</b> woman's order to work and she even arrogantly ordered <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> {{to give her the}} larger pumpkin. And so <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> gave it to Bawang Merah.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> wear yellow {{necklaces}} and spiral earrings, unmarried girls wear a beyop, an ornament {{that consists}} of five to six brass plates fixed under their petticoats. Tattooing was popular among <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women.</b>|$|R
500|$|On January 6, {{after the}} Americans had spent {{several days of}} waiting and {{shouting}} basic Huaorani phrases into the jungle, the first Huaorani visitors arrived. [...] A young man and two women emerged on the opposite river bank around 11:15a.m., and soon joined the missionaries at their encampment. The younger of the two women had come against the wishes of her family, and the man, named Nankiwi, who was romantically interested in her, followed. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> (about thirty years old) acted as a self-appointed chaperone. The men gave them several gifts, including a model plane, and the visitors soon relaxed and began conversing freely, apparently not realizing that the men's language skills were weak. Nankiwi, whom the missionaries nicknamed [...] "George", showed interest in their aircraft, so Saint took off with him aboard. They first completed a circuit around the camp, but Nankiwi appeared eager for a second trip, so they flew toward Terminal City. Upon reaching a familiar clearing, Nankiwi recognized his neighbors, and leaning out of the plane, wildly waved and shouted to them. Later that afternoon, the younger woman became restless, and though the missionaries offered their visitors sleeping quarters, Nankiwi and the young woman left the beach with little explanation. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> apparently had more interest in conversing with the missionaries, and remained there most of the night.|$|E
500|$|At the Dunphy house, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) {{decide to}} have a small dinner for Valentine's Day {{in order to avoid}} the {{disastrous}} results of the events of last year. Since they only could get a very early dinner reservation, Claire realizes that all the couples are elderly so she decides to bring back their characters from last year, Clive Bixby and Julianna. Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits on the bed with a bottle of champagne. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> then walks in after coming back from the bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act like themselves.|$|E
500|$|In pre-Code Hollywood, the sex film became {{synonymous with}} women's {{pictures}} — Darryl F. Zanuck once told Wingate {{that he was}} ordered by Warner Brothers' New York corporate office to reserve 20% of the studio's output for [...] "women's pictures, which inevitably means sex pictures." [...] Vice films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored Code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that had gone before. The concept of marriage was often tested in films such as The Prodigal (1931), {{in which a woman}} is {{having an affair with a}} seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film, it is to encourage one son to grant his wife a divorce so she can marry his brother, with whom she is obviously in love. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> proclaims the message of the film in a line near the end: [...] "This the twentieth century. Go out into the world and get what happiness you can." ...|$|E
60|$|Unable to {{understand}} this, Bladud turned again to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman,</b> but, lo! <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> was gone, {{and in her}} place stood Branwen, erect, with the grey shawl thrown back, and a half-timid smile on her face.|$|R
5000|$|The legend {{goes that}} on an autumn night Earl of Shrewsbury was {{returning}} to his home at Alton Towers when an <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> suddenly appeared in the road. The coach stopped to find why she was there, and then <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> begged for a coin. The Earl cruelly dismissed her, so <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> placed a curse on him. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> said, [...] "For every branch on <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Oak Tree here that falls, {{a member of the}} Earl’s family will die." [...] The Earl dismissed this and carried on his way.|$|R
50|$|An <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> took pity on Snow-White-Fire-Red {{and took}} her home. Snow-White-Fire-Red made {{marvelous}} things, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> sold them. One day she told <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> to get her scraps of cloth from the palace, and she dressed two doves that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> owned. <b>The</b> two birds flew to the palace, where everyone admired them, and the doves {{told the story of}} how the prince had won Snow-White-Fire-Red. He remembered and ordered the birds to be followed, and soon he and Snow-White-Fire-Red were married.|$|R
2500|$|Bartolo departs, Susanna returns, and Marcellina and Susanna {{share an}} {{exchange}} of very politely delivered sarcastic insults (duet: [...] – [...] "After you, brilliant madam"). Susanna triumphs in the exchange by congratulating her rival on her impressive age. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> departs in a fury.|$|E
2500|$|Emin's {{works on}} fabric has {{been related to}} other artists such as Louise Bourgeois, who Emin {{actually}} mentions in a sewn work called <b>The</b> <b>Older</b> <b>Woman</b> (2005) with the phrase (monoprint on fabric), [...] "I think my Dad should have gone out with someone older like Louise, Louise Bourgeois". She was interviewed by Alan Yentob during the BBC's Imagine documentary Spiderwoman about Louise Bourgeois, aired in the UK on 13 November 2007.|$|E
2500|$|After Jefferson's death, Sally Hemings was [...] "given her time" [...] by his daughter. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> lived freely {{with her}} two sons in Charlottesville. In the 1830 census, the census taker in Charlottesville {{classified}} all three Hemings as white, showing how others perceived them by appearance because of their overwhelming European ancestry. Sally was of three-quarters white ancestry. Her children were seven-eighths white and thus legally white under the Virginia law of the time. It was not until 1924 that Virginia passed the Racial Integrity Act, which classified anyone as black who had any known African ancestry, under the [...] "one drop rule".|$|E
5000|$|A motorbiker (Stefan Merki), who {{early in}} the film was unable to start his motorcycle, boards a tram in Berlin, and {{witnesses}} a black man (Paul Outlaw) sitting down next to an elderly white woman (Senta Moira). In the entire 12 minutes, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> racially abuses <b>the</b> black man, stating that blacks stink, are unintelligent, criminal and the perfect carrier for AIDS. The biker feels uncomfortable, but does not dare to interrupt. The black man stays quiet for the entire film, until the tram controller arrives: when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> produces her ticket, he grabs and swallows it. When <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> accuses <b>the</b> black man of eating her ticket, he coolly shows his valid ticket to the controller; the latter nods at him and arrests <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>The</b> punch line is that both the black man and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> are [...] "Schwarzfahrer" [...] now: the black man who rides a train, is a non-offensive [...] "black rider", while <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> now is a real law-breaking Schwarzfahrer (i.e. fare dodger). The one passenger the viewer knows who never possessed a ticket, the motorbiker, escapes without the controller checking his ticket.|$|R

50|$|In a {{different}} scene, {{a young girl}} waits for her boyfriend Epigenes to arrive as an <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is out looking for a date. They exchange vulgar insults and go inside their homes as Epigenes enters the scene, lamenting the new laws governing sex. He and the girl both speak of their desire for one another, but are interrupted by <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman.</b> Citing <b>the</b> new law, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> attempts to force Epigenes to sleep with her first. As the young girl and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> fight over <b>the</b> boy, two more <b>old</b> <b>women</b> enter and drag him away against his will.|$|R
50|$|Mina - {{who suffers}} from asthma - gives <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> {{one of her own}} inhalers so that she can breathe again. In thanks for helping her to breathe, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> returns. This time she has brought Mina a chicken, to thank her.|$|R
