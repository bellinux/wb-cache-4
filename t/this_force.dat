5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, 76T {{was part of the}} 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla. During the war, 76T was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations, and shore bombardment missions. She also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian coast. On 24 May 1915, 76T and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the Bombardment of Ancona, with 76T involved in the operation against Ancona itself. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; <b>this</b> <b>force</b> included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was 76T. <b>This</b> <b>force</b> was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.|$|E

Trunajaya also built fortifications along the Brantas (Kediri is on the east bank of this river), and his artillery generally outgunned the loyalists.|$|E

5|$|According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army was a {{relatively}} small fighting force of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers. To aid <b>this</b> <b>force,</b> Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of army reserves in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 AD, while two other reserve units were created in 110 AD; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer). The main purpose of these reserve units was to position Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower Wei River against Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Tibetan tribes.|$|E
5|$|According to the storyline for Ironside, {{ten days}} {{following}} D-Day, Allied forces would {{land in the}} Bordeaux region. <b>This</b> <b>force</b> would spend around twelve days establishing a bridgehead before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called Operation Vendetta).

5|$|After a brief {{engagement}} between Thebes and Phocis, {{in which}} Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge <b>this</b> <b>force.</b> The forces {{met at the}} dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1,100.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Shortwave {{radiative}} forcing of climate by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols {{is estimated to}} be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of greenhouse warming, with a global annual average value of approximately- 1 W m uncertain to - 2 at least a factor of two. Contribution estimates to <b>this</b> <b>forcing</b> by the direct effect are- 0. 4 W m. It is therefore necessary to - 2 accurately and efficiently represent <b>this</b> <b>forcing</b> in climate models, specifically including spatial and temporal variability. Here we explore a method to expedite the process for determining <b>this</b> <b>forcing.</b> The method utilizes an approach where the forcing is computed precisely at several discrete radii (r) and then integrated over an arbitrary aerosol size distribution. Additionally, the forcing is calculated at several values of relative humidity (RH), solar zenith angle (SZA), and aerosol optical thickness (J). The parameters can be interpolated to p...|$|R
5|$|After {{three days}} and nights of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road during the morning of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on <b>this</b> <b>force</b> and called in an air strike. Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm <b>this</b> <b>force</b> is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of <b>this</b> <b>force</b> in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
