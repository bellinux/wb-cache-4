5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani voiced his opposition {{over the fact}} that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used to pay the rent at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar <b>train</b> <b>link</b> to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E

25|$|The village's Victorian and Edwardian {{expansion}} {{was largely}} {{a response to the}} greater commuting opportunities available following the arrival of the railway in the village in 1869. The laying of a railway line through Kilmacolm occurred in order to provide a direct boat <b>train</b> <b>link</b> between Glasgow's St Enoch station and the harbour at Princes Pier in Greenock. The clean air of the parish was hailed as having great health benefits, attracting both visitors and new residents who constructed significant residential properties in the village.|$|E

25|$|The {{town has}} three railway {{stations}} on the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line: Wellington, Oakengates and Telford Central. A new direct train service to London was launched by Wrexham & Shropshire in 2008. The venture however proved unprofitable and ceased {{to operate on}} Friday 28 January 2011, leaving Shropshire as the only English county without a direct <b>train</b> <b>link</b> to London; that is until Virgin Trains launched a direct Shrewsbury to London service in December 2014 In addition, there are two further stations isolated from the national network, Spring Village and Horsehay & Dawley, at Telford Steam Railway, situated at Horsehay.|$|E
25|$|Tamworth {{station is}} {{situated}} on the Main North railway line. Trains no longer continue {{all the way to}} the Queensland border, but the town is still served by the NSW TrainLink Xplorer service between Sydney and Armidale, where daily coaches continue to Tenterfield. Other NSW <b>Train</b> <b>Link</b> coaches operate to Inverell. Until November 2009, Pacific National operated a regular fuel service from Sydney, carrying 30million litres (6,600,000imp gal; 7,900,000US gal) of fuel a year to Tamworth and Dubbo. It was the last freight service to serve the city; in the 1980s, up to six trains a day ran.|$|E
25|$|A RailAir coach {{service is}} run by National Express, {{connecting}} Woking railway station and London Heathrow Airport, {{in the absence of}} a direct <b>train</b> <b>link</b> to Heathrow. The bus services in Woking are mainly operated by Abellio Surrey and Arriva Guildford & West Surrey. Arriva Guildford & West Surrey provide the short-distance to services to the surrounding towns and villages, such as West Byfleet, Byfleet, Camberley, Weybridge and to Guildford. Abellio Surrey provides services to more distant towns including into Greater London. These include Staines, Addlestone and Heathrow T5. The Bustler community transport service, which operates from bases Westfield and St John's, uses a fleet of minibuses to serve people with a transportation disadvantage.|$|E

[...] Corbyn has also said that David Cameron should apologise for the treatment of northern miners during the 1984–5 miners' strike, calling for an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave. Corbyn is in favour of the High Speed 3 <b>train</b> <b>link,</b> arguing that it should be completed before Crossrail 2 in London, as well as greater electrification of the railways.|$|E
2500|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas, potash, kaolin, sodium {{sulphite}} and bentonite contribute {{a great part}} of Regina and area's economy. The completion of the <b>train</b> <b>link</b> between eastern Canada and the then-District of Assiniboia in 1885, the development of the high-yielding and early-maturing Marquis strain of wheat and the opening of new grain markets in the United Kingdom established the first impetus for economic development and substantial population settlement. The farm and agricultural component is still {{a significant part of the}} economy – the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (now Viterra Inc.,), [...] "the world's largest grain-handling co-operative" [...] has its headquarters in Regina — but it is no longer the major driver; provincially it has slipped to eighth overall, well behind the natural resources sectors.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, then {{transport}} minister Seiji Maehara {{proposed a}} bullet <b>train</b> <b>link</b> to Haneda Airport, using an existing spur {{that connects the}} Tōkaidō Shinkansen to a train depot. JR Central called the plan [...] "unrealistic" [...] due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea. The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes {{referred to as a}} bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.|$|E
