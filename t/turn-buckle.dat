The lower extremities were encased in individual long-leg plaster casts, and two turnbuckles wei’e incorporated between them, one, transversely between the thighs, and the other, between the ankle portions of the casts. This created a trapezoid with rigid sides and moval) le horizontal bars. Tile lower extremities thus became functional levers. By opening the upper t. urnbuckle and closing the lower one, a powerful horizontal distracting force could be applied to the pelvis through the medium of the ligaments of the hip joints. Overriding fractures of the ischial and pubic rami, or fractures of the acetabulum with intrapelvic protrusion of the femoral head, could be reduced readily by this method. In the case of a distraction injury of the pelvis, such as a separation of the symphysis pubis, a compression force to effect reduction was applied to the pelvis by closing the upper <b>turn-buckle</b> and opening the lower one. A patient with an overriding unilateral fracture of the pubic and ischial rami was admitted to a station hospital In North Africa, and it was planned to treat the pelvic frac...|$|E
