5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, {{as he did}} {{not explain}} what had happened, and the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo.

5|$|During the Northern Seven Years' War, {{attacks were}} {{launched}} on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was {{published}} in Science, Natures news division published an article stating that some other physicists regarded the result with skepticism. Recently, prominent members of the high pressure research community have criticised <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> results, questioning <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> pressures or <b>the</b> presence of metallic hydrogen at <b>the</b> pressures <b>claimed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Variations of the {{original}} theory were also proposed, including <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that <b>the</b> plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that media consolidation was a core component of <b>the</b> conspiracy, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that <b>the</b> Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing {{the powers of the}} monarch to a mere figurehead, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.|$|R
5|$|He {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of Rod Marsh to the Australian captaincy {{over the}} incumbent, Kim Hughes, {{in the early}} 1980s. The constant campaign against Hughes destabilised his authority. Compounding the situation, the ACB compelled Hughes {{to be interviewed by}} Chappell on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> for 15 September 1942 are {{in serious}} doubt, {{following}} the first detailed {{scrutiny of the}} records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown. Moreover, Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille could not have downed as many aircraft as claimed.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the JWP {{reported}} on <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of discovery of element112 again and officially recognized the GSI team as the discoverers of element 112.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Claim</b> also {{teamed up}} with the poet and ex-Dentists drummer Vic Templar (an alias for Ian Smith) for various evenings which {{combined}} a play, featuring members of <b>The</b> <b>Claim,</b> with a musical performance by the band. Templar also collaborated with <b>The</b> <b>Claim</b> for <b>the</b> song [...] "Mike The Bike", issued as the B-side to perhaps <b>The</b> <b>Claim's</b> most impressive outing, [...] "Birth Of A Teenager", issued as a limited edition single housed in a sleeve designed by the Medway scene's most multi-faceted talent, Billy Childish. For another gig, Welsh band The Manic Street Preachers played their debut London show supporting <b>The</b> <b>Claim.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Claim</b> played their final show in January 1993.|$|R
5000|$|The {{format of}} <b>the</b> {{processes}} <b>claimed</b> in Diamond v. Diehr, Parker v. Flook, and Gottschalk v. Benson illustrate {{the concept and}} its practical application. In Diehr, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was to “a method of operating a rubber-molding press” using the Arrhenius equation, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> contained at least minimal references to the mold press and other apparatus. The Court held <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> patent-eligible. In Flook, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was to a [...] "method for updating the value {{of at least one}} alarm limit," [...] where an “’alarm limit’ was a number.” <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> said nothing about a chemical reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. The Court held <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> patent-ineligible. In Benson, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was to “a data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.” One claim mentioned a reentrant shift register and <b>the</b> other <b>claim</b> mentioned no apparatus at all. The Court held both claims patent-ineligible, however, on the ground that the computer-equipment limitation was too trivial to avoid preempting the idea, since the method could not feasibly be used except with a computer.|$|R

5|$|Mills's {{relationship}} with McCartney triggered considerable media interest. After her divorce, {{the attitude of}} the British media was hostile. Mills frequently accuses the press of misquoting her, and of using material out of context to give a negative impression of her, telling the Evening Standard that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> that she had married McCartney for his money were more hurtful than losing her leg.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1988, the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Council (the {{regional}} legislature) {{issued a}} request to transfer the region from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia.

5|$|The German Federal Archives {{still hold}} records for 109 of Marseille aerial victories.

5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the American scientists suggested the name rutherfordium {{for the new}} element.

5|$|The {{controversy}} only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria {{sent her}} personal physician, Gerhard van Swieten, to investigate <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of vampiric entities.

If, however, the mathematical algorithm is merely presented and solved by <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention, {{as was the case in}} Benson and Flook, and is not applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps, no amount of post-solution activity will render <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> statutory; nor is it saved by a preamble merely reciting the field of use of the mathematical algorithm.|$|R
