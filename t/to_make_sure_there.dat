The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E

However, Urquhart said {{that one of the reasons}} for the game's development problems was due to indecision on Sega's part, particularly in regards to budgeting; he gave an example of one long segment of the game that cost around US$500,000 to produce, which was eventually cut because Sega thought it wasn't a good fit for the game.|$|E

She is shown to be powerful enough at this size to take down a jet. She has a brief fling with fellow team member Hawkeye.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also secured $200 million {{of funding for}} Ottawa's O-Train expansion project after Treasury Board President John Baird reviewed the project <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> were no cost overruns. The money was secured after Ottawa's new council voted on the project. However, in November, Nepean-Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre announced that, despite opposition from most of Ottawa City Council, $35 million of the transit funding was to be diverted for a new Rideau River bridge crossings between the two Ottawa growing suburban communities, Barrhaven and Riverside South. Poilievre had stated that if the city of Ottawa would present a transit plan, a request to the government for new money for public transit projects will be granted. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated that no provincial money {{will be given to}} the bridge project if no rapid transit corridor is included.|$|E
500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} {{protected by the}} Appalachian Mountains to the west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains. However, occasionally cold air can move from the north or northeast, east of the Appalachian Mountains, from Arctic high pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states. Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about [...] in central North Carolina. Still, temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains. The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was [...] on January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still {{higher than the average}} ocean temperature in Maine during July.

500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird {{was eager to}} use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, {{he was proud of}} the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

2500|$|Surrender, {{for those}} games that allow it, {{is usually not}} {{permitted}} against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as [...] "late" [...] surrender. The alternative, [...] "early" [...] surrender, gives player the option to surrender before the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.|$|E

Although officially the linkage between reduction of oil supplies and the radar agreement was not claimed, it was suspected. [...] Transneft denied any connections with radar agreement, saying that reduction was purely commercial as Tatneft and Bashneft started to refine more oil at their own refineries.

2500|$|Maintaining a {{fixed gear}} is {{relatively}} easy because it has fewer parts than a geared bicycle. [...] The sprocket should be checked regularly <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is no damage to any teeth and that no object is grinding it as it turns with the rear wheel. [...] The chainring should be checked similarly for any damage. [...] There is an advantage to selecting a number of chainring teeth {{that is not a}} round multiple of the number of sprocket teeth (e.g. 3) because this avoids coincidence of the same chainring and sprocket teeth, and tyre contact patch, on each of the rider's power strokes. [...] For riders who perform brakeless skid-stops, it is best to select prime-numbered chainrings (e.g. 41, 43 or 47 teeth) to guarantee that rear tyre wear is spread evenly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{threat of}} a RICO {{indictment}} unnerved many at Drexel. [...] A RICO indictment would have required the firm {{to put up a}} performance bond of as much as $1 billion in lieu of having its assets frozen. [...] This provision was put in the law because organized crime had a habit of absconding with the funds of indicted companies, and the writers of RICO wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was something to seize or forfeit {{in the event of a}} guilty verdict. [...] Unfortunately, most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most Wall Street firms (in Drexel's case, 96 percent—by far the most of any firm). [...] This debt would have to take second place to this performance bond. [...] Additionally, if the bond ever had to be paid, Drexel's stockholders would have been all but wiped out. [...] Due to this, banks will not extend credit to a firm under a RICO indictment.|$|E

2500|$|At times, {{production}} designer David Willson has {{to build}} entire sets, or props for sets, from scratch instead of finding an available alternative. For [...] "Witness", David Willson found an abandoned warehouse {{to use for}} the scene where Clark is thrown into a furnace by the three kryptonite-powered thieves. In the warehouse, Willson built a , [...] blast furnace. In [...] "Visitor", David Willson and his production crew built a [...] "practical, functioning" [...] tower for {{the scene in the}} woods where Cyrus attempts to call for his alien transport. Willson's inspiration came while working on Love Field, starring Denzel Washington and Michelle Pfeiffer. While working on the project, Willson met a man named Bowler Simpson, who had built a [...] memorial, to his deceased daughter, out of old license plates and STOP signs. Willson used this image when constructing Cyrus's tower. Even though the tower was physically built, Entity FX still stepped in to create 2-D light beams located on the tower. Willson also likes to add elements to his sets that correlate thematically with the episode, like in [...] "Red", where Clark is exposed to red kryptonite. Here, Willson emphasized the [...] "red theme"; working with director Jeff Woolnough, Willson tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was something red [...] "popping-out" [...] to catch the audiences' attention in each scene. This would include red objects in the foreground and background, as well as red lenses added to the cameras. Going along with the theme of colors in the show, Metropolis was given a [...] "glass and steel and blue wash of color" [...] for the look of the city. The crew found a new building in Vancouver, which was not yet occupied, and turned it into LuthorCorp plaza.
