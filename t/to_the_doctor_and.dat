One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird.

The human crew have no idea how they got there nor where they are, but know they are helping their captain to run a race. The Doctor and his companions, Tegan and Turlough discover that the ship, and several other historical Earth ships, are competing in a solar sail race through the Solar System. The ship's officers reveal themselves to be Eternals, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>and</b> the humans as Ephemerals. The Eternals live in the [...] "trackless wastes of eternity" [...] and rely on Ephemerals for their thoughts and ideas. This race is being run by the Guardians to win Enlightment, the wisdom to know everything.

Listings magazine Radio Times published two letters from viewers regarding City of Death. Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial's cast and the location filming; less impressed, however, was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs. Responding to similar criticisms from viewers, Douglas Adams wrote, [...] "If the programme didn't move and take a few risks then it would have died of boredom years ago". Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4,000 million years ago and the date given in City of Death of 400 million years ago. Graham Williams replied, [...] "The good Doctor makes the odd mistake or two but I think an error of 3,600 million years is pushing it! His next edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica will provide an erratum". Another viewer wrote {{to point out that the}} atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>and</b> his companions; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism, citing artistic license.|$|E

As the Doctor arrived late, Churchill turned to the scientific advances of Professor Edwin Bracewell, including robotic devices called [...] "Ironsides", which are recognised immediately by the Doctor as his archenemies the Daleks. The Doctor tries to understand their purpose in being on Earth at this time, but they continue to act as Bracewell's inventions, ready to serve Britain's war efforts. Angrily, the Doctor attacks the devices, shouting, [...] "I am the Doctor {{and you are the}} Daleks!". Unbeknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>and</b> the humans, a Dalek ship is in orbit near the moon; upon hearing the Doctor's [...] "testimony", the Dalek aboard uses it to activate a [...] "Progenator Device" [...] and alerts its comrades on Earth.

500|$|Simon Pegg {{had grown}} up with Doctor Who and {{considered}} it a [...] "great honour" [...] to guest star. He was pleased at being cast as a bad guy.

[...] Pegg has stated during interviews that he found this an extremely difficult line to say. Voice artist Nicholas Briggs had recorded voice work for the Jagrafess, but his contribution was not used because it sounded too similar to the Nestene Consciousness (which Briggs had voiced in [...] "Rose"). [...] "The Long Game" [...] was produced singularly in the series' fourth production block. Filming in the studio took place in November and December 2004. Some location filming was done in the former BT building in Coryton, Cardiff for five days in December. The Jagrafress was entirely made of computer-generated imagery (CGI), animated by The Mill. It was given a shark-like design, with the intention that it would [...] "snap out" [...] like a shark. The initial design was also described as a [...] "lump of meat on the ceiling".|$|E

500|$|The Doctor has {{prepared}} the house specially {{for the children}} and the holiday; though the children are pleased, Madge privately explains about Reg's death <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>and</b> insists he not overindulge the children. During the first night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits from the planet Androzani Major (Bill Bailey, Paul Bazely, and Arabella Weir). She holds them at gunpoint and is taken back to their excavation walker and told that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around his head like a crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is [...] "weak", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, the crown acting as an interface.|$|E
500|$|Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose as {{companion}} {{at the end}} of [...] "Dalek". However, when he tries to smuggle future knowledge from Satellite Five in the year 200,000 back to his own time in [...] "The Long Game" [...] the Doctor expels him from the TARDIS. The Doctor is angry at Rose after he takes her to the event of father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall)'s death and she saves his life, causing a paradox. However, when Pete dies to restore the timeline he shows compassion and encourages her to sit by his side as he passes away. After encountering Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) (a con artist and former Time Agent from the 51st century) in 1941, the Doctor realises Harkness had caused a deadly nanotechnological plague to sweep through the human race, turning humans into gas-mask zombies. Following the resolution of the situation, Jack prepares to sacrifice himself, but the Doctor saves him and invites him on board the TARDIS. When the Doctor encounters Blon (Annette Badland), the only Slitheen to survive the Downing Street explosion in present-day Cardiff he has doubts over whether or not to send her home to be executed. During this episode the Doctor first notices that he and Rose had kept coming across the words [...] "Bad Wolf". In the episode [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] the Doctor, Rose and Jack find themselves {{at the mercy of the}} Bad Wolf Corporation based on Satellite Five. However, the true enemy is revealed to be the Daleks, the Dalek Emperor having also survived the Time War and had rebuilt the Dalek race. The Doctor sends Rose back to the 21st century to protect her before attempting to destroy the Dalek army. When he realises that doing this would destroy most of planet Earth he is unable to do so, proclaiming he would rather be a coward than a killer. Having absorbed the energies of the time vortex, Rose is able to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>and</b> destroy the Daleks. To save Rose from being killed by harbouring the time vortex, the Doctor removes the harmful effects by kissing her.
