5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> purchase them and display them in their homes. There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution, which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.|$|E
5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, an {{artillery}} gun turret was erected by the United States Army and maintained throughout the war, {{on a high}} dune just off Cotter St. across from the UT campus, and {{is now part of}} the UT properties. It was placed to protect the pass from sightings of German U-boats. Blackouts were called on all the island during nighttime hours, no fires on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> car lights, and house windows could not show light and had to be covered with heavy curtains, blankets or wood.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Eve 1943, a Combined Operations Pilotage Party (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at Luc-sur-Mer. Two {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers, Major Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Ogden-Smith, were landed {{on the beach at}} night in Operation Postage Able and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of January 30/31, but limited information was gathered due to fog and German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|When the spout of a whale was sighted, the {{watchman}} {{alerted the}} men by burning some straw, beating a drum, ringing a bell or waving a flag. Once alerted, men launched small rowing boats from <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>or,</b> if the shoreline was steep, the boats were {{held by a}} capstan and launched by releasing the rope attached to the boats. The whale was struck with a two-flued harpoon (as shown in the seal of Hondarribia, dated 1297), lanced, and killed. A larger boat manned by ten men towed the carcass ashore, waiting for high tide to beach the whale, where it was flensed. The blubber was then brought to a boiling house where it was rendered into oil.|$|E

25|$|The final {{air attack}} mission (code-named Mad Dog Flight) {{comprised}} five B-26s, four {{of which were}} manned by American CIA contract air crews and pilots from the Alabama Air Guard. One FAR Sea Fury (piloted by Douglas Rudd) and two FAR T-33s (piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes) shot down two of these B-26s, killing four American airmen. Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas A4D-2N Skyhawk jets of VA-34 squadron operating from USS Essex, with nationality and other markings removed. Sorties were flown to reassure Brigade soldiers and pilots, and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in acts of war. At 10 am, a tank battle had broken out, with the brigadista holding their line until about 2:00 pm, which led Olvia to order a retreat into Girón. Following the last air attacks, San Román ordered his paratroopers and {{the men of the}} 3rd Battalion to launch a surprise attack, which was initially successful, but soon failed. With the brigadistas in disorganized retreat, the Cuban Army and militiamen started to advance rapidly, taking San Blas and only being stopped outside of Girón at about 11 am. Later that afternoon, San Román heard the rumbling of the advancing T-34s and reported with no more mortar rounds and bazooka rounds, he could not stop the tanks and ordered his men to fall back to the beach. Oliva arrived afterwards to find that the brigadistas were all heading out to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> retreating into the jungle or swamps. Without direct air support, and short of ammunition, Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of considerable onslaught from Cuban government artillery, tanks and infantry.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the Sellafield issue in 2002, noting that while Ireland had no nuclear power plants itself, Belarus {{had been the most}} affected region even though Chernobyl was not in it, and that was [...] "exactly what could happen in Ireland if there was an explosion at Sellafield." [...] In addition, she feared the ongoing low-level emissions from Sellafield: [...] "I started to wonder how safe it was for [...] to play on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> to swim in the sea or even to eat fish." [...] In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, she also viewed the plant as vulnerable to terrorists.|$|E
500|$|The canons were seldom {{used for}} the {{intended}} purpose. However, {{they were used to}} provide gun salute every year {{on the occasion of the}} birthday of Kamehameha III. Another notable daily event at the fort was the beating of the drums at dusk by guards as a signal (a curfew) to the sailors on land to go back to their ships. This practice is recorded in detail by Jones as: [...] "Seamen are obliged to be clear of the beach at drumbeat—eight o'clock in the evening. [...] No person is allowed to remain on shore over night, unless furnished with a proper pass by the captain of the port; and any one found on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> in the town, with no pass, after the proper time, is marched to the calboose, where he is kept in confinement till morning, and then muleted in a pretty round sum for breaking the laws. [...] This is generally paid by the captain, and afterward, with pretty good interest, deducted from Jack's pay." ...|$|E

50|$|In any amphibious operation, {{the defender}} has two options for {{defensive}} strategy: strong defense of <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>or</b> defense in depth. Early {{in the war}} (such as at Tarawa), the Japanese employed strong defenses on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> with little <b>or</b> no manpower in reserve. This tactic proved to be very vulnerable to pre-invasion shore bombardment. Later in the war, at Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, the Japanese switched strategies and dug in their forces in the most defensible terrain.|$|R
500|$|It {{was unknown}} how the remains had settled at the location; the body might either {{have been placed}} at <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> have drifted in the water from another location, some presuming from as far as Canada. The United States Coast Guard entered the {{investigation}} and analyzed the currents {{of the water in}} the area to estimate where the bag containing the remains could have originated from. Dive teams were also used around the time the body was discovered. As of mid-July and August, authorities believed the victim had been placed at the scene, rather than washing onto Deer Island from another location, because the body was not in an advanced enough stage of decomposition. The beach is near a waste-water treatment plant. One of the investigators thought there was a possibility that the disposal had been performed by an employee of the nearby water treatment plant. Since the area has been regarded as a [...] "busy" [...] area for both workers and the public, it was also possible that the person who placed the bag at the scene did so overnight, to avoid being seen.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{commissioned}} an ensign. [...] He {{spent two years}} as a naval aviator in training, first at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida through September 1959, and then at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, during which time {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant, junior grade. He earned a reputation as a party man, as he drove a Corvette, dated an exotic dancer named [...] "Marie the Flame of Florida", spent all his free time on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> in a Bachelor Officer Quarters room turned bar and friendly gambling den, and, as he later said, [...] "generally misused my good health and youth". He began as a sub-par flier: he had limited patience for studying aviation manuals, and spent study time reading history books instead. [...] He was not assigned to the elite units flying fighter aircraft, and instead became a pilot of attack aircraft. [...] During a March 1960 practice run in Texas, he lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. [...] Although momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact, he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam ten feet to the surface, escaping without major injuries. [...] He graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi in May 1960. [...] He joined squadron VA-42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of further training on the Skyraider.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} years of her exile in Algeria, Ranavalona soon {{discovered}} the excitement of the socialite lifestyle among the elite of Algiers. [...] She was regularly invited to parties, outings and cultural events and often hosted events of her own. However, homesickness was ever-present and the impossibility of visiting Madagascar contributed to melancholy and boredom. She would frequently take long walks alone in the countryside, along <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> through the town to clear her mind and lift her spirits. The queen was eager to see mainland France and especially Paris and repeatedly submitted formal requests for permission to travel. These were routinely denied until May 1901 when Ranavalona received the first of many authorizations to visit France. That very month, the queen moved into a small apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Avenue Champs-Élysées and what is now the Place Charles de Gaulle, from which she visited the major sights of the city and was invited to numerous receptions, balls, shows and other events. She was widely received by high society with courtesy and admiration and was offered many gifts including a costly gown. During this first trip, Ranavalona visited the Palace of Versailles, was formally received at the Paris City Hall, and spent three weeks on vacation in Bordeaux. Finally, Ranavalona visited the beaches of Arcachon before exhausting her budget and boarding an Algeria-bound ship at Marseilles in early August. The details of her visit attracted much attention from the Parisian press, which expressed sympathy for the queen's fate and recrimination toward the French government for failing to provide a larger pension or accord her the consideration she deserved as a recipient of the Legion of Honor.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to painting portraits and full-length figurative works, [...] Chase began painting landscapes in earnest {{in the late}} 1880s. His interest in landscape art may have been spawned by the landmark New York exhibit of French impressionist works from Parisian dealer Durand-Ruel in 1886. Chase is best remembered for two series of landscape subjects, both painted in an impressionist manner. The first was his scenes of Prospect and Central Parks in New York; the second were his summer landscapes at Shinnecock. Chase usually featured people prominently in his landscapes. Often he depicted woman and children in leisurely poses, relaxing on a park bench, on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> lying in the summer grass at Shinnecock. The Shinnecock works in particular {{have come to be}} thought of by art historians as particularly fine examples of American Impressionism.|$|E
