The involved uncertainties are the output power of wind and PV generation, the future load growth in <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> period and <b>the</b> evolution of the electricity prices. A Tabu search (TS) based method with an embedded probabilistic power flow analysis is developed in order to solve the DNP optimization problem. The probabilistic power flow problem is solved by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed method is applied to a benchmark system and to a 30 -bus distribution network considering several scenarios to demonstrate the method’s performance and robustness.

The effect of random unidirectional waves on beach morphology is examined {{and the influence of}} wave transmission and choice of sediment and shoreline evolution is also investigated. Little difference is observed in the evolved shoreline between monochromatic and random wave tests. However, a significant difference in morphology occurs below the waterline because of the different wave–current field and accompanying velocity moments. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> shape <b>is</b> also <b>affected</b> by the choice of material for the mobile bed, and wave transmission through the breakwater.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) often entails {{impairments}} {{of executive}} functions, such as planning. Although widely held that these impairments arise from dopaminergic denervation of the striatum, not all executive functions <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> early on, {{and the underlying}} neural dynamics are not fully understood. In a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study, we investigated how planning deficits progress over time {{in the early stages}} of PD compared to matched healthy controls. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify accompanying neural dynamics. METHODS: Seventeen PD patients and 20 healthy controls performed a parametric Tower of London task at two time points separated by ∼ 3 years (baseline and follow-up). We assessed task performance longitudinally in both groups; at follow-up, a subset of participants (14 patients, 19 controls) performed a parallel version of the task during fMRI. We performed meta-analyses to localize regions-of-interest (ROIs), that is, the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior parietal cortex, and caudate nucleus, and performed group-by-task analyses and within-group regression analyses of planning-related neural activation. We studied task-related functional connectivity of seeds in the DLPFC and caudate nucleus. RESULTS: PD patients, compared with controls, showed impaired task performance at both time-points, while both groups showed similar performance reductions from baseline to follow-up. Compared to controls, patients showed lower planning-related brain activation together with decreased functional connectivity. CONCLUSION: These findings support <b>the</b> notion that <b>planning</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> early in <b>the</b> PD disease course, and that this impairment in <b>planning</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by decreases in both task-related brain activity and connectivity.

40|$|Aluminum is a {{versatile}} {{material that is}} used frequently in transportation and packaging, two industries with substantial recent growth. The increase in demand for aluminum, however, has outpaced the growth of primary aluminum production. One way to meet this shortfall {{is the use of}} secondary, or recycled, materials which provides both economic and environmental benefits. The increased use of secondary materials is limited by numerous factors; one such factor of concern is uncertainty. One form of uncertainty that all producers face is consumer demand; this will be the focus of this study. The two stage recourse optimization model presented in this thesis aims to provide batch planners with a tool to effectively manage raw materials in an uncertain demand environment. This model enhances existing research by increasing the number of demand scenarios considered by an increase in the model's resolution. The two metrics evaluated are scrap purchased and production cost. <b>The</b> batch <b>planning</b> process <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> by a number of assumptions about factor inputs including the model resolution, salvage value, coefficient of variation, scrap cost and compositional constraints. Results show that understanding the influence of these factors provides producers with the insight and ability to effectively manage and mitigate the effects of demand uncertainty in a cost minimization framework. by Hashem H.

40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of this study}} is to obtain an optimal time path of crude oil and natural gas {{production}} by controlling the pressure at the bottom of any producing well in Walton Canyon Reservoir. To achieve this goal, the following objectives were obtained: (a) an estimation of the reservoir properties at different levels of the reservoir pressure; (b) an estimation of an optimal time path of joint production using the estimated reservoir properties and the expected prices and costs in the absence and presence of severance, state, and federal income taxes, and depletion of allowances; and (c) an analysis of the changes in the rates of extraction, firms 2 ̆ 7 profits, revenues to local, state, and federal governments, and welfare losses as a result of changes in tax policies. To conduct this study, an optimization model is used to maximize the present value of net revenues of firms producing oil and gas in the reservoir, subject to the available stock of oil in the ground. Cost per unit of time is discussed at three stages of production (naturally flowing, pumping, and secondary recovery or pressure maintenance). Using the assumption that all producing wells in the reservoir are at the pumping stage of production, the conclusion is made that only the operating cost is related to the bottom well-hole flowing pressure. Since the goal is to control the rates of joint production by controlling the bottom well-hole flowing pressure, the operating cost of the whole reservoir is minimized through separable programming. The non-linear cost equation is solved for the values of the bottom well-hole flowing pressure under a competitive condition in the absence of externalities. In order to estimate the optimal rates of oil and gas production, the expected prices are computed using the actual domestic prices of oil, gas, and electricity. The optimal rates of oil and gas production are obtained through dynamic programming which is applied to the optimization model using a 15 percent discount rate. However, discount rates of 10 percent and 20 percent also are used to determine the influences on <b>the</b> optimal production <b>plan,</b> allowing <b>the</b> production period for twenty years. The empirical results indicate that the production of oil and gas from this reservoir will be profitable in the future, using a 15 percent discount rate, prior to imposition of any taxes. The whole recoverable stock of oil by pump will be extracted within three years beginning with a higher production rate in 1998 and ending with a lower production rate in the year 2000. A 10 percent discount rate influenced the net revenue of the whole reservoir but did not change <b>the</b> production <b>plan.</b> However, <b>the</b> optimization model and, in particular, <b>the</b> production <b>plan</b> <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by <b>the</b> 20 percent discount rate. In other words, the joint production is profitable in the early years, using a 20 percent discount rate, beginning with a higher production rate in 1982 and ending with a lower production rate in 1985. The important conclusion is that imposing various taxes and depletion allowances, while using a 15 percent discount rate, did not change the optimal time path of production from that time path, which was obtained in the absence of taxation using the same discount rate. The presence of taxation, however, affected revenues and, thereby, resulted in welfare changes in the producing firms and local, state, and federal governments...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{changing}} spatial politics and the changing ideas of "right to the city", I look in particular at how different ideologies {{have been used in}} different historical periods in <b>planning</b> <b>the</b> city, as well as the practices that led to spatial change. Using Henri Lefebvre's theory of the "right to the city", I suggest three dimensions in observing the right to the city, namely, the right to settle, the right to be different from the "modem city", and the right to keep the structure of meaning with regards to daily life and local space. By examining historical materials and using field work data, I show how "the right to the city" was ignored by the central and local governments during <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> process. I point out that the state always acts as the main factor that shapes the space of the city. <b>The</b> urban <b>planning</b> process <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> by <b>the</b> change of spatial politics, the politics of heritage, and the production of space from the state. Despite this, residents' daily lives help to shape the structure of meaning between their lives and their local space. Thus, the local residents have been able to find their own space in the city. Quanzhou is a medium-size ancient city in Fujian, and as with other old cities in China today, its urban space became the arena of negotiation between different local and global social forces and the state. There is also great deal of politics and ambiguity around the concepts of "cultural heritage", and "modernization". This research studies the changing spatial politics from the traditional to the modem state, and the factors that affect the form of space in Quanzhou's different historical stages. The central questions are: how have spatial politics led to the changes of local culture; in what ways have the local residents had their own right to the city and how have they reacted to the state's spatial politics?罗攀.

40|$|This thesis studies a {{maritime}} transportation {{problem for}} service vessels {{used in the}} Norwegian aquaculture industry. We create an optimization model which {{try to find the}} most efficient fleet size and mix and associated routes in order to meet a specific demand for maintenance. A simulation model is used to evaluate if the routes are realistic. The system which is modelled consists of several types of maintenance operations which are common in today's aquaculture industry. These are delousing, cleaning operations, handling of moorings, inspections, change of nets and transfer of personnel. The jobs are typically performed by three different vessel types, 15 m catamarans, 25 m catamarans or 40 m monohulls. In addition to today's industry, the thesis discusses possible future scenarios for service vessels which are handling of waste, sea grass farming and tourism. The need for better production environment and increased production area have caused fish farmers to move their facilities towards more exposed locations. In order {{to reduce the risk of}} delays and increase the operational window for maintenance operations, vessels with better seakeeping abilities are necessary. Such vessels involve increased investment and operational costs. More advanced vessels increases the demand for more efficient routing. Performing jobs in a suboptimal order will lead to unnecessary costs regarding fuel consumption, salary for crew members and dead time. Furthermore, varying weather conditions increases the need for better planning in order to avoid aborting operations. By investigating how the likelihood of vessels not being able to perform their jobs varies with different weather scenarios, we see how <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> process <b>is</b> <b>affected.</b> <b>The</b> thesis uses a route generation algorithm combined with a set partitioning model to solve the optimization problem and find optimal fleets and routes for the given scenario. The route generation algorithm finds all possible routes based on constraints regarding vessel type and time windows. The possibility of implementing different weather scenarios is also included. The weather is based on wave data from a buoy placed outside of Frøya in Sør-Trøndelag. Different weather scenarios are created by the use of Markov chain simulations. The weather conditions varies between 10 states representing different significant wave heights. The simulation model evaluates how the routes suggested by the optimization model perform when different weather scenarios are generated. The model created is generic. The vessels used, routes travelled and jobs performed are all defined from an excel sheet which is used as input to the simulation model. By studying results from the simulation model we see how each route performs and how many jobs are executed within their time windows. The simulation model is run with both calm and rough weather. By including rough weather, the robustness which is defined as number of jobs performed within their given time windows, decreases by 18 % compared to the simulation with calm weather. We test three different approaches which could increase the robustness of the optimization model. These are: - Including weather constraints in the route generation algorithm. - Setting a limit regarding how many jobs are allowed on each route. - Including slack in the route generation algorithm. The two methods showing most promising results are maximum number of jobs per route and slack. Implementing the methods separately lead to an increase in robustness by 7 % and 3 %, respectively. The cost increases are only 1 % and 2 %, respectively. By combining the two constraints we are able to increase the performance by 8 % compared to not including any constraints. However, we see that even with these additional constraints included some of the routes are quite exposed to delays and additional actions might be necessary. Further work regarding this topic should be directed towards better modelling of the real life scenarios. In order for the method to be more attractive to the industry, the algorithms used need to be more effective in order to be able to solve larger problem instances. In addition, the models need to represent the daily operations of the vessels in a more realistic way...|$|R
