In traditional music, Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals, with prominence given to tamburica music and bećarac, a form of traditional song, recognized as an intangible {{cultural heritage}} by UNESCO. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences—a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia's winemaking areas, with Ilok and Kutjevo recognized as centres of wine production.|$|E

25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal <b>through</b> <b>art</b> their understanding {{of what it means to}} be human.|$|E
25|$|The {{artist has}} broken down the picture plane into facets, {{presenting}} multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would soon {{find its way into}} the foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction <b>through</b> <b>art</b> dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen.

25|$|The {{main focus}} of {{collecting}} among Basel museums is the fine arts – painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity {{up to the present}} and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public {{over the past two decades}} in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city’s well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors – such as <b>through</b> <b>Art</b> Basel.|$|E

40|$|Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) have revolutionised {{reproductive}} medicine; however, reports {{assessing the}} effects of ARTs have raised concerns about the immediate and long-term health outcomes of the children conceived <b>through</b> <b>ARTs.</b> ARTs include manipulations during the periconceptional period, which coincides with an environmentally sensitive period of gamete/embryo development and as such may alter cardiovascular development and health of the offspring in postnatal life. In order to identify the association between ARTs and cardiovascular health outcomes, {{it is important to}} understand the events that occur during the periconceptional period and how they are affected by procedures involved in ARTs. This review will highlight the emerging evidence implicating adverse cardiovascular outcomes before and after birth in offspring conceived <b>through</b> <b>ARTs</b> in both human and animal studies. In addition, it will identify the potential underlying causes and molecular mechanisms responsible for the congenital and adult cardiovascular dysfunctions in offspring whom were conceived <b>through</b> <b>ARTs.</b> Monalisa Padhee, Song Zhang, Shervi Lie, Kimberley C.

25|$|William Bouguereau {{chooses to}} portray the {{characters}} of Cupid and Psyche as young children, almost babies. Cupid, the Roman interpretation of Eros, is often portrayed as a fantastic, mischievous winged baby with a bow and arrow. Eros, the Greek equivalent, is often depicted as a young man, which is when the love affair between him and Psyche plays out. Instead, we see Cupid as a baby, Psyche is also portrayed as a young child, though typically <b>through</b> <b>art</b> history she {{is seen as a}} young woman. Bouguereau chooses to paint her with butterfly wings, for psyche was the Greek word given to butterflies by Aristotle. Psyche is a symbol to the transformation of the human soul, as she transforms from human to immortal. The decision to paint the characters as children is a reference to their innocence, before the corruption of their affair by Venus. This depiction would have been widely accepted in the Salon it was shown at. Bouguereau applied this story in multiple paintings of his, depicting them as the young lovers we are more familiar with.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle of individuality {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear <b>through</b> <b>art</b> as the power of nature in man.|$|E
