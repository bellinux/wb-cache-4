25|$|While Cup drivers attract fans to {{the lower}} tier series, many fans are <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{dominance}} of the senior circuit competitors over their junior league competitors, with Cup drivers often winning {{over half of the}} races in a season. Comparisons have been drawn to a top-tier Major League Baseball player competing against minor-leaguers, or adults competing against children. Some drivers, including Dale Earnhardt, Jr., have also been critical of the dominance of Cup competitors. Many fans, as well as longtime series regular Kenny Wallace, also note the increased focus given to Cup drivers during the broadcast and promotion of the races. This changed beginning in 2012, when NASCAR produced several commercials promoting up-and-coming series regulars.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{are divided}} over the game's {{difficulty}} level and target audience. Some found the game {{too easy for}} adult players. Nintendo World Report's Lasse Pallesen stated Over the Hedge is not engaging to adults or children due to [...] "the repetitive collect-a-thon nature {{of the game and}} the one-dimensional gameplay". GameZone's Louis Bedigian had similar reservations, [...] "Players young and old will be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of excitement". Other reviewers felt the game was suitable for children and adults. Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith stated [...] "It's not just for kids.

GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R.

I'd done a lot of them already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> science fiction aspect of the story. The script for Hard Target was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for Hard Target appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E
