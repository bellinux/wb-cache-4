30|$|Despite {{extensive}} literature demonstrating relatively poor {{outcomes for}} admissions to hospital at <b>the</b> <b>weekend,</b> and despite various suggestions as to why <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect exists, {{there is a}} lack of literature explaining the weekend effect (Webb 2011; Bray and Steventon 2016). The answer why <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect exists, remains unclear. Previous studies of <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect focus on whether or not <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect exists, and propose various possible explanations for <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect without investigating them. In particular, two possible explanations have been discussed: does <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect reflect <b>the</b> characteristics of the admitted patients, the health care provided, or both? Existing studies state the possibility that patients admitted on weekends are more critically ill than those admitted on weekdays. The classical studies of <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect are based on administrative data, which contain limited information on illness severity. A limited number of studies use clinical data. They found that patients admitted on weekends were sicker than those admitted on weekdays. However, after adjusting for proxies for illness severity, they show that <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> effect does indeed exist; indicating that the higher mortality for patients admitted on weekends was independent of changes in illness severity (Biering et al. 2016; Duvald et al. 2018).|$|R

5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am.
