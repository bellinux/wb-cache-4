The exact nature and capacity of nuclear shells differs {{from those of}} electrons in atomic orbitals, primarily because the potential well in which the nucleons move (especially in larger nuclei) {{is quite different from}} the central electromagnetic potential well which binds electrons in atoms. Some resemblance to atomic orbital models may be seen in a small atomic nucleus like that of helium-4, in which the two protons and two neutrons separately occupy 1s orbitals analogous to the 1s orbital for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the helium atom, and achieve unusual stability for the same reason. Nuclei with 5 nucleons are all extremely unstable and short-lived, yet, helium-3, with 3 nucleons, is very stable even with lack of a closed 1s orbital shell. Another nucleus with 3 nucleons, the triton hydrogen-3 is unstable and will decay into helium-3 when isolated. Weak nuclear stability with 2 nucleons {NP} in the 1s orbital is found in the deuteron hydrogen-2, with only one nucleon in each of the proton and neutron potential wells. While each nucleon is a fermion, the {NP} deuteron is a boson and thus does not follow Pauli Exclusion for close packing within shells. Lithium-6 with 6 nucleons is highly stable without a closed second 1p shell orbital. For light nuclei with total nucleon numbers 1 to 6 only those with 5 do not show some evidence of stability. Observations of beta-stability of light nuclei outside closed shells indicate that nuclear stability is much more complex than simple closure of shell orbitals with magic numbers of protons and neutrons.|$|E

50|$|In molecules, the {{situation}} becomes more complex, as each molecule {{has a different}} orbital structure. The molecular orbitals are labelled according to their symmetry, rather than the atomic orbital labels used for atoms and monatomic ions: hence, the electron configuration of the dioxygen molecule, O, is written 1σ 1σ 2σ 2σ 3σ 1π 1π, or equivalently 1σ 1σ 2σ 2σ 1π 3σ 1π. The term 1π represents <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the two degenerate π*-orbitals (antibonding). From Hund's rules, these electrons have parallel spins in the ground state, and so dioxygen has a net magnetic moment (it is paramagnetic).

This electron cloud expansion effect may occur for one (or both) of two reasons. One is that the effective positive charge on the metal has decreased. Because the positive charge of the metal is reduced by any negative charge on the ligands, the d-orbitals can expand slightly. The second is the act of overlapping with ligand orbitals and forming covalent bonds increases orbital size, because the resulting molecular orbital is formed from two atomic orbitals.|$|E
