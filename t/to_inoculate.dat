5|$|During World War II, Burnet's {{research}} {{moved to}} influenza and scrub typhus. With {{the outbreak of}} war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the institute. Fearing {{a repeat of the}} massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later <b>to</b> <b>inoculate</b> all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{isolates}} of pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus, DPD 1 and NY, {{which both}} infect pea (Pisum sativum) systemically, {{differ in their}} ability to move long distance inChenopodium quinoa. DPD 1 spreads to uninoculated leaves, whereas NY is restricted <b>to</b> the <b>inoculated</b> leaves. The NY isolate was found to move from cell to cell infecting all parts of the inoculated leaves, including the petiole. The coat protein (CP) coding region was identified as the determinant of long-distance movement. Virus chimeras containing the CP coding sequence of NY were restricted <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> leaves, whereas chimeras containing the CP coding sequence of DPD 1 infectedC. quinoasystemically. Mutational analysis of the CP demonstrated that changing the serine at position 47 of the NY CP to proline was sufficient to permit systemic spread of the NY(S 47 P) mutant. The reverse mutant, DPD 1 (P 47 S), in which the proline at position 47 of the CP was changed to serine, was restricted <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> leaves. The movement characteristics and CP sequences of 10 additional PSbMV isolates were determined. All isolates caused systemic infection in pea. InC. quinoa 6 of the isolates that were restricted <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> leaves had a serine at position 47. Two isolates that infectedC. quinoasystemically had a proline at position 47. Two isolates, S 6 and NEP- 1, infectedC. quinoasystemically, but had a serine at position 47 of the CP. This shows that although a proline/serine difference at position 47 of the CP determined systemic spread of the isolates DPD 1 and NY, this amino acid alone does not govern the spread of PSbMV inC. quinoa...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{rhesus monkey}} (Macaca mulatta) {{was the first}} {{laboratory}} animal found to be suitable for experimental work with the virus of yellow fever (1, 2), the laboratory mouse has also played an important rble in yellow fever research. However, efforts to define more exactly the susceptibility of this animal have been few since the initial demonstration in 1930 that mice could be infected (3) and certain supplementary studies (4, 5) reported shortly thereafter. Basically, these early studies demonstrated the following: that adult mice are highly susceptible <b>to</b> virus <b>inoculated</b> by the intracerebral route (3, 5) but can be infected regularly by extraneural routes only after the brain has been traumatized (4); that baby mice, in contrast, are highly susceptible <b>to</b> virus <b>inoculated</b> extraneurally (3); and that mice of several different strains are not equally susceptible (4, 5).

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is <b>to</b> <b>inoculate</b> soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|The Haskalah {{was always}} a minor force, but the Jewish {{national}} movements which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic yeshivas (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at Nowy Wiśnicz by Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (I) in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the Misnagdim <b>to</b> <b>inoculate</b> their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis. One of the most contentious issues in this respect was Zionism; the Ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it, while Hungarian and Galician courts reviled it.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{taking into}} account the search for more {{conservative}} agricultural systems, inoculation with A. brasilense stands as a promising strategy to contribute to increased sustainability. However, in times when more and more pesticides for seed treatment are released, and so little is known about their toxicity <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> Azospirillum bacteria, compatibility with inoculants applied to the seed can seriously limit microbial contribution. In our study we have identified alternative methods of inoculation to avoid the contact of Azospirillum with pesticides applied to the seeds, with an emphasis on leaf spray {{at the beginning of the}} vegetative phase. Alternative methods of inoculation may increase the utilization of such bacteria in the field and help reduce agricultural costs.|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody solution hybridization (MASH) assay {{was developed to}} detect fecal excretion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The assay used a biotinylated cDNA probe to detect viral RNA target sequences by hybridization in solution, capture of hybrids on the solid phase with antibiotin antibody, and immunoassay with an enzyme-labelled {{monoclonal antibody}} specific for DNA-RNA hybrids. The MASH assay was used to monitor {{the time course of}} enterotropic MHV excretion after oronasal inoculation. Infectivity of the inoculated mice was simultaneously monitored with sentinel animals. The MASH assay detected MHV excretion in all inoculated mice, with the highest mean excretion levels occurring from day 3 through day 9 postinoculation. Mean excretion then decreased gradually to below detection limits by day 21 postinoculation. Sentinels became infected on exposure <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> mice up <b>to</b> but not after day 21 postinoculation. Infected sentinel mice showed a time course of virus excretion similar <b>to</b> that of <b>inoculated</b> mice. These results indicate that the MASH assay is useful for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of MHV in clinical specimens from laboratory mice...|$|R
40|$|Periodontal disease {{promotes}} atherosclerosis via {{a poorly}} defined mechanism. Our laboratory has previously shown that caspase- 1, responsible for activating IL- 1 beta, {{is important in}} this process. We hypothesized that Porphyromonas gingivalis infection requires activated IL- 1 beta to promote atherosclerosis. Six-week old IL- 1 beta-/- apoE-/- mice of both genders received 15 oral inoculations of P. gingivalis. Detection of anti-P. gingivalis antibodies in serum of inoculated mice confirmed successful infection. Unexpectedly, atherosclerosis at age 17 weeks showed no effect of infection on IL- 1 beta+/+ mice. Moreover, contrary <b>to</b> our hypothesis, <b>inoculated</b> IL- 1 beta-/- females showed increased rather than decreased atherosclerosis compared <b>to</b> <b>inoculated</b> IL- 1 beta+/+ and non-inoculated IL- 1 beta-/-. Thus, either IL- 1 beta does not playa role in atherosclerosis development following P. gingivalis infection or there is a compensatory mechanism. IL- 1 beta deficiency may stimulate another pathway to promote P. gingivalis-induced atherosclerosis. Elucidation of the pathway by which P. gingivalis infection contributes to atherosclerosis development could reveal novel targets for therapy to impede disease progression...|$|R
25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} herd immunity. For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary <b>to</b> <b>inoculate</b> 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{the disease was}} seen as similar to smallpox, due to its {{analogous}} symptoms. The personal physician of the Pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the slaughter of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly {{in the first part}} of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (something which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>inoculate</b> animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution: In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the cattle population. The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases. Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents, and were the first to recognize maternally derived immunity.|$|E
