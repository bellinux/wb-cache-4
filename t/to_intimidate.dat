5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, {{is the idea of}} atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the Soviet Union {{in the early stages of}} the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of disruptive camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used up to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the enemy.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England {{in the newly}} {{completed}} Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, {{the first of the}} many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|At first, St. Leger tried <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians {{in their}} war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E

5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|During {{the parade}} {{for the new}} {{governor}} of Judea, Valerius Gratus, loose tiles fall {{from the roof of}} Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.|$|E
5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

He also promoted a 2003 ban (Proposition M: Aggressive Solicitation Ban) on aggressive panhandling which included a ban for panhandling on public transportation and near ATMs. It also prohibited repeatedly soliciting money, blocking the way, touching or following a person while soliciting, or intentionally trying <b>to</b> <b>intimidate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E

Coverage of Mrs. Obama ran {{the gamut from}} fawning to favorable to strong <b>to</b> angry <b>to</b> <b>intimidating</b> and unpatriotic. First Lady Michelle Obama told Gayle King on CBS This Morning {{that she has been}} caricatured as an [...] "angry black woman"—and that she hopes America will one day learn more about her. [...] "That's been an image that people have tried to paint of me since, you know, the day Barack announced, that I'm some angry black woman", Mrs. Obama said.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} institutions of Augustus was {{the establishment of the}} Praetorian Guard in 27BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They had the power <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Castra Praetoria.|$|E
5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it can either {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> it into running.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{was well}} {{established}} in the Scotland set-up, winning three under-23 caps, before he made his debut for Scotland in a 0–0 draw with Spain at Hampden Park. He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in the Group, which {{was not enough to}} qualify. He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received a black eye from Pelé's elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how he had failed <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.|$|E

5|$|During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the Royal Air Force {{deployed}} Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei {{to provide}} support for British ground forces; Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets <b>to</b> <b>intimidate</b> and pin down rebels. In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle. In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.|$|E

During the Sino-French War of 1884–85 the ship was in Huế in early September 1884, but she carried Admiral Amédée Courbet to Keelung, Taiwan on 23 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, while Tecumseh was traveling, Harrison was {{authorized}} by Secretary of War William Eustis to march against the nascent confederation {{as a show}} of force.

Instead, the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on November 7, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at Prophetstown, next to the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers. Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.|$|E
