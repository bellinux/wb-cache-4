Within its framework, this article aims to distribute surfaces (tables) interacting mainly with <b>tangible</b> <b>objects.</b> Leads for interactive surface distribution such as interactive tables are given. The article proposes to describe some <b>tangible</b> <b>objects,</b> which are the interaction supports; these are called Tangigets. They are defined according to an augmented Presentation-Abstraction-Control structure to take the tangibility element into account. Six categories of Tangigets are also proposed, which are <b>tangible</b> <b>objects,</b> and the supports of distributed collaboration. To validate the Tangiget concept and its use on the TangiSense tabletop, illustrations in centralized and distributed configurations are proposed. A first evaluation is also presented. To conclude, the article presents the directions under consideration for our future research...|$|R

60|$|We can {{now give}} a {{statement}} of the experienced facts concerning the blue spectacles, which will supply an interpretation of common-sense beliefs without assuming anything beyond the existence of sensible objects at the times when they are sensible. By experience of the correlation of touch and sight sensations, we become able to associate a certain place in touch-space with a certain corresponding place in sight-space. Sometimes, namely {{in the case of}} transparent things, we find that there is a <b>tangible</b> <b>object</b> in a touch-place without there being any visible object in the corresponding sight-place. But in such a case as that of the blue spectacles, we find that whatever object is visible beyond the empty sight-place in the same line of sight has a different colour from what it has when there is no <b>tangible</b> <b>object</b> in the intervening touch-place; and as we move the <b>tangible</b> <b>object</b> in touch-space, the blue patch moves in sight-space. If now we find a blue patch moving in this way in sight-space, when we have no sensible experience of an intervening <b>tangible</b> <b>object,</b> we nevertheless infer that, if we put our hand at a certain place in touch-space, we should experience a certain touch-sensation. If we are to avoid non-sensible objects, this must be taken as the whole of our meaning when we say that the blue spectacles are in a certain place, though we have not touched them, and have only seen other things rendered blue by their interposition.|$|E

To evaluate the feasibility of such multimedia prior to actual research, a prototype named TangiLearn has been developed for a case study.

60|$|The {{resort to}} {{corporal}} punishment {{in the training}} of children seems to be spoken of in many passages contained in the Scriptures as of fundamental necessity. But {{there can be no}} doubt that the word rod, as used in those passages, is used simply as the emblem of parental authority. This is in accordance with the ordinary custom of Hebrew writers in those days, and with the idiom of their language, by which a single visible or <b>tangible</b> <b>object</b> was employed as the representative or expression of a general idea--as, for example, the sword is used as the emblem of magisterial authority, and the sun and the rain, which are spoken of as being sent with their genial and fertilizing power upon the evil and the good, denote not specially and exclusively those agencies, but all the beneficent influences of nature which they are employed to represent. The injunctions, therefore, of Solomon in respect to the use of the rod are undoubtedly to be understood as simply enjoining upon parents the necessity of bringing up their children in complete subjection to their authority. No one can imagine that he could wish the rod to be used when complete subjection to the parental authority could be secured by more gentle means. And how this is to be done it is the object precisely of this book to show.|$|E
60|$|WHEN Henry James {{wrote the}} reminiscences {{of his youth}} he shewed conclusively, what indeed could be {{doubtful}} to none who knew him, {{that it would be}} impossible for anyone else to write his life. His life was no mere succession of facts, such as could be compiled and recorded by another hand; it was a densely knit cluster of emotions and memories, each one steeped in lights and colours thrown out by the rest, the whole making up a picture that no one but himself could dream of undertaking to paint. Strictly speaking this may be true of every human being; but in most lives experience is taken as it comes and left to rest in the memory where it happens to fall. Henry James never took anything as it came; the thing that happened to him was merely the point of departure for a deliberate, and as time went on a more and more masterly, creative energy, which could never leave a sight or sound of any kind until it had been looked at and listened to with absorbed attention, pondered in thought, linked with its associations, and which did not spend itself until the remembrance had been crystallised in expression, so that it could then be appropriated like a <b>tangible</b> <b>object.</b> To recall his habit of talk is to become aware that he never ceased creating his life in this way as it was lived; he was always engaged in the poetic fashioning of experience, turning his share of impressions into rounded and lasting images. From the beginning this had been his only method of dealing with existence, and in later years it even meant a tax upon his strength with which he had consciously to reckon. Not long before his death he confessed that at last he found himself too much exhausted for the 'wear and tear of discrimination'; and the phrase indicates the strain upon him of the mere act of living. Looked at from without his life was uneventful enough, the even career of a man of letters, singularly fortunate in all his circumstances. Within, it was a cycle of vivid and incessant adventure, known only to himself except in so far as he himself put it into words. So much of it as he left unexpressed is lost, therefore, like a novel that he might have written, but of which there can now be no question, since its only possible writer is gone.|$|E

40|$|Recently more {{researches}} on <b>tangible</b> <b>objects</b> {{have been}} conducted that enhance the intuitive polygonal or surface modelling of designers in digital and physical worlds. However, a few researches have been done that augment the digital solid modelling with <b>tangible</b> <b>objects.</b> In this paper, we present the Augmented Solid Modeller (ASoM) which helps designers create more complex shapes {{by a combination of}} Boolean operations between a different type of 3 D-printed <b>tangible</b> <b>objects,</b> which is different from the conventional single shape type bottom-up modelling approaches. When multiple objects intersect each other at a given position and angle, the interference or removed shape is often unexpected for designers. Also, as 3 D-printed objects are used for designers only to configure and discuss the shape of final digital 3 D model in existing CAAD, ASoM changes the role of 3 D-printed objects from the replicas to reusable tools for other modelling opportunities. We offered ASoM to students majoring or interested in CAAD and interviewed them to get comments. Since the speed and precision of 3 D-printing will achieve immediate improvement, ASoM is a pioneer in developing cutting-edge approach for designers to model both in digital and physical worlds...|$|R
