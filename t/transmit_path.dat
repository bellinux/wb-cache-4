50|$|The XGMII Extender is {{transparent}} to the Reconciliation Sublayer and PHY device, {{and operates}} symmetrically with similar functions on the DTE transmit and receive data paths. The XGMII Extender is logically {{composed of two}} XGXSs interconnected with a XAUI data path in each direction. One XGXS acts as the source to the XAUI data path in the DTE <b>transmit</b> <b>path</b> and as the destination in the receive path. The other XGXS is the destination in the <b>transmit</b> <b>path</b> and source in the receive path. Each XAUI data path is composed of four serial lanes. All specifications for the XGMII Extender are written assuming conversion from XGMII to XAUI and back to XGMII, but other techniques may be employed provided that {{the result is that}} the XGMII Extender operates as if all specified conversions had been made. One example of this is the use of the optional XAUI with the 10GBASE-LX4 8b/10b PHY, where the XGXS interfacing to the Reconciliation Sublayer provides the PCS and PMA functionality required by the PHY. An XGXS layer is not required at the PHY end of the XAUI in this case. However, means may still be required to remove jitter introduced on the XAUI in order to meet PHY jitter requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{reduction}} is accomplished {{in a few}} ways. In 100 Mbit/s, 1 gigabit and 10 Gbit/s speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical layer transmitters on all the time. If they could be put into [...] "sleep" [...] mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved. When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link signaling integrity. When there is data to transmit, a normal IDLE signal is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link {{is considered to be}} always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the <b>transmit</b> <b>path</b> is in sleep mode.|$|E
