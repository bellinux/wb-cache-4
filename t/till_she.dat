It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with young girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage <b>till</b> <b>she</b> attained puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck <b>till</b> <b>she</b> totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

25|$|Koraaga was a Castle class steel-hulled trawler {{built in}} 1914 by Smiths Dock Company, South Bank, Middlesbrough. She was requisitioned as an {{auxiliary}} minesweeper {{operated by the}} Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in October 1917 for minesweeping duties during World War I, but she was never commissioned. Koraaga returned to be operated commercially as a fishing trawler until she wrecked when she struck a reef off Bass Point whilst carrying returning to Sydney.

The next day Spitfire captured Deux Frères, which had only four of her 14 guns mounted, the rest being stored in her hold. She nevertheless put up a fight and did not surrender <b>till</b> <b>she</b> had lost her captain, H. Trebon, and her third officer killed. and four men wounded out of her crew of 55.

Confusion and disarray reigned on the deck of Chesapeake; Captain Lawrence tried rallying a party to board Shannon, but the bugler failed to sound the call. At this point a shot from a sniper mortally wounded Lawrence; as his men carried him below, he gave his last order: [...] "Don't give up the ship. Fight her <b>till</b> <b>she</b> sinks." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{have found the}} {{character}} of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo. Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising [...] "queer theory" [...] in Queering the Renaissance, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish [...] "To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / <b>Till</b> <b>she</b> had laid it and conjured it down." [...] Romeo's homoeroticism {{can also be found}} in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.|$|E
500|$|... "Start Over" [...] earned mixed to {{positive}} reviews from critics, {{some of whom}} felt it was too similar to Knowles's older material. [...] MTV's Jenna Hally Rubenstein wrote that in the song, Knowles shows her best side, which according to her were the [...] "larger-than-life, emotionally tortured, breathy ballads." [...] Writing for MTV UK, Joanne Dorken concluded that the song was [...] "stonking and dramatic" [...] but also [...] "single-worthy." [...] Dorken added: [...] "Knowles shows off that big voice of hers, leaving us wanting more from the lady herself." [...] While reviewing 4, Gary Graff of Billboard magazine noted that several songs on the album, including [...] "Start Over", were talking about [...] "the gray areas in between". Erika Ramirez of the same magazine said: [...] "Again honest {{when it comes to}} love, Bey' won't surrender <b>till</b> <b>she</b> and beau 'give love another life.' Bey's roar matches the song's fight." [...] Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Start Over" [...] was the first indication that Knowles might have picked [...] "some leftfield influences during those nine months off", making reference to the way the song starts, as he wrote, [...] "with what sounds like – but most probably isn't – distorted pan pipes before kicking into a massive R number." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill {{has been}} {{credited}} with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it {{and in part because}} Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt [...] "responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion". Climber John Long explains that Hill [...] "was a prodigy and everyone knew as much... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, <b>till</b> <b>she</b> free climbed the Nose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{connection}} to Blake's later mythology {{is found in}} The Vales of Har, which are mentioned in The Book of Thel (1789). It is in the Vales where lives Thel herself, and throughout the poem they are represented {{as a place of}} purity and innocence; [...] "I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers" [...] (3:18). At the end of the poem, when Thel is shown the world of experience outside the Vales, she panics and flees back to the safety of her home; [...] "The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek./Fled back unhinderd <b>till</b> <b>she</b> came into the vales of Har" [...] (6:21-22).|$|E
