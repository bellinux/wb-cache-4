40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating</b> in the thermal balance of interstellar clouds, we develop {{an extension of the}} log-Poisson intermittency model to supersonic turbulence. The model depends on a parameter, d, interpreted as the dimension of the most dissipative structures. By comparing the model with the probability distribution of the turbulent dissipation rate in a simulation of supersonic and super-Alfvénic turbulence, we find a best-fit value of d = 1. 6. We apply this intermittency model to the computation of the mass-weighted probability distribution of the gas temperature of molecular clouds, high-mass star-forming cores, and cold diffuse HI clouds. Our main results are: i) The mean gas temperature in molecular clouds can be explained as the effect of <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating</b> alone, while cosmic ray heating may dominate only in regions where the <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating</b> is low; ii) The mean gas temperature in high-mass star-forming cores may be completely controlled by <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating,</b> which predicts a mean value of approximately 36 K, two to three times larger than the mean gas temperature in the absence of turbulent heating; iii) The intermittency of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating</b> can generate enough hot regions in cold diffuse HI clouds to explain the observed CH + abundance, if the rms velocity on a scale of 1 pc is at least 3 km s − 1, in agreement with previous results based on incompressible turbulence.

40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating,</b> mixing, and {{radiative}} cooling in an idealized model of cool cluster cores. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets are expected to drive turbulence and heat cluster cores. Cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM) and stirring by AGN jets are tightly coupled in a feedback loop. We impose the feedback loop by balancing radiative cooling with <b>turbulent</b> <b>heating.</b> In addition to heating the plasma, turbulence also mixes it, suppressing the formation of cold gas at small scales. In this regard, the effect of turbulence is analogous to thermal conduction. For uniform plasma in thermal balance (<b>turbulent</b> <b>heating</b> balancing radiative cooling), cold gas condenses only if the cooling time is shorter than the mixing time. This condition requires the turbulent kinetic energy to be ≳ the plasma internal energy; such high velocities in cool cores are ruled out by observations. The results with realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction are qualitatively similar to the hydrodynamic simulations. Simulations where the runaway cooling of the cool core is prevented due to mixing with the hot ICM show cold gas even with subsonic turbulence, consistent with observations. Thus, turbulent mixing is the likely mechanism via which AGN jets heat cluster cores.
