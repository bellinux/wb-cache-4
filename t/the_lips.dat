40|$|In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> {{feature that}} has the highest {{correlation}} with audio features is investigated. Audio features are selected as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of the audio signal.

In this study, we present two techniques based on class conditional probability analysis and canonical correlation analysis to estimate and compare the correlations between audio feature and each <b>lip</b> feature. <b>The</b> <b>lip</b> feature, which has the highest correlation to audio features, is identified among <b>the</b> above <b>lip</b> features.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that <b>the</b> speaker's <b>lip</b> shape and movement contain rich identity-related information and can be adopted for speaker identification and authentication. Among all <b>the</b> static <b>lip</b> features, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> texture (intensity variation inside <b>the</b> outer <b>lip</b> contour) is of high discriminative power to differentiate various speakers. However, <b>the</b> existing <b>lip</b> texture feature representations cannot describe the texture information adequately and provide unsatisfactory identification results. In this paper, a sparse representation of <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> texture is proposed and a corresponding visual speaker identification scheme is presented. In the training stage, a sparse dictionary is built based on the texture samples for each speaker. In the testing stage, for any <b>lip</b> image investigated, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> texture information is extracted and the reconstruction errors using all the dictionaries for every speaker are calculated. <b>The</b> <b>lip</b> image is identified to the speaker with the minimum reconstruction error.

50|$|Small defects of {{the upper}} and lower lip can be closed primarily. For <b>the</b> upper <b>lip,</b> defects of up to 1/4 (25%) of <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> may be closed primarily.

This means the edges of the defect are simply sutured {{together}} in three layers: oral mucosa, muscle, and skin. This closure has the best outcome because it re-establishes continuity of the orbicularis oris, which allows for oral competence, maximal preservation of sensation of <b>the</b> <b>lip,</b> continuity of vermilion border, and adequate size of the opening.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressures}} from <b>the</b> lower <b>lip</b> on <b>the</b> lower incisors were {{measured at the}} midline between the central incisors and between the left lateral incisor and canine. The measurements were made with <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> at rest and during swallowing of water in 24 boys and 40 girls aged 9 - 15 years. The children were divided into four groups, two treated with a lip bumper with and without an oral shield, and two with a lingual arch with and without springs for proclination of the lower incisors. Recordings of the pressures were made {{before the start of}} the treatment, and 3 and 8 months after the use of the appliance, as well as 4 months after the removal of <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> bumper or lingual arch. The treatment with a lip bumper did not change the pressure from <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> on <b>the</b> lower incisors at rest. The pressure at the midline during swallowing was also unaffected by <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> bumper therapy, but the pressure between the lateral incisor and canine increased. Thus, lip bumper therapy did not lead to decreased pressure from <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> on <b>the</b> incisors. Proclination of the lower incisors with a lingual arch resulted in an increase of the pressure from <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> at rest.

5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936).

5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b> The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the sealing {{mechanism}} of an oil seal, {{it is necessary to}} know its fundamental properties and movement now in action. There are two subjects in this study. One is to reveal the temperature dependence of fundamental properties, mainly wringing force, average wringing pressure and lip contact width, and the other is to know <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> temperature now in action and to know how the lubrication is carried out at <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> portion. <b>The</b> measurements were carried out with our devised instruments for the former subject and with a thermocouple for the latter. A simple analysis of <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> temperature obtained was made in order to know a mechanism of the lubrication. The results indicate that with the rise of temperature of oil seal, the wringing force and the average wringing pressure decrease because of the reduction of rubber elastic modulus and of thermal expansion of spring, and <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contact width hardly varies, and also indicate that under a constant temperature of lubricating oil, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> temperature never rises so high {{as in the case of}} free rising of oil temperature, and that the fluid lubrication is carried out at <b>the</b> <b>lip...</b>|$|R
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} lip contour {{tracking}} algorithm using attractorguided particle filtering. Usually {{it is difficult}} to robustly track <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contour because <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contour is highly deformable and the contrast between skin and lip colors is very low. It makes the traditional blind segmentation-based algorithms often fail to have robust and realistic results. But in fact, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contour is constrained by the facial muscles, the tracking configuration space can then be represented by a lower dimensional manifold. With this observation, we take some representative <b>lip</b> shapes as <b>the</b> attractors in the lower dimensional manifold. To resolve the low contrast problem, we adopt a color feature selection algorithm to maximize the separability between skin and lip colors. Then we integrate the shape priors and the discriminative feature into the attractor-guided particle filtering framework to track <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contour. <b>The</b> experimental result shows that we can track <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> contour robustly and efficiently. ...|$|R
