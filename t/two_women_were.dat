5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> <b>were</b> killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim.

5|$|Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde {{and imprisoned}} in the castle. He {{was accused of}} {{suspicious}} correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would have to support {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> entombed alive.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nevelson's death her {{estate was}} {{worth at least}} $100 million. Her son, Mike Nevelson, removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works, worth millions, to her friend and {{assistant}} of 25 years Diana MacKown, yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise. Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There was talk of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> lovers, MacKown maintained {{that she had never}} had a sexual relationship with Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood (1911–2007), {{the wife}} of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had {{approached}} the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, {{they fell in love}} almost from their first meeting; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer's muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, or suspected, that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer's concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams's life and affections was unchallengeable.|$|E

5|$|In September, President Arthur carried Irish {{republicans}} Muriel MacSwiney, {{widow of}} the recently deceased Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney, and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the Black and Tans, to New York. Wearing buttons with pictures of Harry Boland, an anti-treaty Irish nationalist {{who had been killed}} the previous month, the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> there to raise funds for orphans of Anti-Treaty IRA forces, who were then fighting in southern Ireland. In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute court order, was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on President Arthur; she was retrieved from the ship ten minutes before sailing time.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna, <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> {{poisoned}} {{at their}} workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of}} them were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}}'s {{effects were}} felt {{as far north}} as Lebanon and Syria and it was the strongest event in the Jordan Rift Valley since the 1927 Jericho earthquake which was centered near the Dead Sea. The heaviest damage occurred in the resort town of Eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged, and cracks formed in the sidewalks. Fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man {{died of a heart attack}} in Aqaba. In Saudi Arabia <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> reported dead and five deaths were reported in Egypt, with three of them occurring in the gulf resort town of Nuweiba. Eight buildings collapsed in Cairo where, just several years before, the much smaller 1992 Cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact. One person was killed and two were injured slightly at Al-Bad', Saudi Arabia and damage was reported there as well as the towns of Al-`Ula and Haql.|$|E
5|$|After the Privy Council was {{abolished}} by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1708 {{a structure}} of circuit courts {{was established in the}} same year with the hearing of witchcraft cases becoming part of its remit. So when Cowper and the minister from the nearby parish of Anstruther East, William Wadroper, brought charges of witchcraft against Laing and Lawson again in October 1708, it was heard by the circuit court in Perth a few weeks later. The <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> cautioned and released but the pair of ministers continued to bring prosecutions against them resulting in Laing and Lawson being imprisoned again in April 1709 until they could be tried on 20 May. Queen Anne issued an Act of Indemnity following the Jacobite rising in 1708 that anyone due to stand trial for crimes committed before 19 April 1709 were to be acquitted, pardoned, released, and discharged so, along with hundreds of others accused of a diverse set of offences, Laing and Lawson were pardoned and set free.|$|E
5|$|On the {{collapse}} of the Tsarist regime in February 1917, Olga's sister-in-law left Pavlovsk with her family, but Olga stayed, soon to be almost alone except for a single young domestic named Anna Egorova. (After the Revolution, Egorova entered the service of Prince Christopher of Greece and became the governess of his son, Michael.) Short of food, the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> limited to eating a little dry bread soaked in poor quality oil. Their safety was far from assured, and {{a few days after the}} October Revolution, Bolsheviks invaded and ransacked the palace. Olga was physically unharmed. She accepted the need to leave Russia, but the Bolsheviks refused to let her go and diplomatic help from Greece was not forthcoming in the aftermath of the National Schism. In June, Constantine had been deposed and exiled to Switzerland. As the Allies did not wish to establish a Greek republic or see Crown Prince George succeed his father, Constantine was replaced on the throne by his second son, Alexander, who was thought to be more favorable to the Allies and more malleable than his older brother. Venizelos held power and the supporters of the deposed king were arrested or executed.|$|E

5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E
