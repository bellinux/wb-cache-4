5|$|Species {{that have}} no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the {{waxwings}} Bombycilla, are effectively moving in response to winter weather and <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.|$|E

40|$|I {{comment on}} the recent Letter by Klimczak et al. [Opt. Lett. 38, 4679 (2013) ], in which supercontinuum was {{generated}} in a tellurite glass photonic crystal fiber. However, my results show that in the midinfrared 3 - 6 µm region, <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tellurite glass should be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than what the authors claimed...|$|R
60|$|The trapper {{found him}} distributing knives to the ferocious hags, who {{received}} the presents chanting a low monotonous song, that recalled <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> people, in various conflicts with the whites, and which extolled the pleasures and glory of revenge. The appearance of such a group was enough of itself to have deterred one, less accustomed to such sights than the old man, from trusting himself within the circle <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wild and repulsive rites.|$|R
50|$|Long-time sweethearts Ariston and Agnes find {{themselves}} ready {{to marry and}} settle down after <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> married partners. They have children from their previous marriages: Noel (Sam Concepcion later played by Piolo Pascual the son of Ariston) and Melanie (Julia Barretto-Padilla later on played by Claudine Barretto). The two do not develop a good relationship as step-siblings, and the idealization brings them to many personal problems leading them to love. Noel confides in Agnes and Melanie confides in Ariston.|$|R
5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> land, local {{residents}} {{discovered that they}} had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young {{children}} died, Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected by <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children. Mary Shelley revived a bit {{with the birth of}} Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E
5|$|Original Base Realignment and Closure {{commission}} plans only {{hinted at}} a Distributed Common Ground System being created at Otis.

5|$|The Polish victory infuriated the Soviets, {{leading to}} dozens of arrests and several executions among those {{connected}} to the Lit-Bel.; the former Lit-Bel leaders began accusing one another of culpability for <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> capital. Lenin considered the city vital to his plans, and ordered its immediate recapture, with the Red Army attempting several counteroffensives in April 1919.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{own rules}} Sheffield {{remained}} {{the centre of}} the footballing world until the onset of professionalism. The association matches versus London were considered only equalled in importance to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final. Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937. In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the parent}} company moving out of Eastleigh, Pirelli's {{remained}} a prominent force in the Hampshire League but <b>the</b> controversial <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ground in 2003 saw the club reluctantly withdraw from the league and fold.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{navigation}} {{systems will}} route the {{driver in the}} way he prefers to drive himself. They will also take the abilities and skills of the driver into consideration while planning a route designed to decrease the influence of individual stress and strain to the driver. Elderly drivers are in primary focus. They have developed avoidance strategies to cope with <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. These strategies vary between drivers, depending on variations of abilities and skills. In order to verify this hypothesis, a study was conducted at the DLR aimed at measuring the influence of the environment on the driver...|$|R
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, his {{grandmother}} Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she {{lost control of}} her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by {{his grandmother}}. <b>The</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors' club.|$|E
5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} for <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{hunting and fishing}} rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe {{had a right to}} assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E

25|$|Historians now {{view this}} {{movement}} as a millennialist response both directly to a lung disease spreading among Xhosa cattle at the time, and less directly to the stress to Xhosa society caused by <b>the</b> continuing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territory and autonomy.|$|R
5|$|The Raid on Genoa {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the harbour of the Italian city of Genoa {{during the first year}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. The survivors of the French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at Genoa and Impérieuse at Leghorn.|$|E
5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The group {{continued}} their Casbah residency {{into the new}} year, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill {{and was unable to}} play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> residency at the Casbah and Brown's departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.|$|E
50|$|In April 1951, German {{surveyors}} {{visited the}} area in the company of French officers. The local farmers protested the construction of a hard-surface airfield which would entail <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> land, and they demonstrated in Mainz, the capital of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Despite this vigorous opposition, the French occupational authorities began the construction of a modern airfield at the end of June 1951.|$|R
50|$|The 23 {{ships of}} RA 55A arrived in Britain without <b>loss,</b> while <b>the</b> German attempt {{to attack the}} convoy had led to <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Scharnhorst, <b>their</b> last {{operational}} capital ship in Norway.an action in which RA 55A’s escorting destroyers had played a significant role.|$|R
50|$|On 8 December the Lisbon packet {{arrived at}} Portsmouth with news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Duke of Clarence.

Clements, his officers, and crew had been saved, but with <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all <b>their</b> possessions.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed {{the formation of a}} separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E
5|$|As a Klingon moon, Praxis, explodes without warning, the {{starship}} USS Excelsior, commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu, {{is struck by}} the shock wave and its crew discovers {{that much of the}} moon has been obliterated. <b>The</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprises captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.|$|E
5|$|Between 1 October and 17 October, the Japanese {{delivered}} 15,000 {{troops to}} Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{positions on the}} east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Infantry Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) from the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments under the overall command of Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.|$|E
50|$|The worst {{threat to}} this and other rare local troglobites is <b>the</b> {{outright}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cave habitat, which is destroyed as the land is consumed for urban development, or during quarrying operations. Caves are also altered and polluted so that they cannot support this and other species.|$|R
25|$|In 2017, despite <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{practically}} <b>their</b> {{entire state}} championship teams starters, the Bulldogs started the season 3-0 including a 28-27 victory over South County with kicker Chris Hilldrup draining a key extra point in overtime. The Bulldogs will face West Springfield High School in their next matchup.|$|R
50|$|After the {{destruction}} of Star One and <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 80% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fleet in the Intergalactic War, the Federation fell apart. However, by the fourth series, the Federation was regaining power due to new mind-control drugs ("Traitor"). Servalan, under the alias Commissioner Sleer was slowly regaining her power. However in the penultimate episode ("Warlord") Avon unites the various anti-Federation resistance groups and gives them the antidote to the mind control drugs leaving {{the fate of the}} Federation uncertain.|$|R
