5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E

MacLennan emphasized media savvy, and AUPE became effective as a force for social and legislative change in Alberta.|$|E
25|$|Strachan's {{first full}} season as manager in 1997–98 saw the Sky Blues <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and McAllister {{play a key}} role {{controlling}} the midfield helped by George Boateng. They played some fine football in a fast attacking side spearheaded by Darren Huckerby and Dion Dublin, well placed in the table and reaching the FA Cup quarter finals in 1998. His final season at the club was like his time at Coventry in microcosm, a poor start – including defeat by Tranmere Rovers in the league cup – followed by a stylish and creditable finish. Some of the home form is regarded by many City fans as among the best of the previous decade with Robbie Keane and Cedric Roussel leading the attack. The Sky television team even calling them 'The Entertainers' at one point thanks to a two-month unbeaten autumn schedule culminating in victory over Aston Villa and a memorable Keane effort to beat Arsenal. That said, Coventry's habit of letting opponents off the hook and failing to find any kind of edge away from home prevented a top 10 finish. The line-up included the likes of Robbie Keane, Mustapha Hadji, Carlton Palmer, Mo Konjić and Youssef Chippo in a side, however indifferent on their travels, capable of beating the very best opponents in flamboyant style at Highfield Road.|$|E

500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel.

2500|$|The National Review {{described}} Barr {{as one of}} the {{few people}} able to [...] "ask effective questions and make clear points" [...] while questioning government witnesses during the 1995 House Waco siege hearings on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Federal Bureau of Investigation actions against the Branch Davidians in 1993, sponsored by subcomittees of the House Judiciary Committee and Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Barr has written: [...] "The hearing was a farce: a virtual lovefest, during which members of the Clinton Administration responded to softball questions from their colleagues in the House with superficial answers, and Republican queries were ignored or glossed over with disdain, if not outright contempt." [...] Barr called for Congress to reopen investigations, but senior House Republicans refused. In 2003 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Barr wrote: [...] "here remains time to turn back the constitutional clock and roll back excessive post-9/11 powers before we <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> into another Japanese internment or, closer to our own experiences, before we witness a legally sanctioned Ruby Ridge or Waco scenario." ...|$|E

No one gets after the run game as well as Carimi. Neil Hayes of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: [...] "Many consider Carimi {{to be the best}} offensive-tackle prospect in the class ... Carimi played well against top competition and his feet are quick enough to play left tackle." [...] CBS Sports lauded [...] "his prototypical size" [...] and [...] "excellent athleticism". As to his pass blocking, it noted that he has [...] "the elite agility and nimble feet to protect the quarterback's blindside. Very difficult to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> against because of his lateral movement and solid footwork. Also protects the inside lane well. Delivers a strong hand punch capable of knocking back an opponent .... Uses his length to block his man with one hand and knock an edge blitzer off his path with the other." [...] With regard to his run blocking, it said he is [...] "known as an athletic pass protector, but is a strong blocker". While he exclusively played left tackle in college, he was projected by some as a left tackle and by others as a right tackle.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of pike men {{potentially}} {{diminished the}} defensive {{capacity of the}} company, as the rate of fire of firearms was slow, and musketeers needed to shelter {{in the safety of}} the squares of pike men when they were reloading. To counter this problem the important tactical invention of volley fire by ranks was introduced, combined with the ancient concept of the counter-march, already used by the Roman legions. This combined manoeuvre had the musketeers deploy in blocks of five or more ranks and nine files, in which the ranks successively fired their weapon simultaneously. After discharging its weapon the first rank would turn right, <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the block-formation and march to the rear, where it would start reloading, while the new first rank fired a volley, and so on. This tactic enabled the unit to sustain a relatively rapid rate of fire of sufficient [...] "density" [...] to discourage a charge by the pike men of the opposing square. The manoeuvre had to be executed in a disciplined way, however, to avoid confusion in the ranks, especially as the enemy was not sitting idly by. It therefore had to be drilled into the soldiers. And this drilling of the tactical manoeuvre was one of the mainstays of the reform. It required an attendant organisational reform, because the education of recruits now had to be entrusted to specialists, the company sergeants. At first the musketeers were placed on both flanks of a square of pike men, as in the conventional formation. But after 1609 the musketeers were placed in a continuous front before the pike men when they fired their volleys, only retreating into the safety of the pike squares when the opposing pike men, or the cavalry, charged them.|$|E
