40|$|When we {{consider}} internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> we usually refer to research explaining {{the benefits of}} transnational relations, collaboration, or cross-cultural research. Therefore, internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education</b> {{seems to be a}} rather abstract or impersonal endeavor, mostly depending on publications. However, when taking a closer look at internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> it becomes obvious, that it is not as abstract as it seems. Rather, there are individual researchers shaping <b>the</b> internationalization of <b>music</b> <b>education</b> through their work, and by engaging in various kinds of collaborations, including conferences, panels or extending invitations to colleagues. Then, internationalization loses its abstract character and becomes a rather personal endeavor, depending on individuals and their efforts to foster the formation of a global <b>music</b> <b>education</b> community. To recognize better how internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education</b> works, we need to learn more about internationalization as a development particularly driven by individuals. This could support the further formation of <b>the</b> global <b>music</b> <b>education</b> community. This chapter investigates the impact individual researchers have on <b>the</b> internationalization of <b>music</b> <b>education.</b> It starts with a short reflection of what internationalization is, in general and concerning <b>music</b> <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> second section explores the role individual researchers have played in internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> final part summarizes the findings and presents new perspectives for internationalizing <b>music</b> <b>education</b> concerning role models or mentors and how they can support the further formation of <b>the</b> global <b>music</b> <b>education</b> community...|$|R
