25|$|The rhetorical {{question}} mark or percontation point {{was invented by}} Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a {{rhetorical question}}; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. <b>This</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but these are very rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|A.×gravesii {{differs from}} Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii), another {{descendant}} of A.pinnatifidum, {{by having a}} blade broadest at the middle or between the middle and the base, {{rather than at the}} base itself, and by the presence of brown color throughout the stipe and sometimes into the rachis. In contrast to Boydston's spleenwort (A.×boydstoniae), A.×gravesii has fewer than fifteen pairs of pinnae, which are not sessile, and when dark color is present in the rachis, it covers less than seven-eights of that structure. The most similar hybrid to A.×gravesii is probably Kentucky spleenwort (A.×kentuckiense), a hybrid of A.pinnatifidum and ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron). In A.×kentuckiense, the blade tapers at the base, the second and third pairs of pinnae being shorter than the fourth and fifth; in A.×gravesii, all these pairs are approximately equal inside. A.×kentuckiense takes on a somewhat papery textures when dried, while A.×gravesii is more leathery. Finally, the guard cells of the latter average 49micrometers, slightly larger than the 46micrometers of the former. As <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> only be examined by microscope, and the ranges of individual guard cell size overlap, some care is required in its use; 30 measurements from a single pinna were used to obtain an average length in previous studies.

25|$|A.×gravesii can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} a number of the other Asplenium hybrids in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. It differs from Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii), another descendant of A.pinnatifidum, by having a blade broadest at the middle or between the middle and the base, rather than at the base itself, and by the presence of brown color throughout the stipe and sometimes into the rachis. A.×trudellii also has a slightly thicker texture, lighter brown spores, and two to three stalked and toothed pinnae at the base. In contrast to Boydston's spleenwort (A.×boydstoniae), A.×kentuckiense has fewer than fifteen pairs of pinnae, which are not sessile, and when dark color is present in the rachis, it covers less than seven-eights of that structure. The most similar hybrid to A.×kentuckiense is probably Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid of A.pinnatifidum and Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi).

There is also the comparatively more common stacked character , which doesn't accurately reflect her name either, as it has a different pronunciation. While some vendors may write her name by hand, those that are strictly electronically managed, such as the Public Security Bureau, are unable to correctly enter her name. Because of this, some computers record her name as 马CHENG or 马马马马.

The most powerful effects of poetry and music have been displayed, and perhaps are still displayed, where these arts are but in a very low and imperfect state. The rude hearer is affected by the principles which operate in these arts even in their rudest condition; and he is not skilful enough to perceive the defects. But as the arts advance towards their perfection, the science of criticism advances with equal pace, and the pleasure of judges is frequently interrupted by the faults which we discovered in the most finished compositions.|$|E

By this want of sympathy they would cease to be a House of Commons. For it is not the derivation of the power of that House from the people, which makes it in a distinct sense their representative. The King is the representative of the people; so are the Lords; so are the Judges. They all are trustees for the people, as well as the Commons; because no power is given for the sole sake of the holder; and although Government certainly is an institution of Divine authority, yet its forms, and the persons who administer it, all originate from the people.|$|E

6000|$|For {{this art}} of {{painting}} {{is a very}} simple thing indeed, according to Mr. Collier. It consists merely in the 'representation of natural objects by means of pigments on a flat surface.' There is nothing, he tells us, 'so very mysterious' in it after all. 'Every natural object appears {{to us as a}} sort of pattern of different shades and colours,' and 'the task of the artist is so to arrange his shades and colours on his canvas that a similar pattern is produced.' This is obviously pure common-sense, and it is clear that art-definitions of <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be comprehended by the very meanest capacity and, indeed, may be said to appeal to it. For the perfect development, however, of this pattern-producing faculty a severe training is necessary. The art student must begin by painting china, crockery, and 'still life' generally. He should rule his straight lines and employ actual measurements wherever it is possible. He will also find that a plumb-line comes in very useful. Then he should proceed to Greek sculpture, for from pottery to Phidias is only one step. Ultimately he will arrive at the living model, {{and as soon as he}} can 'faithfully represent any object that he has before him' he is a painter. After this there is, of course, only one thing to be considered, the important question of subject. Subjects, Mr. Collier tells us, are of two kinds, ancient and modern. Modern subjects are more healthy than ancient subjects, but the real difficulty of modernity in art is that the artist passes his life with respectable people, and that respectable people are unpictorial. 'For picturesqueness,' consequently, he should go to 'the rural poor,' and for pathos to the London slums. Ancient subjects offer the artist a very much wider field. If he is fond of 'rich stuffs and costly accessories' he should study the Middle Ages; if he wishes to paint beautiful people, 'untrammelled by any considerations of historical accuracy,' he should turn to the Greek and Roman mythology; and if he is a 'mediocre painter,' he should choose his 'subject from the Old and New Testament,' a recommendation, by the way, that many of our Royal Academicians seem already to have carried out. To paint a real historical picture one requires the assistance of a theatrical costumier and a photographer. From the former one hires the dresses and the latter supplies one with the true background. Besides subject-pictures there are also portraits and landscapes. Portrait painting, Mr. Collier tells us, 'makes no demands on the imagination.' As is the sitter, so is the work of art. If the sitter be commonplace, for instance, it would be 'contrary to the fundamental principles of portraiture to make the picture other than commonplace.' There are, however, certain rules that should be followed. One of the most important of these is that the artist should always consult his sitter's relations before he begins the picture. If they want a profile he must do them a profile; if they require a full face he must give them a full face; and he should be careful also to get their opinion as to the costume the sitter should wear and 'the sort of expression he should put on.' 'After all,' says Mr. Collier pathetically, 'it is they who have to live with the picture.' ...|$|E
