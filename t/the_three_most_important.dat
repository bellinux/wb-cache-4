5|$|Little {{more can}} be said of Padarn, though he later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed details of his life. He may have been more closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E

5|$|Morgaon is the adhya pitha – {{foremost}} {{centre of}} {{worship of the}} Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. It attracts {{the greatest number of}} pilgrims in the Ashtavinayak circuit. Both the primary scriptures of the Ganapatya sect praise Morgaon. While Mudgala Purana dedicates 22 chapters to Morgaon's greatness, Ganesha Purana states that Morgaon (Mayurapuri) is among <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> places for Ganesha and the only one on earth (Bhuloka). The other locations are Kailash in heaven (actually Kailash is a mountain on earth in the Himalayas, believed to have the abode of Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati) and Adi-Shesha's palace in Patala (underworld). According to a tradition, the temple is without beginning and without an end. Another tradition maintains {{that at the time of}} pralaya (the dissolution of the world), Ganesha will enter yoganidra here. Its holiness is compared with Kashi, the sacred Hindu city.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{experienced}} {{its second}} major peak in occupation during the Late Classic period, between AD 600 and AD 830. Most {{of the major}} architecture at the site was built during this surge in activity and the city reached its maximum size. Motul de San José became one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> cities around Lake Petén Itzá and was approximately {{the same size as}} Tayasal, while it was slightly smaller than Nixtun Ch'ich'. There was renewed growth in the city's satellite sites, Chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in the Late Classic. Buena Vista experienced only light occupation at this time. Major construction work took place at Akte including the building of the principal platform and its causeway. It also appears that the rulers of Akte erected several stelae. La Trinidad de Nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including the Mesoamerican ballcourt, the major residential complexes, four plazas and the port facilities.|$|E

Moreover, environmental research is rarely published in top IR journals, although there has been a recent surge in work focused on climate change.

The sixth problem was the mathematical description of the axioms of physics. In the part of his presentation relating to this problem, Hilbert noted that, in parallel with research on the foundations of geometry, one could approach the problem of an axiomatic construction, along the same lines, of the physical sciences in which mathematics played an exclusive role, and in particular, probability theory and mechanics.|$|R
