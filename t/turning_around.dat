5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

40|$|Application Service Maintenance Projects {{normally}} {{deals with}} Incidents as First Level support function. Incidents in majority directly link with Production Environment, so <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents {{is a significant}} factor. Many Companies are having Service Level Agreements with Customer for <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. There {{is a need to}} focus on Estimating and Predicting <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. Improvement in <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time helps in improving the Service Level Agreements earlier agreed with the Customer. Saved time can be diverted to other Project Activities like Enhancements or for new requests. This will also helps as one of the paths for Companies to get new business with the Customer. We have used Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) V 1. 2 Quantitative Project Management(QPM) methodology for Application Service Maintenance(ASM) Projects for estimating and predicting <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> time for incidents. By implementing this best practice in SEI CMMI Level 5 Company we have achieved a significant improvement of approximately 50 percent reduction in Average <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for incidents. </p...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{leaving the}} station, trains make a slight left hand turn, {{followed}} by a straight segment of track. This leads into another left hand turn and trains then climb the 100 ft lift hill. At the top, the track drops at a 53-degree angle. The maximum speed may vary between 50 and 55 miles per hour (80 and 88km/h) depending on the weather conditions, time of day and the load. Next the train rises into a right hand <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> This <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> leads to a sharp second drop, before rising over another hill, and passing through a left hand second <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> The second <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> has a double down element as riders descend another drop into the wooden structure. The ride makes another out and back run, and after the final <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> hits the brake run, ending the ride.|$|R

5|$|Kerrigan's {{character}} is more central to StarCraft: Brood War (1998), {{as in the}} wake of the Overmind's death at the hands of Tassadar in the conclusion of StarCraft, Kerrigan regains her independence from the Zerg hive mind and dedicates her efforts to becoming the sole leader of the Zerg Swarm. She presents herself on the Protoss colony world Shakuras, where she informs Zeratul and the Protoss of a new Overmind growing on Char, manipulating them into destroying Zerg forces running rival to her goals. She also gains an ally in an apparently infested Samir Duran, who infiltrates the newly arrived forces of the United Earth Directorate (UED) and attempts to sabotage their mission to enslave the Zerg and seize control of the sector of the galaxy. However, the UED is successful in capturing the new Overmind, and Kerrigan exploits the threat of the UED to forge an alliance with Mengsk, Raynor and his new Protoss allies, <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> the war against the UED. However, Kerrigan quickly betrays this alliance and strikes at the armies of Raynor and Mengsk, heavily damaging both groups. Accompanied by Duran, Kerrigan returns to Shakuras to abduct the Protoss leader Raszagal, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind on Char, after which all Zerg fall under Kerrigan's control—around this time, she begins her self-proclamation as the Queen of Blades. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but kills her when he realizes her mind has been destroyed by Kerrigan's brainwashing. Kerrigan, surprised by his actions, allows him to live. Soon after, Kerrigan's position on Char is attacked by a vengeful Protoss fleet, the remnants of the UED's invasion force and a mercenary fleet commanded by Mengsk. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan's forces prevail, crippling her enemies and eradicating the UED fleet, thereby securing a dominant position in the sector.|$|E
