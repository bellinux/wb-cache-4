25|$|By {{the time}} Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already {{burdened}} {{with a heavy}} budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the International Monetary Fund and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted <b>to</b> <b>institutional</b> changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned {{the formation of the}} Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, {{on the part of the}} Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).|$|E

Ultimately such talks foundered when the Houses of Laity and Clergy voted in favour of union but the House of Bishops vetoed it, largely due to concerns over the maintenance of the apostolic succession of the episcopacy.|$|E

25|$|Initial public {{offering}} (IPO) or {{stock market launch}} {{is a type of}} {{public offering}} in which shares of a company usually are sold <b>to</b> <b>institutional</b> investors that in turn, sell to the general public, on a securities exchange, for the first time. Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as going public.|$|E
