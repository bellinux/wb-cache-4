5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer.

They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings.

The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
