5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b> the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E

If Fergus was indeed responsible for Whithorn's revival, it would have almost certainly aided his royal aspirations since securing ecclesiastical independence could {{have been part of}} the process of ensuring political independence. Gilla Aldan's successor was Christian (died 1186), a man who was consecrated in 1154 by Hugh d'Amiens, Archbishop of Rouen (died 1164), who in turn may have been acting as a proxy for Roger de Pont l'Evêque, Archbishop-elect of York (died 1181).|$|E

In 1997, following the amalgamation {{of two of the}} city's largest hospitals, the Emergency Department at the Victoria General closed. The paramedic triage system was moved to the city's only remaining adult emergency department, located at the New Halifax Infirmary.

500|$|Various early {{theories}} situated the Wicked Priest within {{time periods}} running the full gamut from the pre-Hasmonaean period, {{to that of}} early Christianity, {{to that of the}} Crusades. However, that the Wicked Priest [...] "ruled over Israel" [...] (1QpHab 8.10) and was able to partake in [...] "plundering" [...] (9.7) has persuaded most scholars <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b> consideration the predecessors of the Hasmonean High Priests, who did not share their ability to attack other nations militarily, having been militarily subjugated to Egypt or Syria, and their successors, who were dominated by the Romans. To a lesser extent, that the Wicked Priest was once called [...] "by the name of the truth" [...] (8.8-9) is used to disqualify the pre-Maccabean, Hellenized High Priests, who were not held in high regard by their coreligionists.|$|E
500|$|Warbrick said of {{his time}} in the British Isles: [...] "My {{impression}} of England and its people during the tour was a very favourable one, more especially does this apply to private individuals. I found them everywhere very kind and attentive and apparently anxious to make one's visit as pleasant as possible". The term [...] "private individuals" [...] may have been used <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b> praise both the RFU and London press. Following the tour he also criticised the partiality of the English referees, and believed that the English administrators displayed a double standard in their treatment of the Natives; the RFU treated the Native team's motives for touring with suspicion, believing the enterprise to be speculative and criticising them for not upholding the amateur principles the RFU liked to espouse. Yet the RFU continued to select Andrew Stoddart for England, despite him touring with the speculative and unsanctioned 1888 British team that travelled to New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1774 by German mycologist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Helvella infula (the original genus spelling was Elvela). In 1849, Elias Magnus Fries established the genus Gyromitra, distinguishing it from Helvella {{based on a}} gyrose hymenium (marked with wavy lines or convolutions); the genus {{was based on the}} type species Gyromitra esculenta. [...] Later, in 1886, French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to Gyromitra. The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct taxonomical placement of these fungi. In 1907, Jean Boudier moved both G.esculenta and H.infula into a newly created genus he called Physomitra; he retained the genus Gyromitra but [...] "based it on an entirely different character so as <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b> the genus the very species on which it was founded". In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms, Fred J. Seaver proposed that both were synonymous, representing variable forms of the same species. His suggestion was not adopted by later mycologists, who identified various differences between the two species, including fruiting time as well as macroscopic and microscopic differences.|$|E

Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness?

2500|$|The edifice, {{dedicated}} then to Saint Mary of Constantinople (...) , was officiated by the Dominicans, which {{before the}} Ottoman conquest had also a monastery {{in the city}} on the Black Sea. Here was brought from Caffa a large icon of the Hodegetria type, which now is kept in the Dominican monastery of SS. Peter and Paul in Galata. Due to all that, {{at the beginning of the}} sixteenth century the church of Saint Mary had turned into the center of this quarter predominantly inhabited by Italians, but the building fell soon in disrepair. Under Sultan Murad IV (r. 1623–1640) the decision was taken <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b> the walled city the Christians who were not Ottoman subjects and to resettle them in Galata and Pera. As a consequence, and after riots between Christian and Muslims, the church was closed in 1636, and in 1640 it was transformed into a mosque by Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha (d. 1644). As mentioned above, only the Hodegetria Icon could be moved with great difficulties to Galata.|$|E
