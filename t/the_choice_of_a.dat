5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} and fought in World War I for the 43rd Regiment (Duke of Cornwall’s Own Rifles) as a lieutenant in the 21st Infantry Battalion, starting in May 1915. That December he suffered a knee injury, and was sent to England to recover. He was given <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> posting in Le Havre away from the action, but chose to return to his battalion at the front. He returned to the 21st Battalion in August 1916 for the Battle of the Somme and was killed in action on September 16, 1916 near Courcelette, France. His body was never recovered. His brother Charles died in action in May 1915.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{discussion}} {{started with}} the plans to connect Meland, Flatøy and Lindøy with bridges. This {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in May 1975, and consisted of the Krossnessundet Bridge between Flatøy and Meland, which opened in November 1978. The Hagelsund Bridge opened on 1 April 1982 and connected Flatøy to Lindås and Knarvik, thus also connecting Meland and Lindås. Both bridges were partially financed with tolls. The plans for a pontoon bridge were presented to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on 31 March 1981. They supported <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pontoon bridge. The decision to construct the bridge was taken by parliament on 9 December 1987, but they demanded that a larger ship channel be constructed.|$|E
5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being {{able to continue to}} the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E

40|$|Why do {{countries}} {{pick one}} electoral system over another? As Damien Bol, Jean-Benoit Pilet and Pedro Riera write, {{there is often}} <b>an</b> assumption that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electoral system {{is closely related to}} the calculations of dominant political parties who select systems that are likely to benefit them in elections. However based on <b>a</b> study <b>of</b> European countries between 1945 and 2011, they illustrate that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electoral system can be shaped significantly by <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> neighbouring/similar states...|$|R
5|$|Like the {{previous}} two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then elect a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear favorite of Democratic–Republicans was Jefferson, although he was very reluctant to run. There was little doubt that Adams would be <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{great majority of the}} Federalists. Even so, Hamilton also had hoped to lead the party.|$|E

5|$|Mysteries of the Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being {{able to continue to}} the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{stayed in}} office under {{pressure}} from some of his Politburo associates, though in practice the country was not governed by Brezhnev, but instead by a collective leadership led by Suslov, Ustinov, Gromyko, and Yuri Andropov. Konstantin Chernenko, due to his close relationship with Brezhnev, had also acquired influence. While the Politburo was pondering who would take Brezhnev's place, his health continued to worsen. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successor would {{have been influenced by}} Suslov, but since he died in January 1982, before Brezhnev, Andropov took Suslov's place in the Central Committee Secretariat. With Brezhnev's health worsening, Andropov showed his Politburo colleagues that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's reprisals any more, and launched a major anti-corruption campaign. On 10 November 1982, Brezhnev died and was honored with major state funeral and buried 5 days later at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.|$|E
5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lesser city as the capital.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly {{the type of}} material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E

5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} {{plans for}} Blood-C, {{it was decided}} to shift its setting based on positive feedback from the change of setting between Blood: The Last Vampire and the franchise's first anime series Blood+. The only elements to be retained were the first name of the main character, having a katana as her weapon, and the basic premise of her defeating monsters with that sword. The wish for the project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred the collaboration with CLAMP, which became {{a large part of the}} anime's marketing campaign. Fujisaku, when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for the series, said that it was to fully expand and build upon the basic concept established in Blood: The Last Vampire. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> school setting, the first of its kind to be featured in the Blood franchise, was chosen because Mizushima wanted to portray a school life for Saya. When asked, Mizushima did not find the change from his previous comedy anime-based turnout a barrier to his work, but did feel pressure when handling a project within the Blood franchise.|$|E
