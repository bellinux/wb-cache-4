The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of}} the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E

This radical change became known as the [...] "all or nothing" [...] principle, which most major navies later adopted for their own battleships. With this new armor scheme, the armor on the battleship was increased to 41.1% of the displacement.|$|E

2500|$|Interference and {{obstruction}} are an inevitable {{aspect of this}} sport, since two players are confined within a shared space. [...] Generally, the rules entitle players to a direct straight line access to the ball, room for a reasonable swing and an unobstructed shot to {{any part of the}} front wall. When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a [...] "let" [...] and the referee (or the players themselves if there is no official) then interprets the extent of the interference. [...] The referee may elect to allow a let and the players then replay the point, or award a [...] "stroke" [...] to the appealing player (meaning that he is declared the winner of that point) depending on the degree of interference, whether the interfering player made an adequate effort to avoid interfering, and whether the player interfered with was likely to have hit a winning shot had the interference not occurred. [...] An exception <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> occurs when the interfering player is directly {{in the path of the}} other player's swing, effectively preventing the swing, in which case a stroke is always awarded.|$|E
2500|$|When a player's shot hits their {{opponent}} {{prior to}} hitting the front wall, interference has occurred. If {{the ball was}} travelling towards the side wall when it hit the opponent, or if it had already hit the side wall and was travelling directly to the front wall, it is usually a let. [...] However, it is a stroke to the player who hit the ball if the ball was travelling straight to the front wall when the ball hit the opponent, without having first hit the side wall. Generally after a player has been hit by the ball, both players stand still; if the struck player is standing {{directly in front of}} the player who hit the ball he loses the stroke, if he is not straight in front, a let is played. If it is deemed that the player who is striking the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, he will lose the stroke. An exception <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> occurs when the player hitting the ball has [...] "turned", i.e., let the ball pass him on one side, but then hit it on the other side as it came off the back wall. In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who was hit by the ball.|$|E
2500|$|While all {{important}} political {{groups in the}} Saar supported the Saar's return to Germany before Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power, opponents of Nazism in the Saar began having doubts and misgivings about a return of the Saar to Germany after Hitler's rise to power. Due to Hitler's oppression of their German counterparts, Communists and socialists in the Saar supported {{a continuation of the}} League of Nations administration and a delay in the plebiscite until after the Nazis were no longer in power in Germany. Meanwhile, Roman Catholics in the Saar were divided in regards to returning to German rule. In order to achieve victory in this referendum, the Nazis resorted to [...] "a mixture of cajolery and brutal pressure". In 1933, Sarah Wambaugh, {{one of the members of}} the Plebiscite Commission, stated that complaints of a Nazi [...] "reign of terror" [...] were made by non-Nazi Saarlanders and by the foreign press. These complaints included allegations that the Nazis engaged in intimidation, [...] "espionage, secret denunciations, kidnappings ..., ... interception of letters and telegrams, [...] listening-in to telephone conversations", among other things. In response <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the Saar Governing Commission had to [...] "promugulat several restrictive decrees for the maintenance of public order". In November 1934, fearing armed intervention by France, the Nazi German government reduced its belligerency and changed its tactics. As a part of this, Joseph Burckel, Hitler's commissioner for the Saar, banned the wearing of uniforms within a 25-mile zone along the Saar frontier between 10 January 1935 and 10 February 1935. In addition, Burckel also banned meetings, parades, and processions in this area. Likewise, , the Nazi leader in the Saar, told his followers to obey the strictest discipline and implemented harsh penalties for any infractions.|$|E

When I at last finished they all sat speechless, looking into each other's faces and waiting for an expression of opinion.|$|E
