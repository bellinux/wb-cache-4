25|$|Interpreters {{are used}} to execute source code from a {{programming}} language line-by-line. The interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters {{is that they can}} easily be extended to an interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> and performed immediately.|$|E
25|$|In Windows XP and later, {{there is}} no default local Data Recovery Agent and no {{requirement}} to have one. Setting SYSKEY to mode 2 or 3 (syskey <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate the risk of unauthorized decryption through the local Administrator account. This is because the local user's password hashes, stored in the SAM file, are encrypted with the Syskey, and the Syskey value is not available to an offline attacker who does not possess the Syskey passphrase/floppy.|$|E

40|$|The {{proximal}} duodenum {{of eight}} marsupial species, (koala, common brushtail possum, ring-tailed possum, common wombat, great grey kangaroo, parma wallaby, short-nosed bandicoot and tiger cat) were investigated immunohistochemically using 12 specific antisera for gut hormones. Several types of immunoreactive cells were {{seen on the}} intestinal villi and in crypts of these species: 9 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the koala; 8 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the common brushtail possum; 7 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the common wombat; 6 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the short-nosed bandicoot and 5 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the ringtailed possum, great grey kangaroo, parma wallaby and tiger cat. Gastrin-, somatostatin-, motilin- and serotonin-immunoreactive cells were seen in all species examined. A few BPP-, enteroglucagon-, CCK-, secretin-, GIP- and neurotensin-immunoreactive cells were seen but only in few species. A few substance P-immunoreactive cells were detected only in the koala. Immunoreactive cells were also seen in Brunner's glands: 5 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the parma wallaby; 3 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the great grey kangaroo and tiger cat; 2 <b>types</b> <b>in</b> the koala and common wombat; 1 <b>type</b> <b>in</b> the short-nosed bandicoot.

25|$|The Console Command Processor, or CCP, {{accepted}} {{input from}} the keyboard and conveyed results to the terminal. CP/M itself would work with either a printing terminal or a video terminal. All CP/M commands had to be <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> on the command line. The console would most often display the A> prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a video terminal, this would usually {{be followed by a}} blinking cursor supplied by the terminal. The CCP would await {{input from the}} user.|$|E
25|$|In Windows 2000, XP or later, the user's RSA {{private key}} is {{encrypted}} using a hash of the user's NTLM password hash plus the user name – {{use of a}} salted hash makes it extremely difficult to reverse the process and recover the private key without knowing the user's passphrase. Also, again, setting Syskey to mode 2 or 3 (Syskey <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate this attack, since the local user's password hash will be stored encrypted in the SAM file.|$|E
25|$|From December 1980 onwards, Kekkonen {{suffered}} from an undisclosed disease {{that appeared to}} affect his brain functions, sometimes leading to delusional thoughts. He had begun to suffer occasional brief memory lapses {{as early as the}} autumn of 1972; they became more frequent during the late 1970s. Around the same time, Kekkonen's eyesight deteriorated so much that for his last few years in office, all of his official papers had to be <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> block letters. Kekkonen had also {{suffered from}} a failing sense of balance since the mid-1970s and from enlargement of his prostate gland since 1974. He was also subject to occasional violent headaches and suffered from diabetes from the autumn of 1979.|$|E

25|$|Tatra Film {{commissioned}} the screenplay from the Slovak-American Jozef Žák-Marušiak (1885–1979; immigrated in 1911) from Lakšárska Nová Ves, western Slovakia, who based it on a two-volume novel by the Slovak-American journalist Gustáv Maršall-Petrovský (1862–1916). The novel was the filmmakers' original inspiration {{for making the}} movie. The screenplay had features of a shooting script. It was <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> Slovak, on a US typewriter without diacritics, with English camera directions. However, Žák-Marušiak delivered barely {{a third of the}} screenplay before the team's departure for Slovakia, some of it arrived by mail during the shoot, and the rest did not reach them before the film was finished. The filmmakers improvised and used the play Jánošík by Jiří Mahen translated to Slovak by Martin Rázus in 1920.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, Kazembek was {{transferred}} to St. Petersburg University, which by his initiative was reorganized into the main Russian post-secondary institution for studying Oriental languages. In 1855, he became dean of the newly formed faculty. In 1863, he secured {{the establishment of the}} Department of Oriental History. He organized internships for students who showed interest in field studies of Oriental cultures. In 1854, he published another linguistic work named Study Manual for Turkish Language Courses, which included several reading materials <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> various scripts, and a Russian-Turkish dictionary of 6,700 words (the richest one at the time). That same year, he also published The Explanation of the Russian Words Similar to Those in Oriental Languages, a major work on loanwords in the Russian language.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{potentially}} offensive words and word combinations were automatically censored in messages that were <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> any chat channel, be it public, private, group, or club chat. Users {{were able to}} report inappropriate or offensive behavior of other users to moderators by accessing the PlayStation Home Safe Screen. Moderators reviewed these reports periodically, and took action against a user's account based on the type and severity of the offense. A limited number of live moderators also patrolled PlayStation Home, who {{had the ability to}} take action against users immediately. These moderators were often invisible to other users, and typically would not type in public chat. Suspensions and bans were made against a user's PSN account, and restricted their ability not only to use PlayStation Home, but any other online service on PSN. Users were also able to change their communication settings to block or mute messages from users who were not on their friends list.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cases have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the concept of}} initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{documentary}} The Thunderbirds Companion, Anderson {{explained how}} {{a rise in}} filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused Thunderbirds to be made [...] "as an American show". During the character development and voice casting process, the Andersons' main priority was {{to ensure that the}} series had transatlantic appeal, thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer.

500|$|Fleming {{had first}} {{mentioned}} to friends {{during the war}} {{that he wanted to}} write a spy novel, an ambition he achieved within two months with Casino Royale. He started writing the book at Goldeneye on 17 February 1952, gaining inspiration from his own experiences and imagination. He claimed afterwards that he wrote the novel to distract himself from his forthcoming wedding to the pregnant Charteris, and called the work his [...] "dreadful oafish opus". His manuscript was <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> London by Joan Howe (mother of travel writer Rory MacLean), and Fleming's red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partially based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had <b>typed</b> <b>in.</b> Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{motor neurone}} disease, Hawking {{is unable to}} speak, and he {{communicates}} using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking writes a text onto the computer, which is then spoken by a voice syntheziser. Because of this, Hawking had to write all his lines on his computer, while the staff recorded them by placing a microphone {{in front of the}} computer's speaker. [...] "It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show", Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> himself and we recorded with our microphones as if it had come out of a regular mouth." [...] Some of Hawking's lines were difficult to record. In particular, the word [...] "Fruitopia" [...] was difficult for Hawking's computer to [...] "put together" [...] correctly, and it [...] "took forever" [...] to make the word sound right from the voice synthesizer.|$|E
500|$|Thousands of ZX81 {{programs}} were published, either as printed listings {{that could be}} <b>typed</b> <b>in</b> or as ready-made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape. Many computer magazines featured ZX81 program listings – some, such as Sinclair Programs, were dedicated entirely to listings – while many individuals became the archetypal [...] "bedroom programmers", producing games and applications which they produced, marketed, recorded, and sold from their own homes. Some went on to found their own software houses, employing teams of programmers – {{some of whom were}} still at school – to produce programs for the ZX81 and other computers. Existing companies also sold software; Psion produced a series of ZX81 programs in close association with Sinclair, including a flight simulator, while ICL's range of ZX81 programs sold over 100,000 cassettes in less than three months. Psion's success with the ZX81 {{had a profound effect on}} the future of the company. Its work on the ZX81 database program Vu-File led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants, which resulted in the launch in 1984 of the Psion Organiser, the world's first handheld personal computer. [...] Some of the most popular ZX81 games (Psion's Flight Simulation being an example) were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine's colour and sound capabilities.|$|E
