5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, <b>the</b> <b>rapist</b> was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature {{a case in}} which math was used to solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist case in which police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo to assist them in the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was <b>the</b> <b>rapist,</b> and Comeaux was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was <b>the</b> <b>rapist.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to the {{criminal}} law of China, only females can be victims of rape, {{a man who has}} been raped cannot accuse <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> (who can be men or women) of rape. However, {{the criminal}} law of China had been amended in August 2015 thus males can be victims of indecency, but the articles on the criminal law which are related to rape still remain unrevised, so male rape victims can only accuse <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> of indecency.|$|R

25|$|People {{who have}} been raped can be traumatized and develop {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder. Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

25|$|Sadistic rape usually {{involves}} extensive, prolonged torture and restraint. Sometimes {{it can take}} on ritualistic or other bizarre qualities. <b>The</b> <b>rapist</b> may use some type of instrument or foreign object to penetrate his/her victim.

25|$|Rape {{by gender}} classifies types of rape by the sex or gender of both <b>the</b> <b>rapist</b> and the victim. This scope {{includes}} both rape and sexual assault more generally. Most {{research indicates that}} rape affects women disproportionately, {{with the majority of}} people convicted being men; however, since the broadening of the definition of rape in 2012 by the FBI, more attention is being given to male rape, including females raping males.|$|E
25|$|The final {{allegation}} came in July 1999, when a {{woman was}} raped and Huntley – by now suspected by local police as a serial sex offender – was interviewed. He supplied a DNA sample and had an alibi provided by Maxine Carr to assert his innocence. The woman subsequently said that Huntley was not <b>the</b> <b>rapist.</b> This was the only case where the victim had not identified or named Huntley as the attacker.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} psychological {{injuries to}} the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, sadness, disorientation, isolation, vulnerability, and desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. Causes of death {{as the result of}} sexual violence include suicide and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>rapist</b> or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.|$|E
50|$|Reported {{gang rape}} cases include gang rape of a British tourist in Spain {{where one of}} <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> was a 70-year-old man, and gang rape in Huelva of a 13-year-old girl with mental disability.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} rape {{incidents}} {{in the country is}} showing an increasing trend. It is reported that an average of four women get raped everyday in Malaysia. As <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> are <b>the</b> perpetrators of the crime, it is hoped that an insight into their thoughts, feelings, perception and attitude would help reduce the number of rape incidents in our country. The objectives of the study include obtaining a socio-economic profile of <b>the</b> <b>rapists,</b> understanding <b>the</b> family background of <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> and outlining programmes which can help combat the rise of rape incidences. Through the data obtained, the study intends to outline the profile of a Malaysian rapist. A total of 90 convicted <b>rapists</b> from <b>the</b> above mentioned prisons were interviewed. Majority of the offenders were Malay and were aged between 45 to 55 years old. Our study showed that the most common types of rape were incest and acquaintance rape. The victims were mainly 16 years and below. <b>The</b> Malaysian <b>rapist</b> originates mainly from the rural areas and has low education levels. They are mainly married. In terms of relationship, most of them reported good relationship with their mothers but not their fathers. Their views concerning females in general were degrading and humiliating. These views affected their overall perception and attitudes towards women. Though rape is a violent crime, the responses from <b>the</b> convicted <b>rapists</b> show that they see rape as sex...|$|R
50|$|In the past, Sub-inspector Ramachandran (Delhi Ganesh) was {{an honest}} police officer. He lived happily {{with his two}} daughters : Lakshmi (Vahini) and Raani. One day, he faced the {{smuggler}} Manikkam who severely injured his leg. Lakshmi became a school teacher. Manikkam and his associates Maruthu and Durai spread terror among the villagers. One day, Lakshmi ridiculed and slapped Manikkam. The vengeful Manikkam, Maruthu and Durai raped Lakshmi in her school in broad daylight. Lakshmi, Raani and Ramachandran lodged a complaint against <b>the</b> <b>rapists</b> but <b>the</b> court discharged them. Lakshmi immediately committed suicide in the court. Raani and Ramachandran decided to take revenge on <b>the</b> <b>rapists.</b>|$|R
25|$|Adult {{women were}} often {{extremely}} reluctant {{to bring up}} charges of rape: public admission of having been raped was severely damaging to one's social standing, courts tended to be skeptical of the charges, conviction rates were low, and, {{in the event that}} the accusation could not be proved, the victim could then be accused of committing adultery with <b>the</b> <b>rapist</b> (traditionally a serious offense that could have been punished by mutilation or even death). Certain classes of women, such as prostitutes, were banned from raising accusations of rape altogether.|$|E
25|$|Another {{connection}} between feminism and veganism is the parallel {{of violence against}} women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relates animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers. Hamilton points out that violent “rapists sometimes exhibit behavior {{that seems to be}} patterned on the mutilation of animals” suggesting there is a trend between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by <b>the</b> <b>rapist.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rape {{specific}} adaptation hypothesis {{suggests that}} rape is an evolved behaviour {{because it provides}} direct benefits to <b>the</b> <b>rapist.</b> In this case, the benefit would be a higher chance of reproductive success through increasing mate number. The hypothesis suggests that rape behaviour {{is the result of}} psychological mechanisms designed specifically to influence males to rape, unlike in the by-product hypothesis. This theory suggests that rape by a man which offers no chance of reproductive success, i.e. the rape of any other person who is not a female of reproductive age, is a maladaptive byproduct of this evolutionary adaptation.|$|E
