5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower {{would have been}} a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around the outside of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> would have provided a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese {{development}} of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> around the temple was destroyed. An inner walkway was {{converted into a}} plaza, leaving only a short walkway as a pilgrimage route. In the square, religious objects related to the pilgrimage are sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the {{building}} is a distinctive conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Galleries lead off <b>the</b> <b>walkway,</b> mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} were connected with canopied walkways that extended {{south to the}} dining-hall/old administration building. Steam-pipes ran under <b>the</b> <b>walkways</b> from <b>the</b> boiler-house to heat the four new buildings and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>walkways</b> were almost always clear of ice and snow in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|Grating was {{retrofitted}} {{to prevent}} risk takers {{sliding down the}} 100 ft high girders holding up <b>the</b> <b>walkways.</b> Cast iron grills were erected to stop transit by over-exuberant youths racing bikes and skateboards along <b>the</b> smooth <b>walkway</b> [...] "racetrack". Dogs fouled <b>the</b> <b>walkways,</b> rubbish chutes were blocked, vandals damaged communal bins, stairwells, lifts and multi-storey residential car parks joined the list of problems. The Towers were never widely popular and were demolished in 1987.|$|R
5|$|The station {{received}} a major overhaul after the Østfold Line {{was extended to}} double track in the 1990s. The station was redesigned in the same architectural style as the preceding station Ås, with a modern walkway over the tracks. <b>The</b> <b>walkway</b> is built in gluelam, and shapes together with the stairways down to the platforms one minimalistic construction.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the house there is a further terrace, {{surrounded}} by balustrades with views towards the Pynsent Column.

5|$|A {{few days}} after Noether's death her friends and {{associates}} at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house faces an area of lawn and ornamental shrubbery. To the south east is a pathway to a pergola, {{in front of a}} terrace garden, with a paved walkway through topiary. <b>The</b> <b>walkway</b> leads to a flower garden and beyond to a lawn surrounded by yew hedges with an apse at one end. At {{the other end of the}} pergola is a walkway flanked by lime trees.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> was rebuilt with a wood-plastic {{composite}} {{built by a}} volunteer force. On February 17, 2011, a Bergmann Associates employee used the trestle {{as a case study}} in a seminar on adaptive reuse of defunct railroad bridges. By late March 2011, the estimated cost of renovating the trestle had risen to $1.1million, and the expected time to completion increased to two years.|$|E
5|$|The town {{operates}} a ferry service {{to and from}} the island from about the second week in June through the second week of September. Trails have been laid out for visitors, and {{the western part of the}} island has picnic tables, grills, restrooms, and posted swimming areas. The island is open year round, with a ferry running during the summer. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged the area and washed away <b>the</b> <b>walkway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania {{released}} $700,000 {{to design}} repairs {{on the remaining}} towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor {{at the end of}} the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. <b>The</b> <b>walkway</b> cost $4.3million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5million in tourism revenue for the region.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when Pete Rose tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate umpire when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre. The manager became angry {{at the end of a}} game and followed West into <b>the</b> <b>walkway</b> outside the umpires dressing room. West then shoved Torre. On appeal, NL President Chub Feeney reduced West's fine to $300. Torre also received a fine stemming from the incident.|$|E
