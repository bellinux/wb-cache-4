5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too little and <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> <b>In</b> May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of}} the 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E

5|$|Reenlisted {{prisoners of}} war formed a large section of the {{approximately}} 30,800 former Austria-Hungarian citizens who were registered as active on the Romanian side by late 1917. By the time it stopped recruiting (January 1918), the Corps had enlisted some 8,500 to 10,000 men. However, the Kornilov order came <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the war for there {{to have been a}} more significant Transylvanian-Bukovinan contribution to the Romanian effort.|$|E

5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the day to proceed.|$|E

5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> life {{to become a}} truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland <b>too.</b> <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He {{found it difficult to}} believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals seemed to know in advance which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft zone defense instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E
5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} their story {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created unanswered questions of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Vortigaunts {{were planned}} to begin Half-Life as enemy non-player characters, which the player {{has to win}} over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved {{impractical}} and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries. The plan re-emerged for Half-Life 2, in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2 were originally going to be fully integrated in City 17 alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game {{taking place in the}} countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to hint at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game. Midway through Half-Life 2, the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, but it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in Episode Two. The concept was later showcased in an Episode Two trailer shown at the Games Convention in 2006.|$|E
