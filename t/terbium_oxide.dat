40|$|This thesis {{describes}} crystallographic, magnetic {{and electrical}} studies of some mixed metal perovskites. In the first part, the charge distribution, magnetic and electrical properties of mixed metal rhodium-copper perovskite oxides were investigated. Various {{series with the}} general formula Ln 1 -yAyRh 1 - 2 xCuxBxO 3 in which (Ln = La 3 +, Tb 3 +; A = Ca 2 +, Sr 2 +, Pb 2 +, Bi 3 +; B = Sc 3 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +; y ≤ 0. 3, x ≤ 0. 25), have been synthesised by solid state reaction, and characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and physical property measurements and, as available, neutron diffraction and X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements. Structures were invariably orthorhombic with space group Pbnm with the Rh and Cu ions disordered on the same site. X-ray diffraction measurements of selected samples showed that the orthorhombic structure persisted over a wide temperature range, 30 to 900 ºC. All the samples are semiconductors and paramagnetic over the temperature range 4 - 300 K. Doping a divalent cation onto the B site {{appears to have a}} significant impact on charge delocalization between Rh 3 +/ 4 + and Cu 2 +/ 3 + ions due to the oxidation of Rh 3 + to Rh 4 + required to maintain the overall charge. That was most evident from the Rh L 3 XANES measurements of the LaRh 1 - 2 xCu 2 xO 3 and La 1 -xPbxRh 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 O 3 series. Powder neutron diffraction measurements of La 0. 75 Pb 0. 25 Rh 0. 5 Cu 0. 25 Zn 0. 25 O 3, LaRh 0. 5 Cu 0. 25 Zn 0. 25 O 3 and La 0. 75 Pb 0. 25 Rh 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 O 3 show no evidence for anion vacancies and it is postulated the oxides do not contain appreciable amount of oxygen vacancies. The magnetization curves show negative values for Weiss constants indicating weak antiferromagnetism may be present but there is no indication for long range coupling in the oxides. There are several factors that may influence the magnitude of the cell volume, octahedral distortion, octahedral tilting, magnetic interactions and electronic properties. These include ionic size, effective charge, electron configuration and electronegativity. In addition the charge delocalization and local ordering effects can play a role. The present work has demonstrated that: The changes in the unit cell volume and the octahedral distortion of the isovalent doped oxides such as La 0. 75 A 0. 25 Rh 0. 7 Cu 0. 3 O 3 where A = Ca 2 +, Sr 2 + and Pb 2 + are consistent with the increase in the ionic radii, whereas the decrease in magnetic moments of these is correlated with the increase in the electronegativities of the dopant cation. The unit cell volumes for the <b>terbium</b> <b>oxides</b> are somewhat smaller than found in the analogous lanthanum oxides reflecting the small ionic size of Tb 3 +. The divalent cation doped oxides LnRh 1 - 2 xCu 2 xO 3 and LnRh 1 - 2 xCuxZnxO 3 display lower cell volumes and octahedral distortions but higher magnetic moments and electrical conductivities than the trivalent cation doped oxides LnRh 1 - 2 xCuxScxO 3 as consequence of charge delocalization. The electrical conductivity of the oxides increases as the divalent dopant content increases possibly because of an increase in carrier concentration that occurs as consequences of the formation of ionic defects due to the oxidation of Rh 3 + (3 d 6) to Rh 4 + (3 d 5). The electron configuration influences the spin coupling and the band gap and this is most evident in the Pb 2 + and Bi 3 + (6 s 2) doped LaRh 1 - 2 xCu 2 xO 3 oxides which exhibited the lowest magnetic moments and the highest activation energies among the oxides studied. Compared with the analogous lanthanum oxides, the magnetic susceptibilities of the <b>terbium</b> <b>oxides</b> increased as a consequence of the contribution of Tb 3 + 4 f 8 electrons. Changing the A site composition resulted in anomalous changes in the cell volumes, octahedral distortions, electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility of the La 1 -xPbxRh 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 O 3 and La 1 -xBixRh 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 O 3 perovskites. This is likely a consequence of charge delocalization and short-range local ordering effects. Increasing the doping on the B-site resulted in either a decrease or increase in the cell volumes and the magnetic moments, depending on the dopant type cation. The final part of this thesis describes the structure of some Ba 2 -xSr 1 +xBO 5. 5 (B = Nb 5 + and Ta 5 +) perovskites. These were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray and neutron diffraction. The preparation of these used solid state methods but the initial reactions were conducted under different media. Four compounds were prepared and these all have a face centred cubic structure with space group Fm 3 ̅m. The two synthetic methods produce monophasic powders and these differ in color, particle size, and hardness. The cell edges of the oxides obtained by mixing the reactants with water are larger than these obtained when the mixing was conducted with acetone. The neutron diffraction profiles demonstrate that the A cation and oxygen ions are disordered in the BaSr 2 NbO 5. 5 and BaSr 2 TaO 5. 5 structures. The unusual thermal expansion of the unit cell is due to the presences of water and anion deficiency into the oxides structure. The oxides were found to absorb CO 2 atmosphere during storage...|$|R

30|$|Lanthanide {{nanomaterials}} {{are considered}} a less toxic alternative to quantum dots for bioimaging applications. This study evaluated the cytotoxicity of <b>terbium</b> (Tb)-doped gadolinium <b>oxide</b> (Gd 2 O 3) and dysprosium oxide (Dy 2 O 3) nanoparticles exposed to human (BEAS- 2 B) and mouse (L 929) cell lines at a concentration range of 200 – 2000 (μg/ml for 48 h. Two assay methods were utilized—WST- 8 assay (colorimetric) based on mitochondrial metabolic activity and Pico-Green assay (fluorescence), which measures total DNA content. The authors' data showed that Tb-doped Gd 2 O 3 nanoparticles were consistently more toxic than Tb-doped Dy 2 O 3 nanoparticles. However, exposure to these nanomaterials caused a decrease in proliferation rate for both cell lines rather than {{a net loss of}} viable cells after 48 h of exposure. Additionally, there was some degree of discrepancy observed with the two assay methods. For the mouse L 929 cell line, the WST- 8 assay yielded consistently lower proliferation rates compared to the Pico-Green assay, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the human BEAS- 2 B cell line. This could arise because of the differential effects of these nanoparticles on the metabolism of L 929 and BEAS- 2 B cells, which in turn may translate to differences in their postexposure proliferation rates. Hence, the Pico-Green assay could have an advantage over the WST- 8 assay because it is not skewed by the differential effects of nanomaterials on cellular metabolism.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} use of silicate glasses doped with <b>terbium</b> <b>oxide</b> (Tb 2 O 3) {{is their}} use as fiber optic sensors for high-resolution imaging applications requiring {{the detection of}} x-rays (e. g. tomography and radiography). The x-ray radiation is absorbed by the glass, producing electron-hole pairs (excitons). The excitons migrate through the glass matrix and then recombine, emitting characteristic Tb(3 +) luminescence in the optical wavelength region. This emission is due to forbidden transitions of 4 f electrons and therefore has a long decay time. Long decay time is undesirable when imaging transient events since it results in blurring in time of the images. It has been reported elsewhere that in crystals Tb(3 +) ions can act both as luminescence centers and as fluorescence traps. These traps can capture excitons and delay their recombination. This delayed fluorescence {{is seen as a}} long lived, secondary component to the luminescence decay curve, or afterglow.

Influence of oxygen partial pressure in the inert gas on thermal reduction of TbO 2 and effect of water splitting temperature (TL) on Gibbs free energy related to the H 2 production step were examined in detail. The cycle (ηcycle) and solar-to-fuel energy conversion (ηsolar-to-fuel) efficiency of the Tb-WS cycle were determined by performing the second-law thermodynamic analysis. Results obtained indicate that ηcycle and ηsolar-to-fuel increase with the decrease in oxygen partial pressure in the inert flushing gas and thermal reduction temperature (TH).

It is also inexpensive and environmentally safe. Zinc oxide, electrically excited, emits in the blue/green spectral region. By Stark effect, rare earths doped ZnO emits in the red (Eu 3 +) and the yellow spectrum (Tb 3 +). The result is a white light resulting from the recombination of these three emissions created in the ZnO matrix. The intended application is the manufacture of a light-emitting diode LED based on rare earth doped zinc oxide (RE : ZnO) emitting white light. In the present study, rare earth (Eu / Tb) doped ZnO thin films were grown by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering using a ZnO target.
