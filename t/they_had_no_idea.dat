5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those {{who were members of}} Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, {{the voice of the}} game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their own style and personality.|$|E

25|$|Under cross examination, Montagnier {{stated that}} it is {{possible}} to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of the cause of the epidemic's spread.|$|E

25|$|Eraserheads went onstage {{for their}} reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at The Fort Open Field, Taguig City. The concert, however, {{was cut short}} halfway through a planned 30-song setlist as Buendia {{was rushed to the}} Makati Medical Hospital after {{experiencing}} chest pains. He was reported to be in stable condition. Buddy Zabala had checked on Buendia in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Buendia on an ambulance. Bandmates Zabala, Marasigan and Adoro further said that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that Buendia was already having difficulty performing. In the spirit of the reunion, Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro went to Saguijo after the concert and they continued their sets there. Kris Gorra-Dancel, Ebe Dancel, Aia De Leon and many other OPM artists joined them as well. During the concert, Jazz Nicolas of the Itchyworms and a close friend of the band, also joined the band and played synths, keyboards, and other back-up instruments.|$|E

He told his {{collaborators}} to do a remake of his previous single, [...] "Cry Me a River". Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: [...] "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' {{and not in the}} sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [...] to sound." ...|$|E
500|$|The VNQDD then {{established}} their national headquarters in Hanoi, {{and began to}} publish newspapers, expounding their policies and explaining their ideology. The OSS agent Archimedes Patti, who was based in Kunming and northern Vietnam, reported that the VNQDD were [...] "hopelessly disoriented politically" [...] and felt that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of {{how to run a}} government. He speculated that the VNQDD were driven by [...] "desires for personal power and economic gain". Giap accused them of being [...] "bandits". Military and newspaper attacks between the groups occurred regularly, but a power-sharing agreement was put in place until the elections occurred in order to end the attacks and strengthen national unity to further the goal of independence. The communists also allowed the VNQDD to continue printing material.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what to do}} with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Streif {{was sent}} {{out on a}} mission to Trøndelag, with an agent and supplies. The crew were that of the Harald, which had an engine failure.

After some days they managed to start the engine again, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> [...] where they were. One day they saw a British plane, and flashed a signal.
