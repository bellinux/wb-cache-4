5|$|In 1926, <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> {{government}} {{attempted to}} have the Italian national flag redesigned by having the fasces, the symbol used by <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> movement, included in the flag. However, this attempt by <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> government to change the Italian flag to incorporate the fasces was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> government raised the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag in public ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Some, {{including}} most persistently <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> journalist Giorgio Pisanò, {{have claimed that}} Mussolini and Petacci were shot {{earlier in the day}} near the De Maria farmhouse and that the execution at Giulino de Mezzegra was staged with corpses. The first to put this forward was Franco Bandini in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death as proof that Tuđman's government had revived <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E
50|$|Thenceforth, the Fasci di Combattimento (forerunner of <b>the</b> National <b>Fascist</b> Party, 1921) of Benito Mussolini {{successfully}} {{exploited the}} claims of Italian nationalists {{and the quest for}} order and normalization of the middle class. In 1920, old Prime Minister Giolitti was reappointed {{in a desperate attempt to}} solve Italy's deadlock, but his cabinet was weak and threatened by a growing socialist opposition. Giolitti believed that <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> could be toned down and used to protect the monarchy from the socialists. He decided to include Fascists on his electoral list for 1921 elections. In <b>the</b> elections, <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> did not make large gains, but Giolitti's government failed to gather a large enough coalition to govern and offered <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> placements in his government. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists</b> rejected Giolitti's offers and joined with socialists in bringing down his government.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 October 1922, a {{party with}} similar {{policies}} and objectives came into power in Italy, <b>the</b> National <b>Fascist</b> Party under <b>the</b> leadership of the charismatic Benito Mussolini. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists,</b> like <b>the</b> Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country; opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the Treaty of Versailles; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. <b>The</b> Italian <b>Fascists</b> used a straight-armed Roman salute and wore black-shirted uniforms. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and <b>the</b> <b>Fascists,</b> borrowing {{their use of the}} straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute. When <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> came to power in 1922 in Italy through their coup attempt called the [...] "March on Rome", Hitler began planning his own coup.|$|R
25|$|These basic {{political}} views and principles {{formed the basis}} of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista in 1914, who called themselves Fascisti (Fascists). At this time, <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists. Antagonism between the interventionists, including <b>the</b> <b>Fascists,</b> versus <b>the</b> anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> and socialists. <b>The</b> opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> and other interventionists were so violent that even democratic socialists who opposed the war such as Anna Kuliscioff said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> and <b>the</b> revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.|$|R
5|$|Later, when Rosier has an {{accident}} outside the village, he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. He sells them his father's house, {{in order to}} protect them from <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi enrolls the children in her school. The freedom-loving Romani recognize that these French are trying to help but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was {{widely seen as}} the {{embodiment}} of the sovereign oppressive centralism and <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{popular music}} {{began in the}} late 19th century, with {{international}} styles influencing Italian music by the late 1910s; however, the rise of autarchia, <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> policy of cultural isolationism in 1922 led to a retreat from international popular music. During this period, popular Italian musicians traveled abroad and learned elements of jazz, Latin American music and other styles. These musics influenced the Italian tradition, which spread around the world and further diversified following liberalization after World War II.|$|E
50|$|Players are {{secretly}} {{divided into}} two teams: liberals and <b>fascists.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fascists</b> are known {{to each other and}} know which player is Hitler, but the Hitler player does not know the identity of <b>the</b> <b>fascists</b> in games with 7 or more players.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries {{escalated}} {{their strategy}} {{from one of}} attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists</b> met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists</b> attacked <b>the</b> headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano. After seizing these cities, <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> made plans to take Rome.|$|R

5|$|The {{anniversary of}} Mussolini's death on 28 April {{has become one}} of three dates neo-fascist {{supporters}} mark with major rallies. In Predappio, a march takes place between the centre of town and the cemetery. The event usually attracts supporters in the thousands and includes speeches, songs and people giving <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> salute.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as to what to commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E
5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> governments of Germany and Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were not finished until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but ethnically diverse, border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses {{an extension of the}} cemetery designs of the 1920s, celebrating a natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries {{escalated}} {{their strategy}} {{from one of}} attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists</b> met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several cities, including Bologna, Bolzano, Cremona, Ferrara, Fiume, and Trent. <b>The</b> <b>Fascists</b> attacked <b>the</b> headquarters of socialist and Catholic unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.

50|$|Other symbols used by <b>the</b> Italian <b>Fascists</b> {{included}} <b>the</b> aquila, the Capitoline Wolf, and the SPQR motto, each {{related to}} Italy's ancient Roman cultural history, which <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> attempted to resurrect.|$|R
5|$|After {{attending}} a public celebration of HSS leader Vladko Maček's birthday on 20 June 1935, Blažeković was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve {{days in a}} prison {{on the island of}} Korčula. He was subsequently taken to Dubrovnik and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state, but was not convicted. In 1939, he joined the Ustaše, a Croatian fascist organization which advocated armed struggle in achieving Croatia's independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, he came into contact with <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> leader Slavko Kvaternik. From late 1940 to early 1941, Blažeković was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Ustaše and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|Fascism {{has been}} {{prescribed}} dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after {{the defeat of}} fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{went on to}} pen {{a string}} of Adventures of Tintin, sending his {{character}} to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> state Borduria—whose leader, Müsstler, {{was a combination of}} Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.|$|E
50|$|While the RSI {{supported}} the Nazi Germany, it allowed <b>the</b> Italian <b>Fascist</b> movement {{to build a}} completely totalitarian state. During the preceding twenty years of <b>Fascist</b> association with <b>the</b> Savoy monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy, <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> had been restricted in some of their actions by the monarchy. The formation of the RSI allowed Mussolini to at last be the official head of an Italian state, and it allowed <b>the</b> <b>Fascists</b> {{to return to their}} earlier republican stances.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>fascists</b> {{idealized}} association {{football for}} {{its contribution to}} physical fitness, {{it was also seen}} at the time as an [...] "English game" [...] (because the rules had been codified by the English Football Association and the first organized matches had taken place in England). <b>The</b> <b>fascists</b> generally distanced themselves from cultural practices with foreign roots.|$|R

5|$|In 1933, Quisling {{left the}} Farmers' Party and founded <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> party Nasjonal Samling. Although he {{achieved}} some popularity after his {{attacks on the}} political left, his party failed to win any seats in the Storting and by 1940 it was still little more than peripheral. On 9 April 1940, with the German invasion of Norway in progress, he attempted to seize power in the world's first radio-broadcast coup d'état, but failed after the Germans refused to support his government.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, <b>the</b> <b>Fascist</b> governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} 1st Army {{were able}} to cross the Danube and began to prepare defences.

On the night of 10/11 April, the whole 2nd Army Group continued its withdrawal, but units of the 2nd Army on the left flank of the 1st Army that included significant numbers of Croats began to dissolve due to the fifth column activities of <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> Ustaše and their sympathisers.|$|E
5|$|The re-interment in the Mussolini family crypt in Predappio {{was carried}} out on 1 September 1957, with {{supporters}} present giving <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> salute. Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus. The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini. In front of the tomb is a register for visitors paying their respects to sign. The tomb has become a neo-fascist place of pilgrimage. The numbers signing the tomb's register range from dozens to hundreds per day, with thousands signing on certain anniversaries; almost all the comments left are supportive of Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|A search began for a {{suitable}} Serb {{to lead a}} collaborationist regime. From {{the date of the}} Yugoslav capitulation, pro-German politicians, including the president of <b>the</b> <b>fascist</b> Zbor movement, Dimitrije Ljotić, former Belgrade police chief and Minister of the Interior, Milan Aćimović, the current Belgrade police chief, Dragomir Jovanović, Đorđe Perić, Steven Klujić and Tanasije Dinić met almost daily to assist in this process. Several high-profile men were considered by the Germans, including former Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković, former Foreign Minister Aleksander Cincar-Marković, Aćimović, Ljotić, and Jovanović. Förster decided on Aćimović, who in early 1939 had briefly been Minister of the Interior in the pro-Axis government of Milan Stojadinović. He formed his Commissioner Government on 30 April 1941, consisting of ten commissioners.|$|E
