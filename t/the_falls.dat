5|$|Due to {{extremely}} {{cold winter}} temperatures, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last {{well into the}} spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.|$|E
5|$|Kitchen Creek {{flows through}} the park's three glens, which the {{descriptions}} of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen. <b>The</b> <b>falls</b> are listed in order going upstream along Kitchen Creek, starting with the southernmost and ending at the northernmost in each glen. This is also {{the order in which}} a hiker would encounter <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> while traveling north along the creek on <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> Trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly wiped out <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> The geological {{formation of the}} area consisted of a hard, thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> <b>The</b> <b>falls</b> were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500. Possibly {{as a result of the}} bonding needed to rehabilitate <b>the</b> <b>falls,</b> the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on April 9, 1872.|$|E

5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The snails occupied {{an area of}} 53.7m2 {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>Falls,</b> with most snails found in an area of 11.4m2. More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4m from the eastern edge of <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> and extending to 16m from <b>the</b> <b>Falls.</b> In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{can be found on the}} middle ledge 4m above the primary ledge and in the talus as far as 3m downslope from the primary ledge.|$|E
5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E

5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed.

5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms {{out over the water}} and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E
5|$|Glen Leigh {{has eight}} named waterfalls in 0.64miles (1.03km). It is 1.8miles (2.9km) from PA 118 {{in the south}} to Waters Meet and the {{southern}} end of Glen Leigh. The glen is also accessible from the north; it is 1.04miles (1.67km) from the Lake Leigh trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Onondaga, the northernmost waterfall. The Highland Trail is the 1.2-mile (1.9km) path between the northern ends of Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen. It meets <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> Trail just north of Onondaga Falls and has a short connector to F. L.

5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of <b>the</b> <b>Falls.</b> However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest <b>the</b> <b>Falls.</b> Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E

5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred at or near <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E

5|$|To {{continue}} economic {{use of the}} river, {{civic leaders}} pushed for plans to build locks and dams, making the Mississippi River navigable above Saint Anthony Falls for the first time. Congressional approval for the Upper Minneapolis Harbor Development Project came in 1937 but it wasn't until 1950 through 1963, that the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed two sets of locks at the lower dam and at <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> They also covered <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> with a permanent concrete apron.

5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to <b>the</b> <b>falls,</b> built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E
