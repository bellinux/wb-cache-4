5|$|With the English Reformation and the {{breaking}} of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and <b>teaching</b> <b>was</b> neglected.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's <b>teaching</b> <b>was</b> the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
5|$|After {{training}} as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because <b>teaching</b> <b>was</b> a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship to Harvard {{in his second year}} (1954), becoming a friend of the future Senator Ted Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all <b>teaching</b> <b>was</b> on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E
5|$|King's {{was divided}} into a senior {{department}} and a junior department, also known as King's College School, which was originally situated {{in the basement of}} the Strand Campus. The Junior department started with 85 pupils and only three teachers, but quickly grew to 500 by 1841, outgrowing its facilities and leading it to relocate to Wimbledon in 1897 where it remains today, though it is no longer associated with King's College London. Within the Senior department <b>teaching</b> <b>was</b> divided into three courses: a general course comprised divinity, classical languages, mathematics, English literature and history; a medical course; and miscellaneous subjects, such as law, political economy and modern languages, which were not related to any systematic course of study at the time and depended for their continuance on the supply of occasional students. In 1833 the general course was reorganised leading to the award of the Associate of King's College (AKC), the first qualification issued by King's. The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today to students and staff who take an optional three-year course alongside their studies.|$|E

40|$|Much of the self-image of the Western {{university}} {{hangs on}} the idea that research and <b>teaching</b> <b>are</b> intimately connected. The central axiom here is that research and <b>teaching</b> <b>are</b> mutually supportive of each other. An institution lacking such a set of relationships between research and teaching falls short {{of what it means to}} be a university. This set of beliefs raises certain questions: Is it the case that the presence of such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the idea of the university? (A conceptual question). And is it true that, in practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research and teaching characterises universities? (An empirical question). In my talk, I want to explore these matters in a critical vein. I shall suggest that: a) In practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> in jeopardy. Far from supporting each other, very often research and teaching contend against each other. Research and <b>teaching</b> <b>are</b> becoming two separate ideologies, with their own interest structures. b) Historically, the supposed tight link between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> both of recent origin and far from universally achieved in universities. Institutional separateness between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> and has been evident, both across institutions and even across departments in the same institution. c) Conceptually, research and <b>teaching</b> <b>are</b> different activities: each is complex and neither is reducible to the other. In theory, therefore, research and <b>teaching</b> may <b>be</b> said to constitute a holy alliance but in practice, we see more of an unholy alliance. If, then, in an ideal world, a positive relationship between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> still a worthwhile goal, how might it be construed and worked for? Seeing research and teaching as two discrete and unified sets of activity is now inadequate. Much better is a construal of research and teaching as themselves complexes, as intermingling pools of activity helping to form the liquid university that is emerging today. On this view, research and <b>teaching</b> <b>are</b> fluid spaces, ever on the move, taking up new shapes, and themselves dividing and reforming, as the university reworks its own destiny in modern society. On such a perspective, working out a productive relationship between research and <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> a complex project. This is an alliance that is neither holy nor unholy. It is an uneasy alliance, with temporary accommodations and continuous new possibilitie...|$|R
