40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the institution <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> {{in the legal}} order of the Czech Republic {{in comparison with the}} canon law of the Catholic Church. The first part specifies legal adjustments <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in the Civil Code and the Code of Canon Law. Moreover, attributes and purpose <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and the rights and responsibilities of spouses are described. The second part discusses the origin <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> and also the relationship between civil and religious marriages. Following sections examine invalid and void marriage. In conclusion, case studies <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> are compared. Canon law does not compete with secular law; in the Czech Republic, canonical matrimonial law is legally irrelevant to the secular law.

25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if {{even one}} of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict.

40|$|AbstractThe current Romanian Civil Code is {{characterized}} mainly {{by the fact}} that it is a monistic code, applicable to both civil and commercial relations, as well as to family law. The filiation towards the father (the paternity) is one of the family law institutions, which gains a new configuration within the current regulation. In this respect, this study analyzes the presumptions applicable to paternity, some of them regarding marital paternity, while others envisage extra-marital paternity. Thus, the marital paternity presumption is found in the new code in a simplified formula that unites under its legal protection both the children born in wedlock, as well as those conceived during marriage but born after the cancellation, dissolution or <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> In addition, the current code establishes a new presumption of paternity – that of the child born out of wedlock, this presumption being designed to facilitate probation for establishing the paternity of the child born out of a marital relationship...|$|E

40|$|Community {{property}} of spouses - termination and settlement The topic of my thesis is called Community property between spouses, its termination and settlement. I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important. Community {{property of}} spouses is a specific type of property partnership, which can exist only between spouses. The community property of spouses origins and terminates together with the marriage.

The thesis is composed of six chapters which further include under-chapters and sections. At the beginning there is an introduction into the history and development of the legal regulations of community property of spouses. Attention is given to the great amendment of the Civil Code carried into affect by Act No. 91 / 1998 Coll., which has brought many changes into the legal regulations of community property of spouses.

40|$|A divorce {{as one of}} {{the forms}} of <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> is enacted in all European laws, being defined as abolishment of an {{existing}} marriage during the life of the spouses, pronounced by a competent state body, on the grounds stipulated by the law and within the framework of a prescribed procedural process, with effect ex nunc. One of the characteristics of the current European society is a so-called "family crisis". A manifestation of this crisis is a growing number of unmarried couples and, first of all, a continuously growing number of divorces. A divorce as a social situation became {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium an ordinary and acceptable issue for an overwhelming majority of the society, being considered to be an accessible, decisive and effective method for resolving disputes and problems in a marriage. In this respect, the current European legislation also leads to the fact that only a small proportion of divorces today ends by settlement between the partners. However, it is certainly unadvisable to overestimate the importance of the institute of marriage. As regards the general opinion, the law on divorce cannot be made so complicated that it would force the spouses to remain in a non-functional and de facto nonexistent union.

40|$|The idea {{of writing}} and signing prenuptial {{agreements}} is not a recent one in Common Law countries, both legally and culturally. Women {{have always wanted to}} make sure that they would not find themselves homeless in case of divorce or death of their spouse (Stoner / Irving 2008 : 1 - 2). Prenuptial, antenuptial, or premarital agreements are contracts signed in contemplation of divorce for protection against post-nuptial disagreements to handle the financial aspects of marriage. More precisely, they are stipulated in order to “describe the rights, duties and obligations of prospective spouses during and upon <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> through death or divorce” (Greenstein 1992). Throughout history there have been several examples of contracts of this type. In Ireland, for example, a Celtic institution foresaw that men and women had to contribute an equal amount from their own property and they had to keep account of the profits of their conjoint resources, suggesting that each reserved ultimate ownership of what was contributed to the marital fund (Ó Corráin 1985 : 5 - 24). The present study, which is part of an ongoing work on prenuptial agreement discourse, aims at carrying out a diachronic analysis of prenups in Common Law countries. The link between ancient dowries and modern prenups runs across centuries of history, different countries and legal systems, but also procedures and practices modified according to customs and needs. This study will start by investigating the emergence and evolution of dowries in Europe and in England. Then, it will focus on the analysis of the first marriage settlements, those contemplating dowry, dower, jointure and pin money, up to the modern American prenups...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{encourage}} the Turkish courts to eliminate their presumption against the enforcement of joint custody judgments, a presumption which is based on public policy grounds, so that these judgments are enforced in appropriate circumstances. As the number <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> between Turkish and foreign nationals increases, more international family law conflicts will come into the picture. The <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> by divorce brings with it many problems, among which custody of the children has great importance. Joint custody decisions are an important type of custody decisions, and the Turkish courts' approach to such decisions needs to be analysed from an international perspective. It is recommended that the Turkish Courts change their tendency to argue that custody is a subject which is directly connected to public policy and that foreign joint custody judgments cannot be enforced in Turkey since, under Turkish Civil Law, joint custody is not accepted. Our main conclusion is that, in cases where the parents are able to communicate effectively and to collaborate in a civilized manner for the sake of their child, and considering that such co-operation is in the interests of the child, public policy intervention should not occur, and the foreign joint custody judgment should be enforced. © The Author 2013.
