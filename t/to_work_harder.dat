Bute had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> to maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various levers of influence at his disposal. He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder,</b> and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder.</b> Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E

A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder,</b> and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

25|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} (AI), {{also known}} as aortic regurgitation (AR), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle.

25|$|Groups {{also affect}} {{performance}} and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, {{is a tendency}} <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> and faster {{in the presence of}} others. Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.|$|E

25|$|Austrian Poles {{experienced}} an enormous rise in religiosity {{during the late}} 19th century. From 1875 to 1914, the number of Polish nuns increased sixfold in Galicia; at the same time, German Poland had a less marked increase and in Russian Poland it decreased. Historian William Galush noted that many nuns were from the peasant class, and young women choosing marriage were {{faced with the prospect}} of hard farm work. Polish peasants in Galicia were forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> on smaller size farms than those they had grown up on as a result of Poland's rapid population growth.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{walls were}} lowered {{dramatically}} during the war, especially informal policies against hiring women, minorities, and workers over 45 or under 18. (See FEPC) Strikes (except in coal mining) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder.</b> Tens {{of thousands of}} new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Fujita became {{interested}} in joining the military after hearing of his friend's enjoyment of the Texas National Guard. He enlisted after a lengthy debate between the National Guard and the civics teacher of {{the local high school}} debating the legitimacy of his claim to American citizenship, as well as questions over his weight, height and age, all three of which were below the minimum level. Made a PFC and a chauffeur for the battalion officers, Fujita progressed well in the National Guard though struggled at home with his studies. After accepting an ultimatum from his father <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> or leave, Fujita chose to hitch-hike to Oklahoma and became an artist and illustrator. On the outbreak of war in 1939, he returned to his National Guard unit, taking part in training manoeuvres through 1940.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|Intensive therapy can be {{alternatively}} {{characterized by}} {{the magnitude of the}} demands placed on a client within a session. Under this definition, intensive therapy includes a few specific techniques such as Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT) and Speech Intensive Rehabilitation Intervention (SP-I-R-IT). CIAT places high demands on the patient by restricting use of the strongest areas of the patient’s brain and requiring the weakest areas <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder.</b> Typical CIAT therapy sessions are intense and last for about 3 hours. One study found that when given intensive CIAT therapy, participant performance in verbal communication in everyday life significantly improved. Each participant in the study also showed improvement on at least one subtest within the Aachen Aphasia Test; which assesses language performance and comprehension in aphasia patients. These results suggest that intensive CIAT therapy is effective in patients with moderate, fluent aphasias in the chronic stage of recovery. SP-I-R-IT focuses heavily on speech production strategies and intervention. SPIRIT therapy {{has been found to be}} effective; patients participating in intensive SPIRIT therapy improved performance on standardized measures by 15% after 50 weeks of therapy.|$|E
