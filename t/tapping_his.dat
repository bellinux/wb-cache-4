25|$|The book {{became an}} {{immediate}} bestseller but also prompted a vicious backlash from General Motors (GM) {{who attempted to}} discredit Nader by <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> phone {{in an attempt to}} uncover salacious information and, when that failed, hiring prostitutes in an attempt to catch him in a compromising situation. Nader, by then working as an unpaid consultant to United States Senator Abe Ribicoff, reported to the senator that he suspected he was being followed. Ribicoff convened an inquiry that called GM CEO James Roche who admitted, when placed under oath, that the company had hired a private detective agency to investigate Nader. Nader sued GM for invasion of privacy, settling the case for $425,000 and using the proceeds to found the activist organization the Center for the Study of Responsive Law.|$|E
25|$|Not {{knowing how}} to play or compose music did not stop António from making music by himself. He would, using a tape recorder, {{mimicking}} sounds and rhythms while he sang, using his own voice or even <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> hands on different objects. These recordings were then used by his supporting studio musicians {{as the basis for}} the song arrangements. Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from synthesizers, to Portuguese and classical guitars, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: something between Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.|$|E

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, [...] "like Rock 'n' Roll, John Lennon's 1975 {{album of}} primal rock gems, Kisses on the Bottom {{is the sound}} of a {{musician}} joyfully <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> roots; and like his former song writing partner, McCartney is better transforming influences than mirroring them. But it's fun, and touching, to hear him crooning his way through the great American songbook." [...] In a review of the album for BBC Music, writer Patrick Humphries referred to the collection as [...] "an album of neglected dishes from the great banquet of American popular music", before concluding that [...] "what McCartney accomplishes here, in the best possible sense, is an album ideally made for Easy Listening".|$|E

Clive Davis was <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> {{foot and}} <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> very {{expensive}} pen on his very expensive desk. He said [...] "Yeah, that's great man". Steve said [...] "So {{you like the}} tape, Clive". Steve then stopped the tape, ejected it and said [...] "WELL YOU CAN'T FUCKING HAVE IT!" [...] The story that Steve told me {{was that it would}} have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn't up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That's why the Mijits never came out at that point in time. It's been gathering dust for ages" [...] – Jim Leverton.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{his release}} in 1954 and 1960, Claudian {{worked as a}} {{researcher}} at the Romanian Academy's Iași chapter, leading a withdrawn life at his house on Copou Hill, or at his friend Mircea Spiridoneanu's home, and often rejoining Zoe in Bucharest. From 1957, the Securitate police opened a file on him, worried about his nighttime contacts with PSDI militants, some of whom were its own informers. These suspected him of [...] "subverting the state" [...] and of promoting a [...] "Western political regime", but were unable to penetrate his innermost circle of friends, and considered <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> telephone.|$|E
2500|$|George Frazier of Life {{magazine}} found Berlin to be [...] "intensely nervous," [...] with a {{habit of}} <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back" [...] and [...] "picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal." [...] While listening, [...] "he leans forward tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell.... For {{a man who has}} known so much glory," [...] writes Frazier, [...] "Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Built {{around a}} call-and-response dynamic between the vocalist and band, [...] ""Black Dog"'s {{start and stop}} a cappella verses were {{inspired}} by Fleetwood Mac's 1969 song [...] "Oh Well." [...] But Jones has claimed he wrote down the song's basic riff {{on the way to}} a rehearsal at Jimmy Page's Pangbourne boathouse, on the back of a train ticket in 1968. Although it has an apparently simple drum pattern, the song's complex, shifting time signature was intended to thwart cover bands from playing the song. Jones originally wanted the song recorded in 6/8 time but realised it was too complex to reproduce live. In live performances, John Bonham eliminated the 5/4 variation so that Plant could perform his a cappella vocal interludes and then have the instruments return together synchronised. If the volume is turned up loud enough, Bonham can be heard <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> sticks together before each riff. Page explained this in an interview with Guitar World magazine in 1993: ...|$|E

2500|$|On the day {{of atomic}} testing, the {{military}} and public policy makers, lawmakers and legislators, senior journalists, and the influential members of the civil society at the Parliament strongly chaired for the tests, loud slogans and songs of [...] "Pakistan Zindabad" [...] (long live Pakistan) were sung, and the tribute to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was heavily paid by the parliamentarians from all political parties of Pakistan. The parliamentarians and the Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto had also congratulated prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Armed Forces thanking for making its [...] "bold decision" [...] in spite of whatever the economical outcomes were. Political scientist and geostrategist Javed Hashmi was clearly heard saying: [...] "Yes! Yes!.... We have done it.", while he was <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> parliament desk. The Peoples Party also chaired this moment when Ameen Faheem was heard saying: [...] "We gave the same medicines to [...]". On its effects on India, the politicians in Indian parliament erupted into shouting as opposition leaders blamed the government for starting a nuclear arms race.|$|E
2500|$|Because Goldwater {{had done}} well in the Deep South, delegates to the 1968 Republican National Convention would be more Southern and {{conservative}} than past conventions. There was a real possibility that the conservative Reagan would be nominated {{if there was no}} victor on the first ballot. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot, with the aid of South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, who had switched parties in 1964. He selected dark horse Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats. It was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally [...] Robert Finch, who was the Lieutenant Governor of California at the time. Finch declined that offer, [...] but would later serve as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in Nixon's Administration. With Vietnam also a key issue, Nixon strongly considered <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> 1960 running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr, who was a former U.S. Senator, Ambassador to the UN, and Ambassador twice to South Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As [...] "In Dreams" [...] was {{released}} in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them and, annoyed, asked rhetorically, [...] "What's a Beatle anyway?" [...] to which John Lennon replied, after <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, [...] "I am". On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting [...] "We want Roy!" [...] again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back. Starr later said, [...] "In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything." [...] Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.|$|E
