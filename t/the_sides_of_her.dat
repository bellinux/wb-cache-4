500|$|The {{brothers}} Asa and Nelson Tift {{received the}} contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 {{with the name of}} Atlanta, after the city in Georgia. This was largely financed by contributions from the women of Savannah. Fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull to support her casemate.

500|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Duncan had a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. In 1936, the 12-pounder was replaced by two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns. Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns were replaced by [...] Oerlikon AA guns.|$|E
500|$|The Type 34s carried five [...] SK C/34 guns {{in single}} mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried {{on top of}} the aft superstructure. The guns were {{numbered}} from one to five from front to rear. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of four [...] SK C/30 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six [...] C/30 guns in single mounts. The ships carried eight [...] torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Georg Thiele had four depth charge launchers mounted on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rear deckhouse, which was supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges {{on the sides of the}} stern, with either 32 or 64 charges carried. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) was fitted to detect submarines.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} from the Western Approaches Command on 30 May to support the evacuation from Dunkirk. She made two trips to Dover during the following day and evacuated a total of 695 men. Basilisk returned to La Panne to load more troops {{on the morning of}} 1 June and was attacked three times by German bombers. One bomb from the first wave detonated inside the No. 3 boiler room, killed all of her boiler and engine room personnel, fractured her steam lines and knocked out all her machinery. Near misses from the same attack buckled <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull and her upper deck. The ship's torpedoes and depth charges were jettisoned to reduce topweight and the French fishing trawler Jolie Mascotte attempted to tow Basilisk. A second attack caused no further damage, but caused the French ship to drop the tow. The third attack around noon sank Basilisk in shallow water at [...] Jolie Mascotte and the destroyer [...] rescued eight officers and 123 crewmen from the ship. Whitehall then destroyed the wreck with gunfire and torpedoes.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the move}} to Grand Rapids, Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager; experimenting with drugs, dating a much older boyfriend, and {{cultivating}} a punk appearance (dyeing her hair various colors, shaving <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe). She was put in therapy {{at the age of}} 14. Anderson listened to bands such as Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as [...] "class clown", [...] "most bizarre girl" [...] and [...] "most likely to be arrested". She was, in fact, arrested on graduation night for breaking and entering into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors. She later managed to reduce the charges to trespassing.|$|E

Detroit carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.|$|E

2500|$|Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub {{his nose}} (which is being irritated by his glasses), {{realizes that the}} woman who {{allegedly}} saw the murder had impressions in <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose, indicating that she wore glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, including Juror 4, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds {{that she would not}} have been wearing them while trying to sleep and points out that on her own evidence, the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10, and 4 change their vote to [...] "not guilty", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but then breaks down crying and changes his vote to [...] "not guilty", making the vote unanimous. The jurors then leave the room to reveal their verdict to the court.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached Fernhill and was within [...] of Gatwick's runway, it clipped {{the top of}} some oak trees {{in the garden of}} a house called Twinyards on Peeks Brook Lane. This was about [...] from the point of impact on the ground. It then left tyre marks {{on the roof of the}} neighbouring house and knocked chimney-pots off the house opposite, a further [...] on. At this point {{the aircraft}} was only [...] off the ground. It then caught a television aerial and another group of trees, damaging components on the right-side wing. As it started to roll, the aircraft's wheels touched down briefly and it started to rise again. It failed to clear Longfield, a detached house owned by William and Ann Jones which stood [...] further west, and completely destroyed it. One engine landed in the wreckage of the house along with the rear section of the fuselage, while the forward section of the aircraft disintegrated over a [...] trail. The fuel spilt and immediately caught fire, engulfing the fuselage and the wreckage of the house. The Joneses were killed, but their baby survived with minor injuries: <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cot collapsed inwards, [...] "forming a protective tent under one of the engines".|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, and left <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette {{that looks like a}} taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
