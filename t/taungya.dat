5000|$|Between the 1870s and the 1930s, the <b>taungya</b> system {{became less}} and less {{supported}} as a method for harvesting teak. In 1885, the British Empire won the Third Anglo-Burmese War and took control of Upper Burma. Control of this region gave the Empire access to an even larger supply of teak. However, <b>taungya</b> was not the most effective manner to exploit this newly acquired bounty. Most of Upper Burma was remote, and the British Forest Department {{did not have the}} resources to administer the <b>taungya</b> systems in the area. Instead the government selectively felled teak without the providing continuous employment for locals. <b>Taungya</b> also suffered in the Pugu Hills. As the British consolidated their control of Burma, they depended {{less and less}} on the cooperation of the Karen people to retain their power. Therefore, they were able offer less beneficial terms to <b>taungya</b> practitioners. Over time, this led to a decline in its use among Karen in the Pegu Hills.|$|E
50|$|While the Karen {{people of}} the Pegu Hills had {{initially}} been unwilling to adopt the <b>taungya</b> system, increased enclosure and agreements with British Colonial authorities meant that by the 1890s most Karen {{had no choice but}} to adapt. These same people came to feel left in the lurch when the British Government began to shift its focus to cheaper and less labor-intensive methods of teak extraction in Upper Burma. Karen who had bought into the <b>taungya</b> system felt sold out when they could no longer count on the government to pay them for their compliance. Those who had avoided adopting the system and continued shifting cultivation found that most was either under permanent cultivation or <b>taungya.</b> These feelings were heightened when <b>taungya</b> was phased out in 1935.|$|E
50|$|After all {{the crops}} have been harvested, every {{household}} kills a pig {{or two and}} cooks some pieces of pork in a bamboo tube. The household members then take the meat along with rice and khaung to their <b>taungya.</b> Once they arrived at their <b>taungya,</b> offerings are made to various nats roaming near the streams close to the <b>taungya.</b> They then pray to the nats for their physical well-being. After they return home, they threw a feast {{with the rest of}} the pork and khaung. This pwe is also celebrated on the same day by all the villagers.|$|E

50|$|The Mro, {{just like}} many other ethnic groups from the hilly regions of Southeast Asia, {{practice}} <b>taungya</b> cultivation. They cultivate on the hillsides after cutting down the trees, which usually takes them a month. This process usually occurs in January or February. Around March, they burned the trees that are taken down for <b>taungya</b> paddy cultivation and they start sowing at the wind of April. When they sow the seeds separately in pits, they would use spades, which are made with a long handle from an old taungya-cutting-dah (knife) {{that is no longer}} usable.|$|E
5000|$|While the <b>taungya</b> {{system of}} {{simultaneously}} growing teak {{and other crops}} was espoused by the British, shifting cultivation was and has remained the norm in Burma. Due to its precolonial roots and perceived inefficiencies, it is often characterized as backwards. However, some scholars find this assessment to be flawed given the political independence that it gave to its practitioners [...] While the <b>taungya</b> system did entail shifting cultivation, it ran counter to {{the goals of the}} Karen. The initial steps of logging and burning meant the destruction of the native forest. The forest, along with the hills, naturally isolated the Karen from the rest of Burma. <b>Taungya</b> also meant that the British or their agents would return to the previously cut areas after some years to harvest the newly planted teak. This increased traffic through their territory would also impact their secluded status. Given their suspicion of the lowland states they were isolated from, the British included, the Karen were reluctant to lose this protection.|$|E
50|$|Early {{efforts to}} {{introduce}} <b>taungya</b> to Burmese teak productions {{started in the}} Pegu Hills, between the Irrawaddy and Sittaung rivers in central Burma. The people that the British imagined would implement their <b>taungya</b> system of teak cultivation were ethnic Karens who had been residents of the region for generations without incorporation into the lowland Burman culture. Avoidance of the lowland has long been key to the identity and survival of the Karen people. Some, like the political scientist James C. Scott, argue that Karen civilization has been carefully organized {{with the goal of}} lessening the influence of the dominant empire of the time, be it Burmese or British This tendency often meant that Karens choose to live in upland areas where they would be out of immediate reach of such states. Given this heritage, many Karen living in the Pegu Hills were reluctant to integrate themselves into the <b>taungya</b> system that the British devised. In addition to opposing it for the political power it gave the British, they found the practice of a form of agriculture unpracticed by their fore-bearers culturally threatening.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of a new <b>taungya</b> cultivation, the villagers collectively buy two goats, and two fowls {{gathered}} from each household. One of the goat is put in front of the hut closest to the stream and the other near the second hut. The fowls are then placed in between the two huts. After the villagers pray for good health and the abundance of crops for the coming <b>taungya</b> cultivation, both the goats and fowls are slaughtered one after another starting from the goat nearest to the stream. The blood of the animals is then sprayed over the small huts and the flowing water. The villagers then cooked the goats and the fowls are reclaimed by their respective owners. With the meat and khaung, they made an offering to the nat before they begin the feast. Meanwhile, the village is shut down for three days and the villagers fix up bamboo arches over the village path. If anyone enters the village during this time period, a compensation has to be paid to cover all the expenses incurred. This ceremony is celebrated once a year and after the ceremony, they can start their <b>taungya</b> cultivation for the year.|$|E
50|$|In 1841 {{the first}} Superintendent of Forests for Tenasserim was appointed. This {{appointment}} represented {{a change from}} indiscriminate to considered teak exploitation in Burma. Other areas with major teak stocks, such as the Pegu (now Bago) Hills, were placed {{under the control of}} the British Government. However, even though, on paper, the British government owned the land the teak was situated on, it did not necessarily control it. Taking control of this land conveniently dovetailed with a particular method of teak cultivation. This method was shifting cultivation or <b>taungya.</b> <b>Taungya</b> is the practice of removing the teak from stretches of forest, burning the remainder, planting teak and other crops in their place and nurturing both together until the teak is mature enough to grow on its own, at which point another section of forest can be started on. This practice meant that the laborers who planted teak and tended crops would be strongly tied to the British colonial authorities, from whom they received salaries. In addition to creating a British presence in the lives of locals, <b>taungya</b> was quickly taken up due to being cheaper than the creation of teak plantations.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{directly}} {{on the heels of}} <b>taungya</b> came another form of teak exploitation. This system, which eventually {{came to be known as}} the Myanmar Selection System reduced the British Empire's dependency on the local Karen people. This method entails dividing an area of forest into thirty sections of roughly equal area, one of which is logged every thirty years. However, to put this system into place, the colonial government needed greater control of the forest than the <b>taungya</b> system entailed. To do so, in 1870, the British government created the first enclosure that prevented natives from cutting teak and other woods. Without locals interfering with teak and other woods, the government was free to enact new forestry policies. By 1879 it had reserved 1,410 square miles of forest.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Karen {{were more}} {{interested}} in maintaining their independence than uniting economically with the British, the implementation of <b>Taungya</b> required the use of force. The British government seized {{on the fact that the}} Karen had no legal title to the land that they occupied, and had occupied for generations. Teak tracts in the Pegu Hills were pronounced state property. The government also made it illegal to burn or damage teak trees within these forests. This law effectively criminalized traditional Karen agricultural practices. Due to the wide distribution of teak in the Pegu Hills, almost any location that a Karen farmer could choose to clear would contain some trees. The British government now found itself in a position to fine or prosecute most of the people living in the area. However, the new laws were difficult to enforce. Breakage was rampant and the British criminal justice system was underfunded and ineffectual. It took until 1869 for a concrete and successful push to implement <b>taungya</b> to be made. At this point, the colonial government, tired of Karen resistance, began to make deals with villages promising them plots of land for permanent cultivation in return for their labor in the <b>taungya</b> system. This arrangement was a major concession for Karen villagers as it entailed abandoning the shifting cultivation they had traditionally practiced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taungya</b> is {{a vastly}} used system {{originating}} in Burma. In {{the initial stages}} of an orchard or tree plantation, the trees are small and widely spaced. The free space between the newly planted trees can accommodate a seasonal crop. Instead of costly weeding, the underutilized area provides an additional output and income. More complex taungyas use the between-tree space for a series of crops. The crops become more shade resistant as the tree canopies grow and the amount of sunlight reaching the ground declines. If a plantation is thinned in the latter stages, this opens further the between-tree cropping opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|During {{that time}} Burma's teak forests were {{controlled}} by militant Karen tribals. He introduced the [...] "taungya" [...] system (King KFS (1968). [...] "Agro-silviculture (the <b>taungya</b> system)". University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry, Bulletin no. 1, 109pp.), in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. In return {{they were allowed}} to plant crops for the first few years between the trees. As the teak trees grew, villagers were moved to new land and the process was repeated. As a result of this process, many villagers became dependent on the state forestry service and local resistance to the state takeover of forests became increasingly difficult.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>taungya</b> {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} {{are ready for the}} harvest, household members go into their taungyas and collect several different vegetables and fruits with a few plants of paddy. The vegetables and fruits are then put into a big basket and paddy into khaung pot. A fowl is then killed and its blood sprinkled over the khaung pot and the vegetable basket. A fowl is then cooked using rice flour and mixing it with salt and ginger. Then the rice is mixed with the khaung and then together with the fowl, they made offering in various different baskets to the nats who live in the staircase of the house. Neighbors are then invited to enjoy the rest of the meat. This natpwe is held on the same day by different households in a village. Villagers can harvest their produce after the ceremony.|$|E

The {{research has shown that}} there are a number of constraints to the use of <b>taungya</b> in East Kalimantan for the rehabilitation of burnt, logged-over forest. The problems are a mix of technical, economic and social. It was found that the costs of establishing the <b>taungya</b> is comparable with that for establishment of industrial forest plantations but technical problems such as the lack of soil preparation, poor quality seed and inadequate fertiliser application techniques resulted in very low yields of the intercrops. This was exacerbated by protection problems and significant damage by birds and browsing animals further reduced yields. Some of these problems may be overcome by guarding the <b>taungya</b> fields and planting crops such as fibre producers which need less protection. However, unless the <b>taungya</b> system can be made economic and attractive to villagers it will be difficult to implement, especially in an area where there is no shortage of land close to the villages...|$|E

40|$|Massive scale {{plantation}} forestry in Myanmar {{began in}} the early 1980 s as a drastic measure to fulfil the increasing demand for timber and to prevent the conversion of deteriorated forestland to agricultural land. Myanmar Forest Department is recruiting shifting cultivators, establishing plantation villages and applying the <b>taungya</b> method in establishing teak plantations. From the very beginning, there was an argument about whether the project is creating forest protective groups or forest destructive groups. A key determinant to that question from the researcher point of view is the socio-economic situations; knowing the present situation of the plantation villagers can help to understand the forest management practices. Interview surveys were carried out in three villages in Bago Yoma, the main region of the special teak plantation program, to examine the current economic benefits to plantation villagers. Questions were designed mainly to explore the incentives for people participation and the socio-economic situations of the plantation villagers. Principal component analysis was used to analyze the collected data. It was found that local people are willing to participate in the initial establishment of plantations. However, all the incentives relating to the project are temporary, with no long-term consideration for <b>taungya</b> farmers, which jeopardizes the plan to create forest protective groups.

Stem canker was judged {{to be the most}} dangerous disease. Invasion of disease in uncut forest (control) was low level compared with cutting treatments, but difference of disease invasion between the forests with different cutting intensities was not clear because of low numbers of sample trees.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for wood, fibre and pulp coupled with efforts to mitigate {{greenhouse gas emission}} has put immense importance {{on the development of}} forest plantations. The rapidly growing human population will also face shortage of food, particularly in developing world where agricultural productivity is generally low. The <b>taungya</b> system – an age-old agroforestry practice involving intercropping of crops with trees on the same unit of land – is opined as a win-win strategy {{to meet the needs of}} wood products and food at the same time. In recent years, the <b>taungya</b> system has gained increasing attention by big forest companies as a tool and an opportunity to contribute to the social well-being of the local community. Stora Enso Lao Co, Ltd is one of these forest companies that adopted the <b>taungya</b> system in its commercial Eucalyptus plantations in Laos. The tree spacing commonly used is 9 × 1 m, and 5 × 2 m on a trial basis. Eucalyptus camaldulensis was intercropped with rice and cassava, and stands were established in 2007 (7 -yr old) and in 2012 (2 -yr old). The main objective of this thesis was to examine whether the intercropping has an effect on the root system of trees; thereby generating knowledge that supports evidence-based plantation management decisions involving <b>taungya</b> system. The key research questions were: (a) Does intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees compared with monoculture plantation of different spacing? (b) Does spacing (5 × 2 m versus 9 × 1 m) influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees intercropped with rice? (c) Does root biomass differ between young (2 -yr old) and mature (7 -yr old) intercropped stands with 9 × 1 m spacing compared with monoculture plantation? If so, does the effect vary in relation to distance from the tree and soil depth? To characterize the root system architecture, trenches were made on six young trees in both pure monoculture and intercropped stands. To quantitatively estimate root biomass, a total of 324 soil cores (6 stands × 6 trees × 3 distances × 3 soil depths) was collected, roots sorted and dried to constant mass in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours. The root dry mass data were subjected to analysis of variance to examine significant effects of intercropping, spacing and stand age. The results show that (1) the root system of E. camaldulensis is mainly confined to shallow depth but well elongated horizontally in both pure and intercropped stands with 4 - 6 thick lateral roots; (2) Intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus has no effect on total root dry mass of the tree component (p > 0. 05) irrespective of the plantation models (5 × 2 m or 9 × 1 m); however root biomass decreases with increasing horizontal distance from the tree base and in deeper soil layer; particularly for trees in young stands; (3) The effects of spacing design, narrow (5 × 2 m) versus wide (9 × 1 m), on root dry mass are dependent on horizontal and vertical distribution of the root system; and root biomass appears to be higher at 40 cm soil depth for the stand with narrow spacing between trees and crops than stands with wider spacing; (4) Root biomass was larger for older than younger trees in both monoculture and intercropped stands; suggesting lack of carry-over effect of intercropping on root biomass. As root biomass varies with horizontal distribution, further research is recommended to test buffer zones between trees and crops other than 1 m (which is currently used) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Forest {{plantation}} {{costs can}} be reduced by the income from annual crops that are intercropped with trees. An experiment was carried out over two years to assess the viability of agroforestry systems including sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and maize (cultivar AG 1051). In 2010, the legumes were grown both as monocrops and intercropped (<b>taungya</b> system) with maize in randomized blocks with five replications. Three rows of maize were planted between two rows of each legume (at a spacing of 4. 0 m x 4. 0 m). In 2011, the legumes were cut down, and the young branches and leaves {{were added to the}} areas of intercropped cultivation (alley cropping system). Gliricidia had lower plant height than sabiá. Moreover, while not affecting for gliricidia, intercropping increased plant height for sabiá. Intercropping reduced green ear yield but not grain yield and reduced the cost of introducing reforestation. Intercropping using the alley system reduced the total number and mass of green ears, as well as grain yield, but did not influence the yield of marketable green ears. Finally, producing green ears was more profitable than producing grain and maize monocropping provided a higher net income than intercropping...|$|E
40|$|The {{conflict}} whether certain {{districts of}} indigenous forest should {{be assigned to}} agriculture or forestry, had been more heated in Bantam than in all the outlying provinces of the Netherlands East Indies. At {{the beginning of this}} century an abortive attempt was made to eliminate shifting (ladang or hoema) cultivation. To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the hoema system with special reference to forest reservation, the author studied the hoema cultivation as an agricultural system, its consequences for local people and for other land use, crop yields, the traditional (adat) law and the legal hoema regulations in Bantam. Kools arrived at the conclusion that the aims in the hoema region should be: 1. Establishment of field crops between young forest tree seedlings (<b>Taungya</b> system) to provide immediate relief; 2. research into intensification of the hoema cultivation; 3. rigorous checks against illegal reclamation. Hoema cultivation must be considered as a primitive extensive agricultural system, which did not need to exhaust the soil, but usually did. It was recommended that shifting cultivation be restricted to particular forest blocks, also in the rest of Java and in Madoera. <p/...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{resource}} management literature has documented three paradigm shifts {{over the past}} decade: from co-management to adaptive co-management and adaptive governance respectively and, more recently, towards landscape governance. The latter is conceived as a governance approach towards negotiated land use at the landscape level to deal with global challenges such as food insecurity, climate change and biodiversity loss. There {{is not a lot}} of clarity about how co-management systems could actually evolve into landscape governance. This paper aims to address the gap by exploring how a stalled co-management system for the reforestation of degraded forest areas—the modified <b>taungya</b> system (MTS) in Ghana—could be revitalised and redesigned as a landscape approach. Drawing on case studies and expert consultation, the performance of the national MTS and the MTS under the Community Forestry Management Project is reviewed with regard to five principles (integrated approach, multi-stakeholder negotiation, polycentric governance, continual learning and adaptive capacity) and three enabling conditions (social capital, bridging organisations and long-term funding) distilled from the literature. The authors conclude that some of these principles and conditions were met under the Community Forestry Management Project, but that continual learning, transcending jurisdictional boundaries, developing adaptive capacity, and long-term funding and benefits still pose challenges...|$|E
40|$|Climate change, {{caused by}} global warming, is a {{phenomenon}} partly resulting from abundance of {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere. It is the most pressing environmental problem of the world today. It persists, and it cannot be stopped. Rather, it can be mitigated. Agroforestrysystems as land use can reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. This study therefore aimed to generate data on the carbonstocks of three selected agroforestry systems located within the Province of Bukidnon. The methodologies used include measurement of treesat diameter breast height (dbh) and sampling of herbaceous vegetation, litter, and soil for carbon content determination and farmer interview. Results showed that carbon accumulation of agroforestry systems goes along with the following order: <b>taungya</b> agroforestry system (174 MgCha - 1) > mixed multistorey system (162 MgC ha - 1) > falcata-coffee multistorey system (92 MgC ha - 1). Carbon was stored in the various pools inthe following order of magnitude: soil (77 - 92 %) > trees (7 - 22 %) > herbaceous vegetation and litter (1 %). Compared with natural forests, theseselected agroforestry systems represents 23 - 44 % of the total carbon stock. Policy programs promoting the establishment of agroforestry systemsin idle lands in Bukidnon should be considered...|$|E
