25|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, interest in vegetable oils as fuels for internal combustion engines was reported in several countries during the 1920s and 1930s and later during World War II. Belgium, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Japan and China were reported to have tested and used vegetable oils as diesel fuels during this time. Some operational problems were reported due to the high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which results in poor atomization of the fuel in the fuel spray and often leads to deposits and coking of the injectors, combustion chamber and valves. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> included heating of the vegetable oil, blending it with petroleum-derived diesel fuel or ethanol, pyrolysis and cracking of the oils.|$|E

25|$|On August 30, NCMC voted {{unanimously}} to approve the memorial foundation's preferred site on Washington Avenue SW. NCMC gave active consideration to six of the sites proposed by the foundation. District of Columbia officials strongly supported the preferred site in their testimony before the commission. D.C. officials expressed concern about two issues, however. The first {{was the number of}} pedestrians crossing 2nd Street SW to the east and Independence Avenue SW to the north to reach the memorial. The second was the weight of the planned memorial. The man-made below-ground structure supporting the existing parkland and streets was not designed to carry a heavy granite or bronze memorial, nor the weight of a fountain. They cautioned that the District of Columbia supported the preferred site only because they understood that the memorial would consist of a garden rather than sculpture or a monument. City officials, however, pledged to work with memorial designers <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> Brown testified that the DVLMF supported the site because it had a direct line of sight with the U.S. Capitol, and would remind members of Congress of their weighty responsibilities when considering issues of war and peace.|$|E
25|$|Before 1800, most cloth {{was made}} in home workshops, and housewives sewed it into {{clothing}} for family use or trade with neighbors. In 1810 {{the secretary of the}} treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including hosiery and linen, was produced by households. By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores. The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. Samuel Slater secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and build new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs. By the time the Embargo Act of 1807 cut off trade with Britain, there here were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used Arckwright water frames powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England. In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the putting-out system of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 Francis Cabot Lowell of the Boston Manufacturing Company built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of 1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Inside No. 9 production, the {{anthology}} series was a rare genre for British television programmes. Previous horror anthologies include Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents; while these would sometimes use comedic elements, they are more prominent in Inside No. 9. Murder Most Horrid followed a similar format, but was far more comedic than horrific. Other anthology-like series on British television include Seven of One and Comedy Playhouse, though these programmes lacked horror elements, and, unlike Inside No. 9, served as pilots for potential series. However, the British anthology show Black Mirror, which also features elements of comedy and horror, was very popular around {{the time of}} Inside No. 9. For Pemberton, the 1970s and 1980s were [...] "full of" [...] anthology shows; other examples included Play for Today, Beasts and Armchair Thriller. More recently, anthologies have become less popular with television executives, but the writers hope that {{they may be able to}} contribute to a [...] "renaissance" [...] for the genre. According to journalist and broadcaster Mark Lawson, this is because anthologies can fail to motivate viewers to stay with a series, and, further, new sets and casts must be paid for each episode, meaning that a six-part anthology series will generally be more expensive than a six-part series in a more standard format. For Lawson, Inside No. 9 was able <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> through the [...] "pleasing coherence" [...] offered by the fact each episode was set in a number 9, and [...] "the wit and inventiveness" [...] of the opening episodes, which could sufficiently engage viewers. Pemberton and Shearsmith had originally considered alternative ways to link the stories, such as all the settings having a shared post man, but then decided that such a strong relationship between stories was not needed.|$|E

2500|$|Modular {{construction}} {{techniques were}} incorporated during construction. Earlier submarines (e.g., Los Angeles-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull.

Modular construction was implemented in an effort <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a {{large segment of the}} pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a Virginia-class submarine.

The photographic plate in the Dodge technique was soon replaced with a film camera, but was still plagued by problems of accuracy, due to the difficulty of keeping all parts of the equipment perfectly aligned throughout a trial and accurately compensating for the distortion caused by the diffractive qualities of photographic lenses. In addition, it was usually necessary to restrain a participant's head by using an uncomfortable bite-bar or head-clamp.|$|E

2500|$|The Marquis de Sade viewed Gothic fiction as a {{genre that}} {{relied heavily on}} magic and phantasmagoria. In his {{literary}} criticism Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled [...] "Gothic" [...] by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel was a perfectly natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to [...] "look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels." [...] Sade held the work of writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' The Monk as without question the genre’s best achievement. Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was {{forced to choose between}} elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanation at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of The Monk, Sade believed that {{there was not a single}} Gothic novel that had been able <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> and that a Gothic novel that did [...] would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most image {{labeling}} {{problems such}} as segmentation and image reconstruction are fundamentally ill-posed and suffer from ambiguities and noise. Higher-order image priors encode high-level structural dependencies between pixels and are key <b>to</b> <b>overcoming</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> However, in general these priors lead to computationally intractable models. This paper addresses the problem of discovering compact representations of higher-order priors which allow efficient inference. We propose a framework for solving this problem that uses a recently proposed representation of higher-order functions which are encoded as lower envelopes of linear functions. Maximum a Posterior inference on our learned models reduces to minimizing a pairwise function of discrete variables. We show that our framework can learn a compact representation that approximates a low curvature shape prior and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving shape inpainting and image segmentation problems. ...|$|R
