To answer this question, we analyze unit value {{with respect to}} exporter country’s capacity to export, which is determined by its production cost, tariff, and distance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monopolistic competition model {{of trade and}} multinational production that incorporates asymmetric trade barriers and international differences in production costs. The model predicts the functional form for the dependence of U. S. exports and multinational production on <b>tariffs,</b> <b>distance,</b> and production costs. To deal with simultaneity, we estimate the nonlinear equations of U. S. exports and multinational production simultaneously. In the estimation, we also include country fixed effects and allow for endogenous location choice by firms. The estimation yields reasonable estimates of the structural parameters, including the elasticity of substitution. Based on the estimates, we then simulate the effects of trade liberalization. We find that the elimination of tariffs worldwide would increase U. S. exports by 3. 0 % and U. S. multinational production by 21. 7 %. This large expansion of U.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} link between export product variety and country {{productivity}} {{based on data from}} 34 industrial and developing countries, from 1982 to 1997. They measure export product variety by the share of U. S. imports on the set of goods exported by each sampled country relative to the world. It is a theoretically sound index which is consistent with within-country GDP maximization, as well as cross-country comparison. They construct country productivity based on relative endowments and product variety. Increases in output product variety improve country productivity as the new mix of output may better use resources of the economy, and improve allocation efficiency. Such effects depend on the elasticity of substitution in production between the different varieties. The more different the varieties are in terms of production, the more efficient it is to use the endowments of the economy when a new variety is available, which leads to productivity gains. In addition, as suggested in the literature, export product variety depends on trade costs, such as <b>tariffs,</b> <b>distance,</b> and transport costs. Such trade cost variables are used as instruments to help the authors identify the effects of export variety on country productivity. Empirical evidence supports their hypothesis. Overall, while export variety accounts for only 2 percent of cross-country productivity differences, it explains 13 percent of within-country productivity growth. A 10 percent increase in the export variety of all industries leads to a 1. 3 percent increase in country productivity, while a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs facing an exporting country leads to a 2 percent fall in country productivity.

With regards to the individual measures of logistics, the ease and affordability of shipping and timeliness had the greatest and least impact on bilateral exports respectively. Domestic logistics costs were however not significant in explaining bilateral trade flows. The evidence also shows asymmetries within country groups. Logistics at the destination was more important for primary commodity exports, at the origin more important for the export of oil/gas and manufactures and in developing countries more important for exports to high income countries.

Results show that difficulties faced by developing countries' exporters in accessing developed markets are 50 % higher than those faced by Northern exporters. These international fragmentation have however experienced a noticeable fall since 1980 in both Southern and Northern markets, and in all industries.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} traditionally exhibit passthrough {{of exchange}} rate changes that is greater and more rapid than high-income countries, but {{have experienced a}} rapid downward trend {{in recent years in}} the degree of short-run passthrough, and in the adjustment speed. As a consequence, slow and incomplete passthrough is no longer exclusively a luxury of industrial countries. Using a new data set [...] prices of eight narrowly defined brand commodities, observed in 76 countries [...] we find empirical support for some of the factors that have been hypothesized in the literature, but not for others. Significant determinants of the passthrough coefficient include per capita incomes, bilateral <b>distance,</b> <b>tariffs,</b> country size, wages, long-term inflation, and long-term exchange rate variability. Some of these factors changed during the 1990 s. Part (and only part) of the downward trend in passthrough to imported goods prices, and in turn to competitors' prices and the CPI, can be explained by changes in the monetary environment. Real wages also work to reduce passthrough to competitors' prices and the CPI, confirming the hypothesized role of distribution and retail costs in pricing to market. Rising distribution costs, due perhaps to the Balassa-Samuelson-Baumol effect, could contribute to the decline in the passthrough coefficient in some developing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Using the Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998) framework, a {{model of}} {{competition}} between vertically integrated telecommunications networks in a deregulated environment is developed. Two local operators compete in linear and non linear tariffs (i. e. two-part tariffs) in the subscribers market. In addition, they are integrated downstream in a potentially competitive sector (i. e. long distance sector) where they face competition of other firms which require (one way) access to local networks as an "essential facility". The purpose of the paper is to introduce a "downstream" competition in the usual framework of network competition and to focus on how the one way access charges are set in an oligopolistic market. In a mature phase of the industry, the presence of competition in both local and long distance sectors leads to lower local and long <b>distance</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The strategic role of the two-way and one-way access charges is pointed out, with particular reference {{to the effect that}} the reciprocal (two-way) access charge has on competition in the complementary sector.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} in International Economics has analysed the impact of increased import competition on domestic firms. The link between firm-level exports {{and changes in the}} competitive environment on foreign markets is less well understood, however. This is despite the fact that exports make up a significant and growing share of total manufacturing production in most countries. We derive a theory-based econometric specification linking destination-specific exports to foreign demand and the degree of competitiveness or "crowdedness" of a foreign market. The latter is a summary measure of the number and productive efficiency of firms competing in a given market and the barriers impeding their access, such as <b>tariffs</b> or physical <b>distance.</b> We estimate this specification on a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms in 1992 - 2003 and use the results for a series of counterfactual experiments. Our findings indicate that increased numbers and efficiency of foreign firms and improvements in their access to destination markets have reduced Italian exports by around 0. 2 - 0. 4 % per year. This is similar to the effects of tariff reductions for Italian firms (+ 0. 3 %/year) but smaller than the impact of higher unit labour costs (- 1. 4 %/year) and less favourable exchange rates (- 2. 0 %/year). By far the most important determinant of export performance was foreign demand growth, however, raising Italian exports by up to 5. 3 % per year or almost 60 % over the sample period. Our results also indicate that China's impact on Italian export performance is small and if anything positive.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 7, 2014 - June 7, 2016 The objective of this dissertation is to examine multi-product firms' productivity and export behavior. More specifically, this dissertation estimates productivity of firms that produce and sell multiple products, {{and the role of}} productivity in such firms' export behavior. In doing so, this dissertation develops a firm-level gravity approach to test whether multi-product firms self select to export or learn from exporting. In the first of part of this dissertation, I examine whether intra-firm resource reallocation of a multi-product firm affects its Total Factor Productivity (TFP). By extending earlier approaches, I estimate unbiased and consistent TFP of multi-product firms using a revenue-based production function. I find that TFP {{is more likely to be}} overestimated when multi-product firms' internalized demand linkage is not taken into account. I also find that multi-product firms' TFP decreases as it expands the number of products produced, but specialization of production does not play a role in TFP. In the second part, I present a theoretical framework to derive a firm-level gravity equation. By equating the total demand and total production of multi-product firms, I derive a firm-level gravity equation where export flows from firms to consumers is proportional to the product of economic size of firms, consuming power of a representative consumer, and trade resistance between origin and destination. Using the firm-level gravity equation, I test the hypothesis that high productivity firms self select to export and that the size of export flows is determined by productivity. I find that the economic size of exporting firms and the consuming power of a representative consumer have a positive and statistically significant effect on exports, while trade resistance such as <b>tariff</b> and <b>distance</b> have the opposite effect. I also find that the estimated coefficients of the firm-level gravity equation tend to be smaller than those of the traditional country-level gravity equation. In the final part of the dissertation, I test whether or not previous export experience improves the productivity of firms. Again, the estimable equation is derived from the equilibrium condition presented in the second part. My result confirms that previous export experience indeed improves productivity of exporting firms, but tariffs have the opposite effect. The results of this dissertation reveal the economic behavior of multi-product firms, which usually account for a large of economic activity and output in many countries. Understanding such firms' productivity and export behavior can offer strategies for economic growth and development. Empirical findings of this dissertation suggest policy options including lowering tariffs, and improving infrastructure that can lower transportation costs. Further examination of product range and specialization of production can offer strategies to source exports from small and midsize firms...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Trade {{liberalisation}} {{has been}} a prescription for all countries performing poorly and is seen to be necessary in all economies that have grown (Krueger, 1997). Cameroon initiated trade liberalisation in the late 1980 s; however, the implementation was not sustained because the government used tariffs to correct trade deficit and raise revenue. By the early 1990 s, the government was pressured by external factors, such as participation in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), {{the imposition of a}} Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), membership of the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA), the debt crisis, and internal factors, such as demands to promote competitiveness. The tariff rates were reduced along with other quantitative restrictions. The aim of this research is to measure the impact of trade liberalisation on the manufacturing sector. The main hypothesis is that trade liberalisation based on theory should {{have a positive impact on}} the manufacturing sector. To test this hypothesis, appropriate methodologies were used to empirically determine the hypothesis. Two periods were selected, 1980 to 1991 (pre–liberalisation period) and 1992 to 2006 (post–liberalisation period). The use of the period 1980 to 1991 allows for the capture of the status quo ante policy, while the period 1992 to 2006 allows for the capture of postliberalisation impacts (ex poste). The performance variables were regressed with trade policy variables and other control variables that can influence performance. The Ordinary Least Squares was used. The result of the study shows that reduction in protection rates (tariff) did not affect manufacturing positively, as measured by the export performance. The result from the estimation of the single equation supply model reveals that the relative price variable proxied for by the exchange rate and imported inputs is an important determinant of the performance of the manufacturing sector, as measured by export performance, though not significant statistically. The gravity model is used to complement the results from the estimation of the single equation supply model. The main manufacturing performance indicator is bilateral trade. Bilateral trade was regressed with trade and other control variables such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the two countries, <b>distance,</b> <b>tariffs,</b> membership of RTA, common language and border and colonial ties, which can all have an impact on the performance of the manufacturing sector. The results show that bilateral trade did not improve as a result of liberalisation. The results further reveal that the membership in RTA and the reduction in tariffs (all indications of liberalisation) did not positively influence bilateral trade in manufacturing. The distance variable and GDP variables equally did not influence bilateral trade in manufacturing. Overall, support for the hypothesis that trade liberalisation in the early 1990 s has had positive impacts on the manufacturing sector in Cameroon has not been obtained. The evidence indicates that liberalisation has negatively affected the manufacturing sector in Cameroon. The findings show that the long–term relationship between trade opening and industrialisation of the manufacturing sector is not stable and that trade opening negatively affects the manufacturing sector of Cameroon. This result is explained by the fact that importation of some inputs cannot be reduced. Moreover, Cameroon manufacturing enterprises are apparently unable to satisfy domestic demand and are uncompetitive. Given the evidence that, under Import Substitution Industrialisation policy, Cameroon established manufacturing firms not on the basis of revealed or latent comparative advantage, the seeming failure of ISI might be a consequence of these wrong decisions that were based on political needs rather than sound economics (Bhagwati, 1978). It is recommended that Cameroon should develop an industrial policy, which should be based on the identification of the revealed and latent comparative advantage in addition to the progressive and systemic acquisition of acquired comparative advantage as prescribe in the new trade theories. Government’s role should be an enabling one relying on market determination of resource allocation, and intervention should only take place when there is market failure. Clustering and agglomeration should be encouraged using the suggested tools, which should avoid rent seeking at all cost. Rigorous research at the microeconomic level is needed to identify the comparative advantage of Cameroon. Despite the findings of the research, intuitive reasoning and analysis of the various policies and actions indicate that trade liberalisation and market–economic decision–making, through government’s support (Lin & Monga, 2010) of the private sector (in a public–private partnership), through an overarching vision, is the way to go. The results from this research contribute towards policy–making that is grounded on sound and rigorous research and not rhetorical or political exigencies, which will ensure and guarantee a sound industrial policy reaffirming the importance of trade liberalisation despite the criticism and an industrial policy based on revealed and latent comparative advantages, which will lead to competitiveness with scientifically justified potentials for the manufacturing sector (GESP, 2010 : 35).

Diese Dissertation befasst sich mit der fairen Verteilung der gemeinsamen Kosten einer Gruppe auf ihre Mitglieder. Die Arbeit verbindet kooperative Spieltheorie und {{state-of-the-art}} Algorithmen aus der linearen und ganzzahligen Optimierung, um faire Allokationen zu definieren und sie numerisch für große reale Anwendungen zu berechnen. Unsere Ansätze übertreffen traditionelle Kostenverteilungsmethoden im Sinne der Fairness und der Nutzerzufriedenheit. Kooperative Spieltheorie analysiert die möglichen Gruppierungen von Einzelnen, um Koalitionen zu bilden. Es bietet mathematische Werkzeuge um faire Preise in dem Sinne zu bestimmen, dass der Zusammenbruch der großen Koalition verhindert und die Stabilität erhöht wird. Bei der aktuellen Definition des Kostenallokationsspiels werden weder mögliche Koalitionen von Spielern beschränkt noch Bedingungen an die Preise gestellt, wie es häufig in der realen Anwendungen erforderlich ist. Unsere Verallgemeinerung bringt das Kostenallokationsspiel-Modell einen Schritt näher an die Praxis. Basierend auf unserer Definition, präsentieren und diskutieren wir in dieser Arbeit verschiedene mathematische Konzepte, die Fairness modellieren. Diese These behandelt auch die Frage, ob eine "beste Kostenallokation" existiert, die Menschen präferieren. Es ist bekannt, dass multikriterielle Optimierungsprobleme oftmals keine optimale Lösung besitzen, die gleichzeitig jede Zielfunktion optimiert. Es gibt kein "perfektes" Wahlverfahren, welches die fünf grundlegenden "social choice procedures" aus dem Buch "Mathematics and Politics. Strategy, Voting, Power and Proof" von Taylor et al. erfüllt. Gleiches gilt für das Kostenallokationsproblem. Es gibt keine Kostenallokation, die jede unserer gewünschten Eigenschaften erfüllt. Unsere Spiel-theoretischen Konzepte versuchen den Grad der axiomatischen Verletzung zu minimieren und erhalten gleichzeitig die Gültigkeit einiger wichtiger Eigenschaften. Aus Sicht der Komplexität ist es NP-schwer, die Allokationen, die auf den Spiel-theoretischen Konzepten basieren, zu berechnen. Die größte Herausforderung ist, dass es exponentiell viele mögliche Koalitionen gibt. Allerdings kann diese Schwierigkeit überwunden werden, indem man "constraint generation"-Ansätze benutzt. Einige primale und duale Heuristiken werden vorgestellt, um die Laufzeit des Separierungsproblems zu verringern. Basierend auf diesen Techniken können wir unsere Anwendungen lösen, deren Größen von klein mit 4 Spielern, bis mittel mit 18 Spielern, und groß mit 85 Spielern und 2 ^{ 85 }- 1 möglichen Koalitionen variieren. Durch Rechenergebnisse zeigen wir die Ungerechtigkeit der traditionellen Allokationen. Betrachten wir beispielsweise das Ticketpreis-Problem des niederländischen IC Schienennetzes. Der aktuelle Entfernungstarif resultiert in einer Situation, bei der die Passagiere in der zentralen Region des Landes über 25 % mehr zahlen im Vergleich zu den ihnen entstehenden Kosten und dieser Überschuss subventioniert einige andere Bahn-Verbindungen, das ist absolut nicht fair. Im Gegensatz dazu senken unsere Spiel-theoretischen Preise diese Ungerechtigkeit und erhöhen den Anreiz für Spieler in der großen Koalition zu bleiben. Due to economy of scale, {{it is suggested}} that individual users, in order to save costs, should join a cooperation rather than acting on their own. However, a challenge for individuals when cooperating with others is that every member of the cooperation has to agree on how to allocate the common costs among members, otherwise the cooperation cannot be realised. Taken this issue into account, we set the objective of our thesis in investigating the issue of fair allocations of common costs among users in a cooperation. This thesis combines cooperative game theory and state-of-the-art algorithms from linear and integer programming in order to define fair cost allocations and calculate them numerically for large real-world applications. Our approaches outclasse traditional cost allocation methods in terms of fairness and users' satisfaction. Cooperative game theory analyzes the possible grouping of individuals to form their coalitions. It provides mathematical tools to understand fair prices in the sense that a fair price prevents the collapse of the grand coalition and increases the stability of the cooperation. The current definition of cost allocation game does not allow us to restrict the set of possible coalitions of players and to set conditions on the output prices, which often occur in real-world applications. Our generalization bring the cost allocation game model a step closer to practice. Based on our definition, we present and discuss in the thesis several mathematical concepts, which model fairness. This thesis also considers the question of whether there exists a "best" cost allocation, which people naturally like to have. It is well-known that multicriteria optimization problems often do not have "the optimal solution" that simultaneously optimizes each objective to its optimal value. There is also no "perfect" voting-system which can satisfy all the five simple, essential social choice procedures presented in the book "Mathematics and Politics. Strategy, Voting, Power and Proof" of Taylor et al. Similarly, the cost allocation problem is shown to experience the same problem. In particular, there is no cost allocation which can satisfy all of our desired properties, which are coherent and seem to be reasonable or even indispensable. Our game theoretical concepts try to minimize the degree of axiomatic violation while the validity of some most important properties is kept. From the complexity point of view, it is NP-hard to calculate the allocations which are based on the considered game theoretical concepts. The hardest challenge is that we must take into account the exponential number of the possible coalitions. However, this difficulty can be overcome by using constraint generation approaches. Several primal and dual heuristics are constructed in order to decrease the solving time of the separation problem. Based on these techniques, we are able to solve our applications, whose sizes vary from small with 4 players, to medium with 18 players, and even large with 85 players and 2 ^{ 85 }- 1 possible coalitions. Via computational results, we show the unfairness of traditional cost allocations. For example, for the ticket pricing problem of the Dutch IC railway network, the current <b>distance</b> <b>tariff</b> results in a situation where the passengers in the central region of the country pay over 25 % more than the costs they incur and these excess payments subsidize operations elsewhere, which is absolutely not fair. In contrast, our game theory based prices decrease this unfairness and increase the incentive to stay in the grand coalition for players...|$|R
