5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Division {{entered the}} line on 23 July 1916, {{taking part in the}} assault on Pozières. Initially they succeeded in {{carrying}} the German positions with relatively small losses, however, once the Germans had recovered they directed an intense artillery barrage upon the town which resulted in heavy losses. By the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July, they had suffered 5,286 casualties. Two days after taking over the line, the 2nd Division was thrown into a hastily planned attack that resulted in further casualties when the Germans spotted the Australians forming up and once again subjected them to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> artillery and machine guns. Another attack was launched on 4 August which, although it met with success, resulted again in such heavy casualties—almost 7,000—that the division was relieved the next day.|$|E

5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 19 April, the British mounted an assault in force upon Castillo San Felipe de Barajas. Three columns of grenadiers, {{supported}} by Jamaicans and several British companies, moved under cover of darkness, {{with the aid of}} an intense naval bombardment. The British fought their way {{to the base of the}} fort's ramparts where they discovered that the Spanish had dug deep trenches. This effectively rendered the British scaling equipment too short for the task. The British advance was stymied since the fort's walls had not been breached, and the ramparts could not be topped. Neither could the British easily withdraw in the face of intense Spanish fire and under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own equipment.

500|$|Many {{examples}} of species showing transitional features have been discovered. Ichthyostega {{was one of}} the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, Eusthenopteron. Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to support <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies on land. They developed [...] "hands" [...] and [...] "feet" [...] with five or more digits; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation. The fish's hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land. An affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra-occipital bones at the back of the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pozières the Australians were called upon to attack Mouquet Farm in August. All three {{divisions}} of I Anzac Corps were committed {{in an effort to}} force a breach in the German lines behind Thiepval, to the north of Pozières. The task of the initial advance fell to the 4th Division on 10 August, which had already suffered 1,000 casualties resisting the final German counter-attack, but in the ensuing battle it would lose a further three times that number as the Australians once again suffered {{at the hands of the}} German artillery, finding themselves squeezed into a frontage of less than [...] against which the Germans were able to concentrate <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> defence. Three more attacks were made over the course of the next three weeks as the Australians fought their way across the shell-pocked countryside to the farm, only to be forced out again shortly after by the concentration of German artillery. The other two divisions of I Anzac fared only slightly better in these attacks and at the end of the engagement, Australian casualties at Mouquet Farm totalled 6,300 men.|$|E

500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E
500|$|While {{the brigade}} {{was searching for}} water, the advance was running into problems. On 4 November the brigade was ordered to relieve the 5th Mounted Brigade at Ras El Nagb, [...] {{north-east}} of Beersheba. At 17:30 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles arrived, followed by the 6th Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rilfes, who lined up {{to the left of}} the Canterbury regiment, facing towards Kheuwelfeh. Their opposition was estimated to be around two thousand men and three artillery batteries. At 03:00 on 3 November the Turks began their attack; five hours later the 9th Squadron relieved the 6th Squadron in the front line. Only two hours later the 6th had to move back into the line, to the west of Ras El Nagb, where they stopped a Turkish attack trying to outflank the position. At 13:30 the 2nd Squadron came under a heavy artillery bombardment and suffered several casualties. After this the Turks carried out a bayonet charge, getting to within [...] of the regiment's lines before, under heavy fire, they were forced to withdraw. The regiment managed to hold their position, by <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fire power, until nightfall. The next morning the regiment was relieved by the ICCB. The battle had cost them nine men wounded. Gaza was captured on 7 November, but the regiment remained around Ras El Nagb until the night of 9 November.|$|E
500|$|Of the 58 {{original}} entrants to the event, ten {{pulled out}} before the entry list was published, generally because they either could not reduce <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> car sufficiently to be within the limits, or they could not achieve the required fuel efficiency. The first of the cars to arrive on the Isle of Man was the 16 horsepower Minerva, entered by Charles Rolls, but driven by E. H. Arnott, which arrived {{more than two weeks}} before the race. During the weeks before the race the cars were tested around the island's roads, during which Arnott managed the fastest circuit of the course. There were also a number of accidents during the practices; Ernest de Wilton crashed his Swift into a stone wall near Castletown, causing significant damage to the car. Although it was repaired in time there was a miscommunication between de Wilton and the race organisers, and de Wilton did not present the car for inspection in time to be entered into the race. Another of the competitors, A. McCormack in a Gladiator, hit some cows after coming off the road, and caused such damage to the car's brakes that it could not be repaired in time for the race. On the Sunday prior to the race local residents were upset that forty of the cars were driving the course, and meetings were held where they expressed their indignation that it was a [...] "desecration of the sanctity of the Sabbath". Three days prior to the race, the organisers began weighing the cars and filling them with the specified amount of fuel. The Mors car which was to have been driven by Dorothy Levitt never arrived on the island, and so Levitt was unable {{to take part in the}} race.|$|E

500|$|The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was allotted, as {{its primary}} task, the {{demolition}} of two bridges: one at Varaville and another at Robehomme. Much {{like the rest of}} the units in the division, the battalion was scattered throughout the operational area. One group of paratroopers landed [...] away from their drop-zone, and another landed only a short distance from the invasion beaches. A number were dropped in flooded areas around Varaville, and several drowned when they were dragged under the surface of the water due to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> equipment. A group of paratroopers moved towards the Robehomme bridge, encountering and gathering together several other groups of airborne troops and sappers en route, before reaching the bridge where they discovered it was still intact. By 03:00, the sappers tasked with {{the demolition of}} the bridge had failed to arrive, and so the paratroopers gathered together the small amount of explosives they possessed and set them off, weakening the bridge. The sappers finally arrived at 06:00, and completed the demolition of the bridge whilst the paratroopers protected them. Meanwhile, another company of the battalion had been attempting to complete the tasks it had been ordered to fulfill; it was to clear the enemy garrison from Varaville and destroy a gun emplacement, demolish a bridge over the River Divette, and also destroy a radio transmitter near Varaville. However, the company was severely understrength, with only a fraction of its 100 men available. A small group, led by the company commander, assaulted the fortifications outside Varaville that were manned by approximately ninety-six Germans supported by several machine-gun nests and an artillery piece. The artillery piece inflicted a number of casualties on the small Canadian force, killing the company commander, and a stalemate ensued until 10:00 when the enemy garrison surrendered after being subjected to mortar bombardment. The paratroopers were then relieved by British Commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade.|$|E
