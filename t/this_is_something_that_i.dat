5000|$|Sharing {{his view}} as to the reasons for his arrest, he {{explained}} that:In the past three months, a far-reaching defamation campaign was launched against me {{in a number of}} Israeli newspapers accusing me of supporting terrorism and violence and condoning suicide attacks.

The Israeli authority has launched a campaign aiming at silencing all those nationalistic voices in Jerusalem and claiming that these voices support terrorism, violence, etc. I believe that the only concerned party is the Israeli authority.

"I see The Suffering as {{somewhat}} unique among console action-adventure or shooter {{games in the}} seriousness of its subject matter and the moral themes it endeavors to explore. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted from day one and I am fairly happy with the result we achieved. To accomplish this, we {{made a number of}} key design decisions, from the player's ability to effect the world in a believable way (killing friendly humans), to the storytelling techniques we used, to the morality system that leads to the distinct endings. In the end though, the compatibility of a game about human atrocities over the ages within the [...] "gory shooter" [...] game milieu was perhaps our biggest limitation. As games seek to engage the player with more and more serious subject matter, the game mechanics need to evolve along with them, giving the player a wider expressive range than deciding whether to kill or not to kill.
