5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the point where <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel or flip the bike and rider over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
50|$|In early 1955 <b>the</b> Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> joined <b>the</b> Independence <b>Front</b> (a {{coalition}} of opponents to az-Zahari, including the Umma Party). Through {{the participation of}} <b>the</b> Anti-Imperialist <b>Front,</b> <b>the</b> Independence <b>Front</b> gained more influence in urban areas as workers' and students' movements became active in <b>the</b> Independence <b>Front.</b> <b>The</b> Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> broke away from <b>the</b> Independence <b>Front</b> in September 1955.

5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> end to lower.

5|$|The cusp at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{margin of the}} tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward <b>the</b> <b>front</b> (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there {{is a pair of}} cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar.

5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and reach to a point below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of m1.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends back to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part of the palate, extend back to a point between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear wheels. For a given displacement of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
