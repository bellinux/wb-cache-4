The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wish to forget".

500|$|Director Kim Manners, {{realizing the}} monotony {{of some of the}} scenes, such as Mulder waking up after each {{successive}} explosion, attempted to make each camera angle interesting.

[...] Clooney acknowledged that Kaufman's original script contained [...] "really funky scenes that would never reach the green light of being a studio film." [...] A drug addiction subplot was removed based on Barris's request for historical authenticity.|$|E

The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him.

500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately."

Interestingly one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
