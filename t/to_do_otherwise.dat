The season's show runners Tina Fey and Robert Carlock publicly committed to honor the strike themselves and to not ask their writers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise.</b> As a result, only 15 episodes of the 22 episodes ordered could be produced.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise</b> would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E

25|$|Omertà is a code {{of silence}} and secrecy that forbids mafiosi from betraying their comrades to the authorities. The penalty for {{transgression}} is death, and relatives of the turncoat may also be murdered. Mafiosi generally do not associate with police (aside perhaps from corrupting individual officers as necessary). For instance, a mafioso will not call the police when he {{is a victim of}} a crime. He is expected {{to take care of the}} problem himself. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise</b> would undermine his reputation as a capable protector of others (see below), and his enemies may see him as weak and vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Most nudists and naturist clubs {{consider}} it essential {{for reasons of}} hygiene {{to sit on a}} towel whenever sitting on a chair, bench, or any other place where others might sit (unless under water) and they {{consider it}} poor etiquette <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Some clubs encourage members or guests to bring their own chairs. Likewise, sitting on someone else's towel is considered a breach of etiquette. Similar rules may also apply to clothing-optional bike rides. Often in situations involving shared use of pools or tubs people are asked to shower first to minimize contamination and prolong the amount of time the water can be used before further maintenance is needed. This practice is also common in non-nudist pools.|$|E
25|$|When General Robert E. Lee {{discovered}} that his route to Danville was blocked at Jetersville, {{he knew his}} army had to make another night march to Farmville. Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and Major General Philip Sheridan were convinced that Lee's army would not remain at Amelia Court House another night, but Army of the Potomac commander Major General George Meade thought that they would. Meade ordered the II Corps, V Corps and VI Corps to move toward Amelia Court House at 6:00a.m. and Grant did not order him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise,</b> only to move swiftly. Sheridan did not move with the infantry but sent his cavalry to follow a road parallel and {{to the south of}} Lee's line of march to try to intercept the Confederates.|$|E

25|$|The French {{military}} {{became interested}} in the Christophe and Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863 and the French Army's Artillery Committee undertook an investigation into the possible adoption of the Belgian weapon. However it was decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise</b> and to create a proprietary mitrailleuse weapon by sole French industrial means. In May 1864, General Edmond Le Bœuf submitted a preliminary report entitled Note sur le Canon à balles to the Emperor Napoleon III. Full-scale manufacture began in September 1865, in great secrecy, under the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Verchère de Reffye (1821–1880). Assembly and some manufacturing took place at the workshops in Meudon but many parts came from the private industrial sector. Production was slow due to limited funding (the army had already spent much of its five-year budget on the Mle 1866 Chassepot rifle), forcing Napoleon III to pay for development and manufacture out of secret funds. The new weapon was thoroughly tested in 1868 at the military firing range at Satory, near Versailles, in conditions of great secrecy. Due to a fear of spies, test guns were concealed in tents while being fired at distant targets. The mitrailleuse performed mechanically with remarkable efficiency and much was expected of it in a combat situation.|$|E

The deputy clerks released statements pledging to continue issuing licenses after Davis' release and to ignore any order from her <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise,</b> complying with the federal judge's order. Licenses issued since Davis' refusal state that they are authorized by [...] "the office of the Rowan County Clerk" [...] but no longer bear her name. Davis' supporters, gathered at the Rowan County Courthouse since her first day in custody, said that her deputies were unlawfully issuing licenses and should resign or be fired.|$|E

500|$|It was, however, {{difficult}} for the Air Force <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from {{the western side of}} the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. [...] The depth of penetration by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the same man who had the last word in the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly [...] "neutral" [...] Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attaché within Project 404, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress was {{convened in}} {{response}} to the passage of the Intolerable Acts. Adams agreed to attend, despite an emotional plea from his friend Jonathan Sewall <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise.</b> At the Congress, Adams renewed his push for the right to a jury trial, stating [...] "Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty. Without them, we have no other fortification against being ridden like horses, fleeced like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed like swines and hounds.” Adams did not generally like the other delegates to the Congress. He complained of what he considered to be their pretentiousness, writing to Abigail, [...] "I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative." [...] The Congress disbanded in October after sending a letter of grievances to King George III.|$|E

Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise</b> would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E

500|$|After the {{granting}} of the charter, it took 50years before {{the first set of}} statutes to govern the school were completed. The Bishop of Winchester approved the statutes on 16 September 1608, and they constituted a major change in the way the school was run. Until this point the boys were instructed in English and accounting, but following the statutes lessons were in the subjects of Latin and Greek; with students required to speak in Latin unless licensed by the master <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Admissions following the charter also changed, with [...] "none to be admitted scholar into the said school before he be brought to the schoolmaster of that school, and upon his examination shall be found to have learned the rudiments of grammar, called the Accidence." [...] All scholars from the town of Guildford were required to pay the master 5shillings on admission to the school, and for those from outside the town the charge was 10s. The number of pupils at the school was capped at 100, although this number was rarely reached. The statues also saw the introduction of school fees. Although defined as a [...] "free" [...] school, fees were still charged at the rate of 4s. per annum, paid as 9d. per quarter for the provision of [...] "rods and brooms", with an additional shilling due on the feast of St. Michael, which was used to pay for [...] "clean, wax candles".|$|E
500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>otherwise</b> would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E
