25|$|At Loudon, Johnson {{finished}} 6th after {{blowing a}} tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes {{came to an}} end when his car broke a drive line, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>This</b> marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.|$|E
25|$|David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should be the way <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>This</b> would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E
25|$|Messene, {{then known}} as Zankle, {{was one of the}} Greek cities which had {{treaties}} with Carthage in 480 BC. Carthage and Syracuse had both pledged to honor the independence of Messene and Sicels in the treaty of 405. As Dionysius had broken the treaty in 404 and furthermore Messene had joined Syracuse, Carthage was no longer bound by the treaty. The previous campaign led by Himilco in 406 had progressed eastward along the southern coast of Sicily toward Syracuse. Moreover, the cities subdued by Carthage in that expedition, Akragas, Gela and Camarina lay along this route, the capture of which would yield much booty and subtract allies from Syracuse. Himilco chose not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>this</b> way, perhaps preferring to attack Syracuse directly.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the series}} aired its second episode, the writers spent time researching in offices. This process {{was used for}} Daniels' other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation. The pilot is a direct {{adaptation}} of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>this</b> route because [...] "completely starting from scratch {{would be a very}} risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. He had briefly considered using the idea for [...] "The Dundies" [...] as the pilot episode. After the writers knew who the cast was, they were allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, [...] "Diversity Day". Following the mixed reaction towards the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more [...] "optimistic" [...] and to make Michael Scott more likable. They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them actual personalities. They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British version.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} at the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The performance began with a video interlude of Spears talking to her dancers. She then appeared onstage, wearing a patched denim skirt. The set was made of giant coloring book drawings of houses and cars. After the second chorus, she invited the audience to sing along with her. At {{the end of the}} song, she briefly talked to the audience before taking off the skirt and top to perform [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". Shaheem Reid of MTV noted that during the opening night of the tour in Columbus, Ohio, [...] "Britney must've forgotten that the disco-era throwback cut was brand spanking new, because she kept encouraging everyone to sing along to the chorus [...] Although the crowd clapped and bobbed to the beat, Britney had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>this</b> one alone vocally". The music video, directed by Marty Callner, consisted of footage of the tour performance from Live from Las Vegas. Several effects were added, including a glittering ball {{and the name of the}} song appearing on the screen. The song was also promoted in a commercial Spears filmed for Toyota Vios.|$|E
500|$|Lafayette {{learned that}} the Continental Congress lacked funds for his voyage; hence, he {{acquired}} the sailing ship Victoire with his own money, for 112,000 pounds. He journeyed to Bordeaux, where Victoire was being prepared for her trip, and sent word asking for information on his family's reaction. [...] The response, including letters from his wife and other relatives, threw Lafayette into emotional turmoil. Soon after departure, he ordered the ship turned around and returned to Bordeaux, to the frustration of the officers traveling with him. The army commander there ordered Lafayette to report to his father-in-law's regiment in Marseilles. De Broglie, who hoped to become a military and political leader in America, met with Lafayette in Bordeaux and convinced him that the government actually wanted him <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>This</b> was not true, though there was considerable public support for Lafayette in Paris, where the American cause was popular. Lafayette wanted to believe it, and pretended {{to comply with the}} order to report to Marseilles, going only a few miles east before turning around and returning to his ship. Victoire set sail for the United States on 20 April 1777.|$|E

500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant <b>to</b> <b>go...</b> <b>This</b> pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

Voigt and Vrečer had to momentarily stop for a closed level crossing just inside of the final , as their lead was cut to around thirty seconds.
