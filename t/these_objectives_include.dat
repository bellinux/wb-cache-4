National Forest Inventories (NFI) provide one of the best large-scale sources of information, and therefore are a cornerstone of forest policies. The scopes of NFIs, which are the primary source of data for national and large-area assessments, has been broadened to include new variables to meet increasing information requirements.

Two objectives are proposed in the optimization processes when such schedules are created. <b>These</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>include</b> minimizing the time for completing jobs and minimizing any extra energy expended by laborers due to inappropriate work assignments that force them to work longer than the maximum acceptable work duration. A GA-based mechanism was developed to search the Pareto front, which is one of the effective ways for solving multiobjective optimization problems. Such a mechanism was implemented by computer programming using a numerical software tool called MATLAB. Theoretical examples demonstrated that the proposed model efficiently created work-rest schedules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The significance of these objectives is illustrated through reference to client organiza-tional change projects.

An important learning feature was students' consideration of the most effective displays for showing the variation in the data sets, with the emerging understanding that there is very likely to be measurement error in the first scenario and, hence, the measurement in the second scenario is an approximation.|$|R
