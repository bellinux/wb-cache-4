5|$|Huskisson saw the Duke of Wellington {{sitting in}} the front corner of his special carriage. Huskisson walked along the tracks to <b>the</b> <b>carriage,</b> {{extended}} a hand, and the Duke reached out of <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> and shook it.|$|E
5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carriages,</b> engine, and station {{buildings}} were severely damaged. <b>The</b> first <b>carriage</b> was crushed between {{the engine and}} <b>the</b> second <b>carriage.</b> <b>The</b> fourth <b>carriage</b> was knocked into the air causing it to drag along the station roof, damaging both the roof and the platforms to either side. Seventeen people, including the train crew, were killed and 25 injured.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crash was}} blamed on human error and a {{manoeuvre}} that went wrong. [...] It {{appears that the}} crew were intending {{to go back and}} pick up <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b> <b>The</b> worst casualties were in <b>the</b> first two <b>carriages.</b> Hence it appears that <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> crashed into part of the same train, not a following train.|$|R
50|$|After {{withdrawal}} of the service, in 2002 London and Continental Railways were credited by the UK Government with the lease fees on <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b> <b>The</b> UK Government reached an agreement with builders Alstom to sell <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> back, subject to Alstom securing a new purchaser.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carriages</b> {{featured}} wooden {{bodies on}} steel underframes with 43 fitted out as EBB first class carriages and 57 as EBA second class. <b>The</b> <b>carriages</b> gained <b>the</b> Bradfield <b>carriages</b> nickname after <b>the</b> New South Wales Railway's Chief Engineer John Bradfield, {{even though they}} were designed by Chief Mechanical Engineer Edward Lucy.|$|R
5000|$|The derailed {{engine and}} first two <b>carriages</b> passed <b>the</b> bridge. <b>The</b> first <b>carriage</b> broke free from <b>the</b> other <b>carriages.</b> Carriage one was torn open when it {{collided}} with a severed mast beside the track, killing eight passengers. <b>The</b> remaining <b>carriages</b> {{ground to a halt}} with <b>the</b> second <b>carriage</b> clear of <b>the</b> bridge. The rear half of <b>the</b> third <b>carriage,</b> and forward half of <b>the</b> fourth <b>carriage,</b> came to rest under the weakened bridge, whose weight was estimated at 570 t. Within seconds, with all its supports demolished, the bridge and several motor cars on top of it crashed onto <b>the</b> <b>carriages,</b> crushing them and the passengers inside.|$|R
50|$|Don Remington {{himself was}} a coach-builder, {{carriage}} restorer and coach, carriage and sleigh historian and it is with first-hand knowledge that he restored <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> in his collection.

5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> through its windows at any time. But public entry to <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). <b>The</b> <b>carriage</b> was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b> Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107), the Chamberlain Wu Deren {{presented}} specifications of the south-pointing carriage and <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air {{states that}} {{provided}} that pressure in diving cylinders {{is less than}} , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies {{have the right to}} refuse <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> of certain items.|$|E
50|$|In 1950-51 <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> had berths removed, {{making them}} empty shells. <b>The</b> <b>carriages</b> were {{therefore}} <b>the</b> best-suited for rebuilding into the Jubilee Train, celebrating 50 years since Federation. <b>The</b> <b>carriages</b> were repainted externally into green with gold and paired with locomotive N 430, painted {{in a similar}} livery. Locomotive N 432 at the ARHS Museum has been repainted into this Jubilee livery for many years, even though that engine never wore the green and gold scheme in service.|$|R
5000|$|The Talgo Pendular (Talgo IV and Talgo V, also VI & Talgo 200 or 6th generation), {{introduced}} in 1980, created the [...] "natural tilting" [...] train, using a passive system that tilts <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> with {{no need for}} electronic sensors or hydraulic equipment. The wheels are mounted on monoaxles between <b>the</b> <b>carriages,</b> and {{sitting on top of}} the monoaxles are suspension columns. <b>The</b> <b>carriages</b> are attached {{to the top of the}} suspension columns and swing outwards as the train goes through a curve.|$|R
50|$|The {{incident}} occurred around 11:15 a.m. S Chowdhary, site manager, {{who was arrested}} later, said the cable {{slipped out of the}} rails at the fourth tower from the upper station causing <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> to be knocked off. Of <b>the</b> three <b>carriages</b> that dropped to the ground, one was empty. There were nearly 50 passengers in <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b> <b>The</b> ropeway was switched off only after <b>the</b> third <b>carriage</b> fell. For nearly three hours <b>the</b> other <b>carriages</b> remained suspended. Sanjay Chander, Superintendent of Police, Darjeeling, said the accident took place due to negligence. Although Army help was sought for bringing down the cars, ropeway authorities were able to do it themselves. The West Bengal Government ordered an inquiry into the accident.|$|R
5|$|Office of Strategic Influence is {{the first}} album by American {{progressive}} rock band OSI, released by InsideOut Music on February 18, 2003. The album was recorded in June 2002 and mixed in August 2002 at <b>the</b> <b>Carriage</b> House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carriage</b> {{was nearly}} {{identical}} to <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
5|$|The gun was {{manufactured}} by Watervliet Arsenal and <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> by Rock Island Arsenal. The first pieces were delivered early in 1940, the production continued until 1943.|$|E
5000|$|Pretoria, Johannesburg, South Africa (2010), {{during a}} {{locomotive}} changeover, <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> ran away {{out of control}} for 12 miles (19 km) until they derailed at Pretoria. 7 injuries and 3 deaths were reported with a total damages to <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> of about R15,000,000 (£1,338,000).|$|R
50|$|On 21 April 2010, {{a luxury}} tourist train {{operated}} by Rovos Rail was at Centurion Station where the electric locomotive was being changed for a Class 25NC 4-8-4 steam locomotive. During <b>the</b> changeover, <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> ran away {{out of control}} for 12 mi until they derailed at Pretoria. The accident occurred outside the Blue Train depot. There were 59 passengers and thirty train staff on board <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b> Three of <b>the</b> train crew were killed, and about R15,000,000 (£1,338,000) of damage was done to <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b>|$|R

5|$|After an {{inspection}} by the Board of Trade, the railway opened to goods on 12 September 1854 and approval for <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> of passengers was given two days later. The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11am. The {{number of passengers}} had grown to about 650 {{by the time the}} train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12pm. Public services began the following day.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung {{to the side of the}} Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to the side of <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
5|$|The car {{numbers of}} the trains range from x001 to x132, where x depends on <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> type. Individual cars are {{assigned}} a 4 digit serial number. A complete six-car trainset consists of an identical twin set of one driving trailer(DT) and two motor cars(M1 & M2) permanently coupled together. For example, set 099/100 consists of carriages 3099, 1099, 2099, 2100, 1100 and 3100.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carriage</b> house, {{today the}} Ellwood House Museum's Education and Visitors Center, {{was built by}} Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for {{automobile}} repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur. The building originally had garage doors on both sides so cars could drive in one side {{and out the other}} side of the structure. The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E
