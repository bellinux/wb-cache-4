500|$|Nefarious was written, directed, {{produced}} and narrated by Benjamin Nolot, {{founder and president}} of Exodus Cry, the film's distributor. Nolot, who travelled to 19 countries to collect the film's content, said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] The film was officially released on July 27, 2011, with individual grassroots screenings also taking place. Laila Mickelwait, Exodus Cry's director of awareness and prevention, screened the film in several countries in an attempt to persuade governments to make laws similar to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which criminalizes the purchasing rather than the selling of sex. The film was released on home video on May 1, 2012.|$|E
500|$|The DSi helped {{maintain}} strong {{sales for}} Nintendo's handheld product line. The DSi accounted for 40 {{percent of its}} product line's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability. In the United States, the console's initial three-month sales surpassed those of the DS, DS Lite, and Wii. Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200,000 units for seven months after the DSi's April launch, while Wii sales diminished. Gamasutra estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles. In an October 2009 interview, Fils-Aimé announced that the DSi had sold 2.2 million units in the United States. He said, [...] "If you give the consumer great value in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> pay, they're willing to spend, and we say [...] based {{on the experience of}} launching the DSi". The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11.22 million units sold. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16.88 million of the 27.11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1, 2009 and ending March 31, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Filming of Nefarious {{was started}} in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan {{was to create a}} short film, but the project was {{expanded}} when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in Mike Bickle's International House of Prayer, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is not a day that goes by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." [...] He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's cinematographers. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and editor, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included Bill Oberst Jr., Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the film score for Nefarious after having worked on such other projects as 16 Blocks, Constantine, The Book of Eli, and Lost. As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to Nefarious.|$|E

This garnered objections. For example, generations of Cebuano speakers in northern Mindanao (Dipolog, Dapitan, Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental, coastal areas of Butuan) say that their ancestry traces back to Cebuano speakers native to their place and not from immigrants or settlers from the Visayas. Furthermore, they ethnically refer to themselves as Bisaya and not Cebuano, and their language as Binisaya.

40|$|Introduction "Integration of Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition" {{may be a}} {{surprising}} title for an ECAI- 94 workshop since most Machine Learning (ML) systems are dedicated to Knowledge Acquisition (KA). What could thus mean integrating ML and KA ? The {{answer lies in the}} difference between the approaches developed by what is referred to as ML and KA research. Apart from some major exceptions, such as learning apprentice tools [Mitchell et al., 1989], or libraries like Machine Learning Toolbox [MLT, 1993], most ML algorithms were described without any characterization in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> real application needs, in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could be effectively useful for. However, ML methods were applied to "real world" problems, but few general and reusable conclusions were drawn from these knowledge acquisition experiments. As ML techniques become more and more sophisticated and able to produce various forms of knowledge, the number of possible applications grows...|$|R
2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{are and what}} they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E
