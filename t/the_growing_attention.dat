50|$|In lipidomic research, a {{vast amount}} of {{information}} quantitatively describing the spatial and temporal alterations in the content and composition of different lipid molecular species is accrued after perturbation of a cell through changes in its physiological or pathological state. Information obtained from these studies facilitates mechanistic insights into changes in cellular function. Therefore, lipidomic studies play an essential role in defining the biochemical mechanisms of lipid-related disease processes through identifying alterations in cellular lipid metabolism, trafficking and homeostasis. <b>The</b> <b>growing</b> <b>attention</b> on lipid research is also seen from the initiatives underway of the LIPID Metabolites And Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS Consortium). and The European Lipidomics Initiative (ELIfe).|$|E

50|$|Toombs was {{admitted}} to the practice of law in Georgia in 1830, and served in the Georgia House of Representatives (1838, 1840-41, and 1843-44). His genial character, proclivity for entertainment, and unqualified success on the legal circuit earned Toombs <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>attention</b> and admiration of his fellow Georgians. On the wave of his growing popularity, Toombs won a seat to the United States House of Representatives (1844-53), and joined his close friend and fellow representative Alexander H. Stephens from Crawfordville, Georgia. Their friendship forged a powerful personal and political bond that effectively defined and articulated Georgia's position on national issues in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Toombs, like Stephens, emerged as a states' rights partisan, became a national Whig, and once the Whig Party dissolved, aided {{in the creation of the}} short-lived Constitutional Union Party in the early 1850s.|$|E
5000|$|Change in locally {{specific}} {{constructions of}} hegemonic masculinity {{has been a}} consistent theme of masculinity research, but given <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>attention</b> to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas {{for the construction of}} masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of international relations, and Connell proposed a model of [...] "transnational business masculinity" [...] among jet-setting corporate executives. Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analyzed at three levels: local, regional, and global. The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.|$|E
