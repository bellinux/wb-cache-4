5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|Ferking {{apparently}} {{could not}} tolerate Augvald's overlordship of Karmøy, {{and he went}} north with his army, meeting Augvald and his army at Skeie, near Avaldsnes. In the resulting battle there many fatalities, but no clear victor. The conclusive battle {{took place at the}} Field of Stava (Stavasletta), near Ferkingstad. Ferking and his men hid between two gorges, waiting for Augvald to appear. In the fierce battle that followed Augvald and his cow were among the many who lost their lives. When his two daughters saw that Augvald was dead, <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> into a river and drowned.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. <b>They</b> <b>jumped</b> from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> onto the heaving deck.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{advanced}} to the Super Bowl with two dominating wins. First, <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> to a 21-0 fourth quarter lead against the Minnesota Vikings and easily held off their meager comeback attempt in the final period for a 24-14 win.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges {{river was}} unusually dry at the Satichaura Ghat, and the British found it {{difficult}} to drift the boats away. General Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat off. There was some confusion, as the Indian boatmen jumped overboard after hearing bugles from the banks, and started swimming toward the shore. As <b>they</b> <b>jumped,</b> some fires on the boats were knocked over, setting a few of the boats ablaze.|$|E

25|$|After {{providing}} the Dodgers with bulletin board material, <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> on Cone for five runs in two innings {{in the second}} game of the playoffs to tie the series at a game apiece. After giving up the column, Cone came back with a scoreless ninth inning in a game three Met win and a complete game victory in game six; however, series MVP and 1988 Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser came back in game seven with the complete game shut out to lead the Dodgers to the 1988 World Series against the Oakland Athletics.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus {{was once}} {{captured}} by Etruscan pirates who mistook {{him for a}} wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins {{so that they would}} spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the {{advantage}} that the French had enjoyed in the action was suddenly reversed. Le Marchant led his dragoon guards {{out of the woods}} and they formed their ranks whilst accelerating into the charge. The 5th Dragoon Guards attacked with their squadrons in echelon, their left refused, and struck the deep and exposed left flank of the French formation to considerable effect. Simultaneously with Le Marchant's charge the 16th Light Dragoons, led by Cotton, appeared to Ponsonby's right-rear; <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> a stone wall in line, and also charged. The French cavalry were thrown into instant confusion and were swiftly broken.|$|E

25|$|Harry enjoyed {{betting on}} the horse races. They had first {{experienced}} smoking opium in Africa, and when their friend Constance knocked on their door late one evening, <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> at her invitation to join her at Drosso's apartment. Ready for bed, Caresse quickly put on a dress with nothing underneath. Invitations to Drosso's were restricted to a few regulars and occasional friends. The Drosso's apartment had been converted to an opium den, subdivided into small rooms filled with low couches and decorations befitting an Arabic setting. After that introduction, Harry dropped in at Drosso’s frequently and sometimes stayed {{away from home for}} days at a time.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters often carry {{personal}} self-rescue ropes. The ropes {{are generally}} 30 {{feet long and}} can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited {{in the deaths of}} two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.|$|E
25|$|But in {{the wake}} of the 1990 title, Racing Club had a hard time {{adapting}} to the professional era and started to decline, until they were relegated to Division 2 at the end of the 1995–96 season. <b>They</b> <b>jumped</b> back to the top tier in 1998 but went down again in 2000 and played in Division 2 for most of the next decade. In 2001 the rugby section split off from the general sports club to merge with the rugby section of US Métro, the Paris public transport sports club, to form the current professional concern, known as Racing Métro 92. Both Racing Club de France and US Métro retained their other amateur general sports sections.|$|E

25|$|After two wins {{to end the}} Twenty20 Cup, it {{was back}} to losing in the County Championship, going down to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge for their eighth loss in nine games. In the National League, however, <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> up to third place thanks to a five-wicket win over Worcestershire. However, they looked {{unlikely}} to advance further from that third place, as they went down to second-placed Middlesex at home in the National League, and Middlesex also defeated them in the County Championship encounter, as Glamorgan went down by an innings and 23 runs. They then achieved their second first-class draw of the season, in a three-day match with Bangladesh A where over half the match was lost to rain.|$|E
25|$|Despite four Yorkshire Phoenix run outs, {{and four}} maidens from Paul Hoffmann, the hosts {{still managed to}} score 214 all {{out in the first}} innings at Headingley, Anthony McGrath making 57 from number five. Scotland Saltires then crumbled to 154, former England all-rounder Craig White taking three Scottish wickets as only the hired-in man from Durham, Gavin Hamilton, managed some {{resistance}} with the bat. Hamilton, who had played ODI cricket for Scotland at the 1999 World Cup, made 60, but he was one of only two Scots to pass 20. Yorkshire continued their promotion charge, however, as <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> ahead of Somerset in the table and into second place. However, after this match, Yorkshire only won one of their remaining fourteen games.|$|E
25|$|The Mavericks' {{improvement}} was dramatic. <b>They</b> <b>jumped</b> to 36–46, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets {{for the eighth}} and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history, and {{the highest in the}} NBA that season. Many expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4–0 start, the 1995–96 season was a disappointment in about every conceivable way. For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy—he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.|$|E

25|$|The {{captured}} vessel {{turned out}} to be the brig Raposa, pierced for 16 guns but mounting only 12, and also carrying some coehorns, swivel guns, and small arms. She had a crew of 90 men, but her captain, Don Joaquin de la Cheva and most of his officers were ashore, with the result that there were only 75 men on aboard. The Spanish suffered five men killed, not including some who drowned when <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> overboard, and the senior officer on board and 25 men wounded, many mortally. The British had only seven men wounded. Dashwood sent all the Spanish wounded and prisoners ashore under a flag of truce as they could receive better care there. The British took the corvette into service as Raposa. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund presented each of the three lieutenants with a sword worth £50, and Midshipman Lamb with a sword worth £30.|$|E
25|$|Clayton Kershaw {{made his}} fifth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers on April 6 against the San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium, the first Dodgers pitcher to do so since Don Sutton started seven in a row from 1972 through 1978. Former Dodger Matt Kemp had two hits, including a double, against his former team to drive in all three runs for the Padres as <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> to the lead. Jimmy Rollins in his first regular season appearance with the Dodgers hit a three-run homer {{in the eighth inning}} as the Dodgers came from behind to claim a 6–3 win to start the season. In the second game, the Padres pounced on Dodgers reliever Chris Hatcher to score four-runs in the ninth inning and pull away for a 7–3 victory to even the series. In the last game, on April 9, Adrian Gonzalez had four hits in four at-bats, with three of them being solo homers as the Dodgers won 7–4. Gonzalez became the first player in MLB history to hit five home runs in his teams first three games.|$|E
500|$|Fire {{ships were}} used on several {{occasions}} throughout the period. In 332 BC Alexander the Great laid siege to Tyre, a coastal base of the Phoenicians. [...] In order to bring his siege engines within range, Alexander ordered the construction of moles. [...] The Tyrians responded by attacking the first mole with a large fireship, which destroyed it. [...] A large horse transport ship was packed with cedar torches, pitch, dried brush and other combustibles; above this were suspended cauldrons of sulfur, bitumen and [...] "every sort of material apt to kindle and nourish flame". [...] This was towed to the mole, and lit by the Phoenicians before <b>they</b> <b>jumped</b> overboard and swam away.|$|E
