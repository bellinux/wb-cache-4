An empiricist puts all propositions into two broad classes: analytic—true {{no matter what}} (e.g. tautology), and synthetic—derived from experience and thereby susceptible to confirmation by <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> (the <b>verification</b> theory of meaning). Empiricits hold that, in general, {{to arrive at the}} truth-value of a synthetic proposition, meanings (pattern-matching templates) must first be applied to the words, and then these meaning-templates must be matched against whatever it is that is being asserted.

And maybe I am seeing a blue cow—unless I am lying my statement is a TRUTH relative to the object of my (perhaps flawed) perception. But is the blue cow [...] "really there"?

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{intermediate}} graph representation for programs with specified target variables. These programs {{are intended to}} be processed by thirdparty applications such as verifiers, testers and analysers. The representation embodies two concepts. First, it is path-sensitive {{in the sense that}} there may be multiple nodes representing one program point so that infeasible symbolic execution paths can be excluded. Second, and more importantly, the graph is sliced with respect to the target variables. This key step is founded on the fact that slicing is more effective when there is path sensitivity. Compared to the traditional representation of Control Flow Graph, the new graph may be bigger (due to path-sensitivity considerations), or smaller (due to slicing). We show that the new graph is not much bigger in practice, if at all. The main result however concerns the quality of the new graph: we show, using a number of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> applications of <b>verification</b> and testing, that the new graph performs substantially better. ...|$|R

Biometric data is very privacy sensitive as it may contain information as gender, ethnicity and health conditions which should not be shared with <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> during the <b>verification</b> process.

The system performs verification in the encrypted domain using elliptic curve based homomorphic ElGamal encryption for high efficiency.
