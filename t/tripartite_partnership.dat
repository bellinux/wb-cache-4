5000|$|Tse Wen Chang ( [...] , born August 25, 1947) is an {{immunology}} researcher, {{whose career}} spans across academia and industry. His early research involving the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) pathway and antibody-based therapeutics {{lead to the}} development of omalizumab (also known as Xolair), a medication that has been approved for the treatment of severe allergic asthma and severe chronic spontaneous urticaria. Chang is a cofounder of Tanox, a biopharmaceutical company specialized in anti-IgE therapies for the treatment of allergic diseases. After Tanox's <b>tripartite</b> <b>partnership</b> with Genentech and Novartis was forged in 1996, Chang returned to his alma mater, the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and served as the Dean (1996-1999) of the College of Life Sciences.

5000|$|While the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy anti-IgE {{program was}} gaining momentum, Genentech {{announced}} in 1993 {{that it also}} had an anti-IgE program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases. Scientists in Genentech had made a mouse anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity {{similar to that of}} CGP51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody (the antibody was later named [...] "omalizumab"). This caused great concerns in Tanox, because it had disclosed its anti-IgE technology and sent its anti-IgE antibody candidate, which was to become CGP51901 and TNX-901, to Genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership. Having failed to receive reconciliation from Genentech, Tanox filed a lawsuit against Genentech for trade secret violation. Coincidentally, Tanox started to receive major patents for its anti-IgE invention from the European Union and from the U.S. in 1995. After a 3-year legal entanglement, Genentech and Tanox settled their lawsuits out-of-court and Tanox, Novartis, and Genentech formed a <b>tripartite</b> <b>partnership</b> to jointly develop the anti-IgE program in 1996. Omalizumab became the drug of choice for further development, because it had a better developed manufacturing process than TNX-901. A large number of corporate-sponsored clinical trials and physician-initiated case series studies on omalizumab have been planned and performed since 1996 and a large number of research reports, especially those of clinical trial results, have been published since around 2000, as described and referenced in other sections of this article.In 2007, Genetech bought Tanox at $20/share for approximately $900 Million.|$|E

40|$|How can the {{interests}} of extractive industries and indigenous communities in the Arctic be balanced through benefit sharing policies? This paper analyses how the international oil consortia of Sakhalin Energy and Exxon Neftegaz Limited (ENL) on Sakhalin Island in Russia have introduced benefit sharing through <b>tripartite</b> <b>partnerships.</b> We demonstrate that the procedural and distributional equity of benefit sharing depend on corporate policies, global standards, pressure from international financial institutions, and local social movements connected in a governance generating network. Sakhalin Energy was profoundly influenced by international financial institutions’ global rules related to environmental and indigenous people’s interests. The benefit sharing arrangement that evolved under these influences resulted in enhanced procedural equity for indigenous people, but has not prevented conflict with and within communities. In contrast, ENL was not significantly influenced by international financial institutions. Its more flexible and limited benefit sharing arrangement was shaped predominantly by global corporate policies, pressure from the regional government {{and the influence of}} Sakhalin Energy’s model.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{partnerships and}} their peculiarities, based on recent research from various disciplines, {{in the context}} of the large problems faced by (global) society. These problems are very complex, often cross national boundaries, and cannot easily be 'solved' by one single actor. Previous 'unilateral' attempts to address them have not been particularly successful, and there are limits to what a single actor can do. Cooperation also enables different actors to leverage their resources and know how. It is therefore that the past decades has seen a rapid growth and spread of several types of cross-sector collaboration: public-nonprofit; public-private; private-nonprofit; and <b>tripartite</b> <b>partnerships</b> involving government, companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The chapter first gives an overview of the rationale for cross-sector partnerships, and the advantages of partnerships for different actors involved. This is followed by an discussion of the complexity and diversity of contexts in which collaborative activities take place, and of the actors themselves, from a 'global-to-local' (development) perspective. Some of these aspects have been explored in the management literature, but deserve more attention in research and in the practice of partnerships. What has been examined somewhat more, although without a definite answer so far, is the effectiveness of partnerships in relation to the larger problem(s) to be solved. Some of the difficulties of assessing 'impact' will be indicated, accompanied by recent insights, considering different levels (macro, meso, micro) and roles of partnerships. Reflections on limitations and recent trends - including a possible move beyond partnerships - will be offered as well...|$|R

The disease results in systemic and neurological disability to its victims. At present, only four drugs are available for treatment of HAT. However, these drugs are expensive, limited in efficacy and are severely toxic, hence the need to develop new therapies. Previously, the short TbruGSK- 3 short has been validated as a potential target for developing new drugs against HAT. Because this enzyme has also been pursued as a drug target for other diseases, several inhibitors are available for screening against the parasite enzyme. Here we present the results of screening over 16, 000 inhibitors of human GSK- 3 β (HsGSK- 3) from the Pfizer compound collection against TbruGSK- 3 short. The resulting active compounds were tested for selectivity versus HsGSK- 3 β and a panel of human kinases, as well as their ability to inhibit proliferation of the parasite in vitro.

40|$|AbstractThe {{rapid growth}} of science and {{technology}} in Malaysia has changed the demand for graduates with strong soft skills. In 2006, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) directed all institutions of higher learning (IHL) to further enhance students’ soft skills through the “Kemahiran Insaniah” Curriculum in order to upgrade the students to meet the current scenario of competitive job market demand. Despite continuing efforts made to improve students’ soft skills, the industry commented that graduates had failed to master the soft skills needed in their employment. On top of this, efforts to improve soft skills among students will not be successful without a strong commitment and participation from the students themselves. This paper proposes a smart synergy model of smart tri-partite partnership among polytechnics-industry-students in the industrial training program. The main aim is to create a Smart <b>Tripartite</b> <b>partnership</b> among polytechnic-industry-students to improve the students’ soft skills.

We proposed a university (community-school) partnership model from our working experience with both community and school sectors in the CDF Projects for the development of children from disadvantaged background. The CDF Projects have the components of Targeted Saving, Mentorship Programme, and Personal Development Plan. Our Network, the Network for Health and Welfare Studies, was commissioned an evaluation study for the first batch of the community-based CDF Projects, an on-going action research study on a school-based CDF Project of the first batch, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Quality Mentorship Network on the development of a Quality Process Data Management system, translation of research outcomes into CDF Projects operation manual and training, and opening opportunities for student internship and training program implementation. Experiences accumulate through our long-term and deep involvement into work of the CDF Projects and they have prepared and led us into the unique role in supporting and achieving the goals of child development. Through the proposed <b>tripartite</b> model, <b>partnership</b> and collaborative research and practice work can be mapped out and university participation in the three components of the CDF Projects can be planned and expanded.
