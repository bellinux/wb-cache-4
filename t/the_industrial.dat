5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century.

Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
