25|$|Zionists {{launched}} an intense White House lobby {{to have the}} UNSCOP plan endorsed, and the effects were not trivial. The Democratic Party, {{a large part of}} whose contributions came from Jews, informed Truman that failure to live up to promises to support the Jews in Palestine would constitute a danger to the party. The defection of Jewish votes in congressional elections in 1946 had contributed to electoral losses. Truman was, according to Roger Cohen, embittered by feelings of being a hostage to the lobby and its 'unwarranted interference', which he blamed for the contemporary impasse. When a formal American declaration in favour of partition was given on 11 October, a public relations authority declared to the Zionist Emergency Council in a closed meeting:'under no circumstances should any of us believe or <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> won because of the devotion of the American Government to our cause. We had won because of the sheer pressure of political logistics that was applied by the Jewish leadership in the United States'. State Department advice critical of the controversial UNSCOP recommendation to give the overwhelmingly Arab town of Jaffa, and the Negev, to the Jews was overturned by an urgent and secret late meeting organized for Chaim Weizman with Truman, which immediately countermanded the recommendation. The United States initially refrained from pressuring smaller states to vote either way, but Robert A. Lovett reported that America's U.N. delegation's case suffered impediments from high pressure by Jewish groups, and that indications existed that bribes and threats were being used, even of American sanctions against Liberia and Nicaragua. When the UNSCOP plan failed to achieve the necessary majority on 25 November, the lobby 'moved into high gear' and induced the President to overrule the State Department, and let wavering governments know that the U.S. strongly desired partition.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E

Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because I really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{discussed}} the idea {{with other members}} of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] and [...] "Final Mission". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wildchild during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse for true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a [...] "bookworm" [...] while at the Academy and only becoming [...] "crazy" [...] once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] that he laughed when he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that [...] "It made us all <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever." [...] While Moore called the episode [...] "A Q Carol" [...] based on the original premise, but Piller was the one to suggest [...] "Tapestry" [...] as he said [...] "you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life".|$|E

"All the Small Things", {{released}} in early 2000, became {{an even bigger}} success— it crossed over from alt-rock radio to contemporary hit radio, peaking at number six on Billboard Hot 100 and {{number one on the}} Modern Rock Tracks chart. This track stayed {{at the top of the}} Modern Rock Tracks chart for eight weeks and remained in the top 10 for 20 weeks. It also peaked at number two on the official UK charts, and within the top ten in Italy, Ireland, Austria, Sweden and Australia. The music video for [...] "All the Small Things" [...] parodies boy bands and contemporary pop videos, and features the trio participating in choreographed dancing and dressing up as members of Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, and 'N Sync. [...] "I was a little surprised it went over so well," [...] recalled Marcos Siega, director of the clip, commenting that he felt it would offend viewers of Total Request Live (TRL) and boy band fans.

[...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers.

If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it."

2500|$|Overall, Farther Along had a {{much less}} {{cluttered}} sound than its predecessor, as guitarist and band leader Roger McGuinn noted to journalist David Fricke in 2000: [...] "It was as live {{as you can get}} in the studio. We didn't do a lot of overdubs, mostly just the vocals." [...] Nonetheless, while the album succeeded in countering the over-production present on Byrdmaniax, the band themselves weren't particularly satisfied with the finished product. [...] In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying [...] "When we finished it, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification." [...] Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating [...] "I felt that Farther Along was a good album, but it was under produced. It was done really rapidly and it suffered in under production as a reaction to Byrdmaniax." ...|$|E

She replied: [...] "I am one of them". Furthermore, in January 2016, Beckett claimed that Labour would need an [...] "unexpected political miracle" [...] if it were to win under his leadership, and [...] criticised Corbyn for failing to win back the trust of the electorate on welfare reform and mass immigration, saying: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the right policies towards immigration, but the simple thuggishness of the kind of Ukip and Conservative approach is easier to understand and we didn't overcome those communication difficulties ...

2500|$|In early 1996, Quo Vadis {{headed back}} into the studio and {{recorded}} their debut album with Pierre Rémillard, who had previously worked with Cryptopsy, as producer. On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. That {{may sound like a}} contradiction but that is the case. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge. I think we captured that quite well, at the same time setting free our artistic side. It's pretty weird. You have to listen to both to really understand." ...|$|E

He's stated [...] "We did the Who's Next tour {{for a year and a}} half, across the US, to Europe and back here again." [...] The tour created a bond between Heil and Who guitarist Pete Townshend, who commissioned Heil to create the quadraphonic sound system he had envisioned for the live tour after the release of their Quadrophenia LP. According to Heil, [...] "We set up two 15-channel Midas consoles together, put speakers in four corners and we were able to fly Roger's [...] voice around the room. When we did Madison Square Garden with Quadrophenia, the PA was enormous. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> on each side six to eight 15-inch speaker bins, six to eight radial horns, and about a dozen tweeters. We could get about 110dB to 115dB on that stage before feedback. And the Who loved it, man, because it was loud, and they loved loud." ...|$|E
