Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. [...] "For several years now, we have been listening to a bedtime story, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue."

The minister wrote that the people, especially the children, learned English with ease after they had learned to write Gaelic. The minister also gave some reasons why the people were keen to learn English, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> [...] "English being the language universally spoken by the higher classes, {{the mass of the}} people attach a notion of superior refinement to the possession of it". Half a century previously, Harry Robertson had praised the spirit of one watchmaker in the region, but added [...] "it is a pity that he can hardly read nor write, and hardly speaks English".|$|E

500|$|Steven Lisberger {{relocated}} to Boston, Massachusetts from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the 1970s {{to pursue a}} career in computer animation. Since the computer animation field was mainly concentrated in Los Angeles, Lisberger had very little competition operating on the East Coast: [...] "Nobody back then did Hollywood stuff, so there was no competition and no one <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we couldn't do it." [...] He later produced the American science fiction film Tron (1982) for Walt Disney Productions, the first computer animation-based feature film. Although the film garnered some critical praise, it generated only modest sales at the box office — the cumulative North American gross was just $33 million. Producer Sean Bailey, who saw the film with his father and Lisberger, was captivated by the finished product. Although Tron performed below Disney studio's expectations, it later developed a cult following, which fueled speculation of Pixar's alleged interest in creating a sequel, in 1999. Rumors of a Tron sequel were further ignited after the 2003 release of the first-person shooter video game, Tron 2.0. Lisberger hinted that a third installment could be in the works, depending on the commercial success of the game.|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{formulation}} of the idea is made difficult {{by the fact that}} physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current standard model of particle physics has 25 freely adjustable parameters with an additional parameter, the cosmological constant, for gravitation. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both quantum mechanics and general relativity are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a grand unified theory, string theory, or loop quantum gravity. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, [...] "the small value of the cosmological constant is <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Basis steps {{demonstrate}} that the simplest provable sentences from [...] are also implied by , for any [...] (The proof is simple, since the semantic fact that a set implies any of its members, is also trivial.) The Inductive step will systematically cover all the further sentences that might be provable—by considering each case where we might reach a logical conclusion using an inference rule—and shows that if a new sentence is provable, it is also logically implied. (For example, {{we might have a}} rule <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied.
