500|$|Executives who {{eventually}} {{escaped from the}} Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions {{in which they would}} confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies. Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in the Hole? You can't trust anybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Rankine plays as a striker and {{has been}} {{described}} as a target man, not being a prolific goalscorer, and he has said [...] "I just like to chip away and work as hard as I can and, hopefully, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> rewarded with goals". He has the [...] "ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems" [...] and is in possession of the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said [...] "He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in". York manager Martin Foyle said Rankine [...] "will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels." ...|$|E
500|$|A new costume was {{required}} for Ryan once Seven had the majority of her Borg implants removed. She wore a new silver jumpsuit for the following several episodes. During the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor", [...] director Jesús Salvador Treviño criticized the outfit, saying that [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasizing her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug"; she wore a corset-like device which gave her the appearance of mechanical ribs. Treviño praised Ryan's third costume, which replaced the silver jumpsuit, noting how it reduced her sexual characteristics: [...] "It is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> away from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning {{not only to the}} audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about".|$|E

500|$|Independent Film, Holley's debut solo album, was self-released by {{the singer}} in 2008. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD. Originally set for release on February 11, 2003, and later February 13, 2003, it was delayed several times, due to unspecified [...] "production issues". However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E

500|$|... "Between the Lines" [...] {{became the}} album's first single; it was {{released}} digitally on the band's Twitter page on March22, later peaking at {{number one on the}} Billboard Rock Songs chart.The music video for [...] "Between the Lines", [...] directed by Christopher Sims, was shot on April11 in Los Angeles, California, and premiered on Fuse TV's Top 20 Countdown on May 7.The song was written by Robert, with a guitar solo written by Dean. Robert was inspired by the 1960s rock groups, The Zombies and The Animals, and who had been picturing [...] "a '60s go-go beat and a girl in a miniskirt" [...] before Weiland changed the song's meaning with his lyrics. Dean commented on how Weiland had turned [...] "Between the Lines" [...] into a love song: [...] "Sometimes we don't feel musically what Scott does lyrically. He took it to an exciting place. It's pretty twisted." [...] Weiland's lyrics reflected on his relationship with his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, and his history with drug abuse. Speaking of the at-times strange lyrics, Weiland cited The Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] as an inspiration. [...] "Sometimes you throw together random words that phonetically sound good with the melody and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the meat of the song in the chorus." [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was originally the working title of the song, which Weiland incorporated into his lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the band's {{eventual}} return, Ed Droste noted, [...] "Coming {{back together}} {{to try to}} write and record was like being in junior high again – after you go away for the summer, {{the first couple of}} weeks are slightly awkward when you get back to school. <b>Then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back into the swing." [...] Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "The whole process with this record felt like starting over. We took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head kind of went out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Camerons {{have had}} four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, {{was born on}} 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare {{combination}} of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: [...] "The news hits you like a freight train... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> over that, because he's wonderful." [...] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.|$|E
2500|$|Treviño {{praised the}} {{subsequent}} changes to her costume {{in order to}} reduce its sexuality, saying that [...] "it is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> away from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about." [...] The later versions of her costumes still required 20 minutes to get into before filming could start, but Ryan said they were much more forgiving, [...] "In the silver costume, if I got goosebumps, you could see them. The brown costume is a thicker, stronger fabric. It's not quite so clingy, so the waist doesn't have to be cinched in." [...] That version of the costume also removed the vertical bones of the corset, which allowed Ryan to have greater flexibility while wearing it.|$|E

2500|$|Prominent {{evolutionary}} biologists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne {{have proposed}} various [...] "controversies" [...] {{that are worth}} teaching, instead of intelligent design. Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching flat earthism: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. [...] "If you give {{the idea that there}} are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children." [...] Tufts University Professor of Philosophy Daniel C. Dennett, author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, describes how they generate a sense of controversy: [...] "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Le Guin's {{feelings}} towards anarchism {{are closely}} tied to her Taoist beliefs and both ideas appear in her work. [...] "Taoism and Anarchism fit together in some very interesting ways and I've been a Taoist ever since I learned what it was." [...] She has participated in numerous peace marches and although she does not call herself an anarchist since she does not live the lifestyle, she does feel that [...] "Democracy is good but it isn't {{the only way to}} achieve justice and a fair share." [...] Le Guin has said: [...] "The Dispossessed is an Anarchist utopian novel. Its ideas come from the Pacifist Anarchist tradition – Kropotkin etc. So did some of the ideas of the so-called counterculture of the sixties and seventies." [...] She has also said that anarchism [...] "is a necessary ideal at the very least. It is an ideal without which we couldn't go on. If you are asking me is anarchism at this point a practical movement, well, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in the question of where you try to do it and who's living on your boundary?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rubber Soul was the group's first release not {{to feature}} their {{name on the}} cover, an {{uncommon}} tactic in 1965. The [...] "stretched" [...] effect of the cover photo came about after photographer Bob Freeman had taken some pictures of the group wearing suede leather jackets at Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, [...] "Ah! Can we have that? Can you do it like that?", to which Freeman said he could. The distinctive lettering was created by photographer Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album's title: [...] "If you tap into a rubber tree <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out." [...] The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to The Guardian, [...] "a staple of poster art for the flower power generation".|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a transmedia storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back in my day we'd have this payload delivered'. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, {{and he would say}} something like, [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
