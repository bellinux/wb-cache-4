5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> acting excellent, with <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> actors bringing the characters to life, {{thanks largely to}} David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E

40|$|This study {{opened up}} avenues for {{exploring}} the dismembering effects of trauma and the “re-membering” process of healing. Six participants engaged in a 60 - to 90 -minute semi-structured interview modelled after Elliot’s Change Interview. Utilizing the Listening Guide, the research team identified voices speaking about trauma and recovery. <b>The</b> <b>voices</b> were grouped into three categories: <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of trauma’s dismembering effects, <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of turning towards the pain, and <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of healing. Among <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of trauma’s dismembering effects were disconnection, dissociation, impasse, and pain. Voices of turning towards the pain included <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of active acceptance and of mourning. Voices of healing included <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of personal essence, integration, astonishment, agency, and calm and peace. Examining these voices, we traced patterns of shifting from fragmentation, aloneness, and numbness to wholeness, connection, and presence. This progression highlights the fulfilled potential of personhood through the transformational process of healing in therapy. TraumaHealingWholenessLifespan Integration therapyListening Guid...|$|R
