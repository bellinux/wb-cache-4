5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> flies {{with long}} glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe {{on the leading edge}} of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> is {{a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
40|$|In Belgrad Forest near Istanbul-Turkey we {{surveyed}} the <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl’s</b> distribution, population density and habitat preferences. The study area {{was divided into}} 18 sample areas, which are 2 x 2 km. We located a total of 93 <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix aluco L. 1758) : 34 pairs, 14 single males, 6 single females and 5 juveniles. <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> preferred deciduous old forest stands near streams and dams in Belgrad Forest. Also, their diet consisted mainly of Rodentia (93 %) and {{a small percentage of}} birds, amphibian and insects (7 %) ...|$|R

5|$|According to the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{the most}} common species' of birds found within the woods are mute swan, Canada goose, robin, green woodpecker, jay, nuthatch, lesser spotted woodpecker, greater spotted woodpecker, cuckoo, sparrowhawk, tree creeper, <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> willow tit and woodcock.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{include the}} barn owl, the <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> the northern goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, {{and common}} buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|E

50|$|With such an {{abundance}} of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle thrushes, <b>tawny</b> <b>owls,</b> song thrushes, great spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches.|$|R
5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (probably because of {{competition from the}} long-eared owl), and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> {{subspecies}} {{are often}} poorly differentiated, {{and may be}} at a flexible stage of subspecies formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour tone of the local habitat, {{and the size of}} available prey. Consequently, various authors have historically described between 10 and 15 subspecies. The currently recognised subspecies are listed below.|$|E

5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion of}} birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{completed}} in November 2009 found 50 types {{of trees in}} the gardens. Bats {{were found in the}} coach house during an ecological survey, but were not believed to be roosting there long-term. Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush, jay, wren, robin, kingfisher and <b>tawny</b> <b>owl.</b> Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs, grey squirrels and foxes. Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, {{white admiral}} and ringlet butterflies, and bird {{species such as}} sparrowhawks, <b>tawny</b> <b>owls,</b> great spotted {{woodpeckers}} and European green woodpeckers. Songbirds and sparrowhawks are popular sights.|$|R

5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European pine marten (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> {{and a much}} less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} mixed woodland, a willow plantation, hedges, ditches {{and an open}} area. Birds include <b>tawny</b> <b>owls,</b> great spotted {{woodpeckers}} and green woodpeckers. It {{is part of the}} proposed extended Thurrock Thameside Nature Park.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{investigated}} genetic parentage in a Swiss population of <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix aluco). To this end, we performed genetic analysis for six polymorphic loci of 49 avian microsatellite loci tested for cross-species amplification. We found one extra-pair young out of 137 (0. 7 %) nestlings in 37 families (2. 7 %). There was no intra-specific brood parasitism. Our {{results are in}} accordance with previous findings for other raptors and owls that genetic monogamy is the rule. Female <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> cannot raise offspring without a substantial contribution by their mates. Hence one favoured hypothesis is that high paternal investment in repro-duction selects for behaviour that prevents cuckoldry...|$|R
50|$|A day in {{the life}} of Britain's best-known bird reserve.Species seen: avocets, stone curlew, sand martins, baby <b>tawny</b> <b>owls,</b> dawn chorus (tits, treecreeper, finches, wren), reed and sedge warblers, nightingale, spoonbill, bittern, marsh harrier and common cranes.|$|R
5|$|The parents {{care for}} young birds {{for two or}} three months after they fledge, but from August to November the juveniles {{disperse}} to find a territory of their own to occupy. If they fail to find a vacant territory, they usually starve. The juvenile survival rate is unknown, but the annual survival rate for adults is 76.8%. The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild <b>tawny</b> <b>owl,</b> and of over 27years for a captive bird.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> has a {{geographical}} range {{of at least}} 10millionkm2 (3.8millionmi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000–2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but {{there is evidence of}} an overall increase. This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern. This species has expanded its range in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Ukraine, and populations are stable or increasing in most European countries. Declines have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Italy and Albania.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> hunts {{almost entirely}} at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight when it has young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up {{to the size of a}} young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake have been killed and eaten.|$|E
50|$|The wood is {{particularly}} {{known for its}} bluebells during April and May. Its flora also includes wood anemone, wood sorrel and several species of orchid, including bird's-nest orchids and white helleborine. It is home to <b>tawny</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
