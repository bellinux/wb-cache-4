40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{disagreement}} about what <b>the</b> mens <b>rea</b> for complicity is. Some courts take it to be the intention for the underlying crime to succeed while others take mere knowledge of the underlying crime to be sufficient. Still others propose that <b>the</b> mens <b>rea</b> for complicity tracks <b>the</b> mens <b>rea</b> of <b>the</b> underlying crime-the so-called "derivative approach. " However, as argued herein, these familiar approaches face difficulties. Accordingly, we have reason to continue our search for <b>the</b> elusive mens <b>rea</b> for complicity. This Article develops a new account of <b>the</b> mens <b>rea</b> for complicity, drawing on an older approach informed by agency law principles. In particular, I argue that a distinct attitude of condoning the underlying crime is best seen as <b>the</b> mens <b>rea</b> for complicity. This approach yields a more principled framework for determining when accomplice liability is warranted than the existing approaches do. Moreover, it demonstrates that certain reforms to the current legal regime are warranted. Most importantly, the law should recognize that complicity comes in degrees. While reforms of this sort have been previously proposed for reasons relating to causation, this Article argues that different levels of complicity must also be recognized on independent mens rea grounds...|$|R
