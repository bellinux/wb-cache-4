5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of wasps inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the syconium. The wasps of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around {{the same size as}} the pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the fig later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E

5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E

25|$|In heraldry, horseshoes {{most often}} occur as canting charges, {{such as in}} the arms of {{families}} with names like Farrier, Marshall and Smith. A horseshoe (together with two hammers) also appears in the arms of Hammersmith and Fulham, a borough in London. The arms of Rutland, England's smallest county, consist of a golden horseshoe laid over a field scattered with acorns. This references an ancient tradition in which every noble visiting Oakham, Rutland's county town, presents a horseshoe to the Lord of the Manor, which is then nailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Oakham Castle. Over the centuries, the Castle has amassed a vast collection of horseshoes, the oldest of which date from the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of PfEMP1 is to bind and attach RBCs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the blood vessels. The most important binding properties of P. falciparum known to date are {{mediated by the}} head structure of PfEMP1, consisting of DBL domains and CIDRs. DBL domains can bind {{to a variety of}} cell receptors including thrombospondin (TSP), complement receptor 1 (CR1), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), P-selectin, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and heparan sulfate. The DBL domain adjacent to the head structure binds to ICAM1. CIDRs mainly bind to a large variety of cluster determinant 36 (CD36). These bindings produce the pathogenic characteristics of the parasite, such as sequestration of infected cells in different tissues, invasion of RBCs, and clustering of infected cells by a process called rosetting.|$|E

25|$|The rock {{has several}} {{artificial}} cuts in its surface generally {{attributed to the}} Crusaders whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the Christian kings of Jerusalem placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed by Saladin. More recently, there has been speculation that several artificial features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusades. Archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer reports that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 cubits, precisely the width that the Mishnah credits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute foundation trenches on top of which {{the walls of the}} original temple were laid. However, according to Josephus there were 31 steps up to the Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet—the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.|$|E
25|$|Between December 1976 and March 1977, Gacy {{is known}} to have killed an {{unidentified}} young man estimated to be around 25 years old. An inscription upon a key fob found among the personal artifacts buried with this unknown victim suggests his first name may have been Greg or Gregory. His body was buried in the crawl space beneath the body of a 20-year-old named Jon Prestidge, a Michigan youth visiting friends in Chicago whom Gacy killed on March 15. After the murder of Prestidge, Gacy is believed to have murdered one further unidentified youth exhumed from his crawl space, although the timing of this particular youth's murder is inconclusive. The youth was buried parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Gacy's crawl space directly beneath the entrance to his home. The two victims murdered on the same day in May 1976 were buried alongside this youth, yet sequential burial patterns of three victims murdered in 1977 leave an equal possibility this particular victim may have been murdered in the spring or summer of 1977. All that is known about this youth is that he was aged between 17 and 21 years old and that he had suffered a fractured left collarbone before his disappearance.|$|E
25|$|PfEMP1 was {{discovered}} by Russell J. Howard {{and his colleagues at}} the US National Institutes of Health in 1984. Using the techniques of radioiodination and immunoprecipitation, they found a unique but yet unknown antigen from P. falciparum-infected RBCs that appeared to cause binding with other cells. Since the antigenic protein could only be detected in infected cells, they asserted that the protein was produced by the malarial parasite, and not by RBCs. The antigen was large and appeared to be different in size in different strains of P. falciparum obtained from night monkey (Aotus). In one strain, called Camp (from Malaysia), the antigen was found to have a molecular size of approximately 285 kDa; while in the other, called St. Lucia (from El Salvador), it was approximately 260 kDa. Both antigens bind to cultured skin cancer (melanoma) cells. But the researchers failed to confirm whether or not the protein actually was an adhesion molecule <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> blood vessels. Later in the same year, they found out that the unknown antigen was associated only with RBCs having small lumps called knobs on their surface. The first human RBC antigen was reported in 1986. Howard's team found that the antigens from Gambian children, who were suffering from falciparum malaria, were similar to those from the RBCs of night monkey. They determined that the molecular sizes of the proteins ranged from 250 to 300 kDa.|$|E
