40|$|Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) {{associated}} with blast exposure {{has become an}} increasing issue in military conflicts, with the most common exposure being improvised explosive devices. Exposure to blast accounted for 81 % of all casualties reported for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom combined. It {{has been identified as}} the ‘signature injury’ of the military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has been reported to be strongly {{associated with}} higher rates of Post–Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and physical health problems than with other injuries [1]. An observation common to most head blast exposure studies is the negative intracranial pressure occurring at the opposite site of initial blast wave transmission. This observation resulted in the hypothesis of intracranial cavitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), due to the negative pressures generated, as a potential brain injury mechanism. The purpose of this work was to develop an apparatus that generates controlled localized cavitation with similar loading encountered in head blast exposure to measure the cavitation pressure thresholds of fluids. Existing dynamic methods of generating cavitation presented limited loading capabilities, boundaries, and were not suitable for testing of biological fluids, such as CSF. Three iterations of <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> were developed, and the limitations identified were, potential cavitation nuclei and leakage at the seals and pressure gauge, variability in generated loading, and generation of diffuse cavitation. Due to the nuclei from the pressure gauge implementation, a validated numerical model of <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> was used to predict the negative fluid pressure in the chamber. The final proposed design for <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>incorporated</b> a novel closed cavitation chamber to generate localized cavitation resulting from a reflected compression pulse, which was generated by a spherical steel striker and Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) incident bar. Numerical models were developed and validated to model the PMMA incident bar with and without the PMMA chamber using 24 independent tests for strain and end velocity using iv varying striker geometry (cross–correlation: 0. 970 – 0. 997). Additionally, the numerical model of <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> including <b>the</b> chamber was developed and validated with 27 independent tests for strain and chamber end surface velocity (cross–correlation: 0. 921). Cavitation tests on distilled water were performed and a 50 % probability of cavitation was measured at a negative pressure of 3. 39 MPa ± 2 %, comparable to values found in the literature. Analysis of the experimental and numerical result trends demonstrated comparable chamber strain (R 2 : 0. 875) and chamber end surface velocity (R 2 : 0. 992). The predicted fluid pressures from the model were verified with a first–order approximation showing good agreement (R 2 : 0. 892). This novel <b>apparatus,</b> <b>incorporating</b> a closed confinement chamber integrated with a polymeric SHPB apparatus, was able to create localized fluid cavitation using a reflected compression wave, with loading comparable to blast exposure.

40|$|The Mars Gravity Biosatellite is an {{unprecedented}} independent spaceflight platform for gravitational biology research. With a projected first launch after 2010, the low Earth orbit satellite will support {{a cohort of}} fifteen 14. 5 - to 25. 5 -week-old female BALB/cByJ mice {{for up to five}} weeks. During this time, the spacecraft will rotate at a rate of 31. 6 rpm to generate Mars-equivalent artificial gravity of magnitude 0. 38 -g. Reentry capability will permit the return of live specimens to the Earth's surface at the culmination of the study. The proposed first mission aims to explore the physiological impacts on mice of 0. 38 -g. On board the Mars Gravity Biosatellite, a video acquisition and digitisation system will enhance in-flight collection of data on sensorimotor adaptation. As part of this thesis, a rotational ground control system has been designed and constructed at MIT. <b>The</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>incorporates</b> a video processing module similar to that baselined for the mission. It also features the first custom-designed gondola centrifuge that accommodates up to four singlyhoused rodents in flight-equivalent habitat modules. At a rotation rate of 31. 6 rpm, the centripetal acceleration experienced by each animal is less than 1. 07 -g. The 0. 34 m radius of rotation is equivalent to that of the orbital vehicle. A behavioural study with four BALB/cByJ mice explores the effects of chronic rotation alone and confirms that they can be quantified and therefore decoupled from the anticipated on-orbit effects of rotation-induced Mars-equivalent gravity. The results provide justification for the scientific validity of the Mars Gravity Biosatellite as a rotating spaceflight platform. In addition, details are presented on the design, implementation, test and operation of a two-mouse closed-loop environmental control and life support system (ECLSS). The ground-based assembly is colocated with the centrifuge, and the entire apparatus is enclosed within a sealed zero-pressure urethane/polyethylene membrane. It incorporates scaled-down versions of a subset of flight-equivalent atmospheric reconditioning subassemblies together with sensors, actuators and a computer to perform autonomous feedback-driven supervisory control. (cont.) Data is presented that validates a system that includes oxygen replenishment, carbon dioxide scrubbing via reaction with lithium hydroxide, ammonia removal using acidtreated activated charcoal, and humidity control with a custom-designed condensing heat exchanger. Results of a multi-week test represent an experimental proof-of-concept for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite's ECLSS strategy, showing good control of environmental parameters within specified ranges. The work presented in this thesis offers four primary contributions to aerospace biomedical engineering and rodent behavioural science: 1. Preliminary design and operations plans for the Mars Gravity payload. This thesis claims specific contributions in the areas of electronics, instrumentation, software and systems-level design of the payload module. 2. The first direct measurement of the influence of chronic rotation on mice in flight-like habitats at 31. 6 rpm. The first in-centrifuge use of video-based behavioural analysis. 3.

40|$|Ground {{tests of}} solid {{propellant}} rocket motors have shown that metal-containing propellants produce various amounts of slag (primarily aluminum oxide) which is trapped in the motor case, causing a loss of specific impulse. Although not yet definitely established, {{the presence of a}} liquid pool of slag also may contribute to nutational instabilities that have been observed with certain spin-stabilized, upper-stage vehicles. Because of the rocket's axial acceleration, absent in the ground tests, estimates of in-flight slag mass have been very uncertain. Yet such estimates are needed to determine the magnitude of the control authority of the systems required for eliminating the instability. A test rig with an eccentrically mounted hemispherical bowl was designed and built which incorporates a follower force that properly aligns the thrust vector along the axis of spin.

High performance aromatic polymers such as PEEK and PEK are widely used in composite and related applications. However, their high rate thermomechanical properties are not well understood. This thesis describes a series of investigations into their mechanical behaviour over a large range of strain rates (10 - 3 - 103 s- 1) and temperatures (20 - 200 ° C) which were carried out in order to more fully understand their properties and to assess the applicability of standard polymer property models to their behaviour. The experiments involved the design and construction of two novel sets of high rate test apparatus.

Voltammetry with a vibrating gold microwire electrode (VGME) {{is combined with}} a battery powered potentiostat and a processor board and is tested for in situ monitoring of copper (Cu) in coastal waters. The VGME was combined with solid state reference and counter electrodes to make a single vibrating probe which was rated up {{to a depth of}} 40 m. The measuring mode for Cu was square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry whilst dissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored by a linear sweep scan in a negative potential direction. The working electrode was reactivated between measurements using a suitable potential sequence. The novelties of this work are <b>the</b> field-testing of <b>apparatus</b> <b>incorporating</b> a VGME for copper monitoring, which eliminates the need for pumping and reagents, but has sufficient sensitivity for low ambient levels of copper, and the use of a novel potential sequence to stabilise the response over a long time period. <b>The</b> <b>apparatus</b> has a measuring time of about 6 weeks and a measuring frequency of 12 h− 1. Measurement is reagent-free and power use is low as no pump is required. Experiments are carried out to test the stability of response of the system at various temperatures and its robustness with respect to long-term copper monitoring. Preliminary data were obtained during autonomous deployment over several weeks on a buoy in the Irish Sea. Vertical movement of the buoy caused individual measurements to have a variability of about 15 %. It was found that longer term variability of the electrode could be minimised by normalisation of the Cu response over that of DO as the response was related to diffusion through the electrode surface which was similarly affected.

This thesis focuses on the reconstruction of <b>the</b> Canterbury GED <b>apparatus</b> (moved from Edinburgh, UK) and the requirements for modifying <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> to <b>incorporate</b> a mass spectrometer (MS) so diffraction and MS data can be obtained within a single experiment. The combined GED-MS system has been identified in previous work in the Masters group as a necessary development for studying the structure of short-lived species generated in situ.

While GED data for ketene generated from acetic anhydride has been refined, the species formed from the pyrolysis of Meldrum’s acid were determined to be too difficult to deconvolute without additional experimental data from MS. A computational study of possible ketene derivatives that could be studied with a GED-MS apparatus is also presented. Lastly, this thesis details a structural study of the gas-phase structures of tris(chloromethyl) amine and a family of substituted disilane systems which have been determined in the gas phase for the first time.

40|$|Behavioural {{assessment}} of experimental pain {{is an essential}} method for analysing and measuring pain levels. Rodent models, which are widely used in behavioural tests, are often subject to external forces and stressful manipulations that cause variability of the parameters measured during the experiment. Therefore, these parameters may be inappropriate as indicators of pain. In this article, a stepping-force analgesimeter was designed to investigate the variations in the stepping force of rats in response to pain induction. <b>The</b> proposed <b>apparatus</b> <b>incorporates</b> new features, namely an infrared charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a data acquisition system. The camera was able to capture the locomotion of the rats and synchronise the stepping force concurrently so that each step could be identified. Inter-day and intra-day precision and accuracy of each channel (there were a total of eight channels in the analgesimeter and each channel was connected to one load cell and one amplifier) were studied using different standard load weights. The validation studies for each channel also showed convincing results whereby intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 1 % and accuracy was 99. 36 – 100. 36 %. Consequently, an in vivo test was carried out using 16 rats (eight females and eight males). The rats were allowed to randomly walk across the sensor tunnel (the area that contained eight channels) and the stepping force and locomotion were recorded. A non-expert, but from a related research domain, was asked to differentiate the peaks of the front and hind paw, respectively. The results showed that of the total movement generated by the rats, 50. 27 ± 3. 90 % {{in the case of}} the male rats and 62. 20 ± 6. 12 % in that of the female rats had more than two peaks, a finding which does not substantiate the assumptions made in previous studies. This study also showed that there was a need to use the video display frame to distinguish between the front and hind paws in the case of 48. 80 ± 4. 01 % of the male rats and 66. 76 ± 5. 35 % of the female rats. Evidently the assumption held by current researchers regarding stepping force measurement is not realistic in terms of application, and as this study has shown, the use of a video display frame is essential for the identification of the front and hind paws through the peak signals...|$|R
