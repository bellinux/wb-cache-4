40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background: Since 1999 WHO has {{tracked the}} {{procurement}} of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for common infections, such as HIV, and has reported {{a significant increase}} in usage. In 1999 less than 40 % of all HIV diagnoses around the world were performed with rapid tests whereas the remaining 60 % were conducted with laboratory-based tests such as ELISAs. By 2009 over 80 % of HIV diagnoses had transitioned to using RDTs. Many of these tests abide by the ASSURED criteria, which outline standards for the evaluation of point-of-care diagnostics. Although these criteria endorse important characteristics such as low cost and rapid time-to-results, they do not provide quantitative measures to compare similar tests or guide RDT developers. In this analysis we aim to determine how different countries select HIV RDT(s), and to parse out which characteristics are responsible for their decisions. Understanding what drives the purchase and use of current HIV RDTs can help inform future designs and specifications for test developers. Methods: We analyzed data from The Global Fund's Price and Quality Reporting (PQR) database from January 2010 to January 2014. The sample consisted of 945 purchase records of HIV rapid diagnostic tests, including order date, purchasing country, and the number of tests purchased per order. The main independent variable was unit cost per test (in USD). Linear regression with random effects on country was used {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>test</b> <b>purchase,</b> a proxy for test usage, and test cost. Models were adjusted for country random effects and country and test-level covariates. Findings: This study included 945 purchase records of 38 different HIV RDTs from 93 countries. Our exploratory analysis showed that the characteristics that drive <b>test</b> <b>purchase</b> differ across a variety of settings. As cost is increased by just one $ 1. 00 overall purchase across all settings falls by 18. 7 % (95 % CI: − 25. 4 to − 16. 0 %). Other important driving characteristics were test time, maximum test storage temperature, and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run. When observations are stratified by country income level, the major driving factor is test cost and the degree of influence changes across strata. For low-income countries, every $ 1. 00 increase in test cost decreases test purchases by 62. 1 % (95 % CI: − 155 to − 39. 4 %). For high-income countries this decrease is only 10. 4 % (95 % CI: − 24. 7 to − 2. 7 %). Stratification by country HIV prevalence, high vs. low, again showed cost was a major driving factor, while test time, maximum test storage temperature, and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run were also significant indicators. For all of the analyses, test accuracy — sensitivity and specificity — was not found to significantly influence <b>test</b> <b>purchase</b> within this dataset. Findings: The ASSURED criteria are a good first step toward evaluating diagnostics for a variety of settings but this work presents the first quantitative assessment of which characteristics influence the purchase and usage of HIV RDTs. Overall, cost was a major driving factor, but the degree of its influence, and whether or not other factors were also important, varies between settings. This exploratory analysis can serve as a step toward better understanding what drives HIV RDT usage and help researchers and test developers design future tests that focus on these important characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Smoking habits in {{adolescence}} {{have a strong}} impact on smoking habits in adulthood. Nine of ten adult smokers started smoking {{before the age of}} eighteen. Thus, efforts to prevent the use of tobacco among minors are of great interest. In 1997 a minimum-age law of 18 years for purchase of tobacco was introduced in Sweden. The purpose of the age limit was to reduce the availability of tobacco to young people and hence ultimately to reduce the consumption of tobacco. The overall purpose of the work reported in the present thesis was: to study whether the Swedish minimum-age law for the purchase of tobacco has affected young people’s possibilities of buying tobacco to study how compliance with the minimum-age law for the purchase of tobacco can be improved to develop methods for following compliance with the minimum-age law for the purchase of tobacco. The empirical basis for the work was three different types of data: Test purchases of tobacco in 1996, 1999, 2002 and 2005 in Värmland, Västernorrland and Malmö. In total there were forty-eight test purchasers that made 3, 150 test purchases. Questionnaire surveys on tobacco habits and attitudes that were carried out in 1996, 2000 and 2005 among students in grades 7 and 9 of the compulsory school and in 1996 and 2000 in grade 2 of the upper-secondary school. All data was collected in the same three regions as the <b>test</b> <b>purchase</b> studies. The questionnaire was completed by a total of about 57, 000 students. Structured telephone interviews in 2005 with 28 key people in tobacco prevention work in the three regions. In conclusion, the thesis shows that: the minimum-age law introduced in 1997 for the purchase of tobacco products has limited adolescents’ opportunities for purchasing tobacco. Compliance with the minimum-age law is, however, still incomplete {{the most important factor in}} whether test purchasers were able to buy tobacco was whether there was an age control (as the law prescribes) compliance with the minimum-age law differs among the three regions studied. It is reasonable to assume that the regional differences can be related partly to regional differences in the effectiveness of the measures taken to ensure compliance with the law the proportion of daily smokers among students in grade 9 in the compulsory school declined from 1996 to 2005 in Värmland and Västernorrland but there was no change in Malmö the method used for <b>test</b> <b>purchase</b> of tobacco and further developed and adapted for Swedish conditions, functioned well for following compliance with the law...|$|E
40|$|Context: The European Union (EU) Tobacco Products Directive that bans {{sales of}} snus (a form of oral tobacco) in EU {{countries}} other than Sweden is currently under review. Major tobacco companies favour the ban being overturned. This study aims to explore {{compliance with the}} current ban on snus sales and examines the conduct of online snus vendors, including their compliance with two other EU Directives on excise and tobacco advertising and Swedish legislation banning sales of snus outside Sweden. Methods: To determine who is currently distributing snus via the internet in the EU, searches were carried out in Google, followed by searches in the WHOIS and Amadeus databases. Five online <b>test</b> <b>purchases</b> of snus were made in each of 10 EU Member States using a standardised protocol. Feedback from the <b>test</b> <b>purchases</b> and further analysis of the websites accessed for <b>test</b> <b>purchases</b> were used to critically examine snus retailers' conduct. Results: The majority of online vendors operate from Sweden and target non-Swedish EU citizens. Test purchases were successfully made in all 10 EU Member States; of 43 orders placed, only two failed. Age verification relied only on self-report. The majority of sales applied Swedish taxes, contrary to EU requirements. Copious sales promotion activities, many price based, are incorporated in these websites contravening the EU regulation, and three <b>test</b> <b>purchases</b> were delivered with gifts. Conclusions: Snus is currently being sold on the single market via the internet in contravention of Swedish legislation and three EU Directives. The apparent willingness {{of the tobacco industry}} to contravene EU and Swedish legislation and profit from unlawful sales raises questions about their status as stakeholders in consultations on future policy developments. The findings highlight how national and regional tobacco control legislation can be undermined in an increasingly globalised world...|$|R

From the time of the commencement of Section 47 in 2004, until the end of 2013, a total of 251 prosecutions have been taken by the HSE, resulting in 263 convictions. In relation to the sale of tobacco to minors, the HSE undertakes compliance checks, also known as test purchases, in retail outlets to determine if retailers will sell tobacco products to minors. The HSE’s <b>test</b> <b>purchase</b> programme, together with associated retail audits, have highlighted a significant ongoing noncompliance issue. As a result, there have been 43 prosecutions with 33 convictions between 2009 and 2013. These were mainly in respect of licensed premises including pubs, nightclubs and hotels. In recent years, more than 50 per cent of prosecutions have related to smoking areas in licensed premises, with a number of owners and proprietors having been prosecuted and convicted on multiple occasions.

40|$|Background: New psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) are on offer worldwide online, {{in order}} {{to shed light on}} the purity and price of these substances in the European Union, a research collaboration was set up involving France, United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Poland. Methods: Per country, around 10 different NPS were test purchased from different webshops. Then, chemical analysis of NPS was done with according reference standards to identify and quantify the contents. Results: In contrast to what is generally advertised on the webshops (> 99 %), purity varied considerably per test purchased NPS. Several NPS were mislabelled, some containing chemical analogues (e. g. 25 B/C-NBOMe instead of 25 I-NBOMe, pentedrone instead of 3, 4 - DMMC). But in some cases NPS differed substantially from what was advertised (e. g. pentedrone instead of AMT or 3 -FMC instead of 5 -MeO-DALT). Per gram, purity-adjusted prices of cathinones differed substantially between three countries of <b>test</b> <b>purchase,</b> with Poland being the least expensive. Synthetic cannabinoids were relatively the most expensive in the Czech Republic and least expensive in the UK. Conclusions: The current findings provides a snapshot of the price and chemical contents of NPS products purchased by different countries and in different webshops. There is a potential danger of mislabelling of NPS. The great variety in price and purity of the delivered products might be the result of the market dynamics of supply and demand and the role of law enforcement in different European countries...|$|E
