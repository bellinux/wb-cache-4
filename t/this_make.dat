25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the exact {{function}} of these areas in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The areas activated during TOT may vary depending {{on the nature of the}} target word. For example, if the target word is a person's name, the fusiform face area will likely show activation as the rememberer processes the person's face. Problems like <b>this</b> <b>make</b> it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure. The anterior cingulate cortex is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state. The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.|$|E

Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, [...] "when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror." [...] Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, [...] "'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going home, you were to find yourself sitting at your own table [...] [...] [...] would not <b>this</b> <b>make</b> a powerful impression on your mind?" ...|$|E

In June 2010, she begins {{receiving}} threats via text messages and emails, {{telling her to}} stay away from the university. She is later followed by an unseen person in a car. Susan later spots the car outside her house and she is very frightened. The cyber bully brings up some of Susan's personal issues within their threats and <b>this</b> <b>make</b> her feel vulnerable. They also make places that Susan has previously felt safe in, feel unsafe. Of this Woodburne said [...] "To feel so vulnerable in your own neighbourhood would be just awful. I think I would be equally frightened". As Susan suffers from multiple sclerosis, the stress has a big impact upon her health. Woodburne said that Susan is usually a very strong person mentally, but she feels out of control because the situation is distressing her. She becomes a victim. Susan tries to stand up to the bully and refuses {{to stay away from}} the university. However, when she arrives for her lesson, she receives another threatening message. This terrifies her and she locks herself in the toilets.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{forensic}} leads left by {{the assassin}} were the two bullets fired, identified as Winchester-Western [...]357 Magnum 158 grain metal piercing. Both bullets matched the lead fragments found in the clothing of Olof and Lisbet Palme. Because the weapon was a revolver (which does not automatically eject cartridge cases) there were no cases to recover for ballistic examination – only the two bullets recovered from the street. From the bullets' lack of certain characteristic deformations, investigators concluded they had been fired from a barrel no shorter than four inches; thus the murder weapon {{would have been a}} conspicuously large handgun. The singularly most used weapon for this type of ammunition is the Smith & Wesson [...]357, which is why great efforts have been made to locate a weapon of <b>this</b> <b>make.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the music}} {{historian}} Daniel Heartz, there has been considerable controversy concerning Gluck's native language. Gluck's protégé in Vienna, the Italian-born Antonio Salieri, says in his memoirs (translated into German by Ignaz von Mosel), that [...] "Gluck, whose native tongue was Czech, expressed himself in German only with effort, and still more so in French and Italian...." [...] Gluck's first biographer, Anton Schmid, accepted that Gluck spoke Czech, but thought Salieri incorrect, proposing instead that Gluck learned Czech in Prague. Heartz writes: [...] "More devious manoeuvres have been attempted by Gluck's German biographers of this [...] century, while the French ones have, without exception, taken Salieri at his word. Arend objected that not a single letter written in Czech can be found, to which Jacques-Gabriel Prod’homme countered that no letters written by Liszt in Hungarian were known either, but does <b>this</b> <b>make</b> him a German?" [...] Hans Joachim Moser wanted a lyric work in Czech as proof. In fact, the music theorist Larent Garcin, writing in 1770 (published 1772) before Gluck arrived in Paris, included Gluck in a list of several composers of Czech opéras-comiques (although such a work by Gluck {{has yet to be}} documented).|$|E
