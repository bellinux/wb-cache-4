40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} levels of serum cytokines, T {{lymphocyte}} subsets and STAT 3 in patients with herpes zoster {{as well as the}} intervention effect of mouse nerve growth factor. Methods: A total of 102 patients with herpes zoster were selected as observation group and received mouse nerve growth factor intervention, and 100 cases of normal people who received physical examination in our hospital during the same period as the healthy control group. The levels of serum Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines, IgG subclass and complements and T lymphocyte subsets as well as STAT 3 function of observation group before and after treatment and healthy control group were detected. Results: Serum IL- 2 and γ-IFN levels of observation group after treatment were higher <b>than</b> those <b>before</b> treatment while IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10 and TNF-α毩 levels were lower <b>than</b> those <b>before</b> treatment (P< 0. 05); serum IgG 1, IgG 3, IgG 4, C 3 and C 4 values of observation group after treatment were higher <b>than</b> those <b>before</b> treatment while IgG 2 value was lower <b>than</b> that <b>before</b> treatment (P< 0. 05); CD 3, CD 4 and CD 4 /CD 8 levels of observation group after treatment were higher <b>than</b> those <b>before</b> treatment while CD 8 level was lower <b>than</b> that <b>before</b> treatment (P< 0. 05); STAT 3, p-STAT 3 and JAK 2 expression levels of observation group after treatment were lower <b>than</b> those <b>before</b> treatment (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: There are abnormal immune system and STAT 3 signaling pathway function in patients with herpes zoster, and mouse nerve growth factor intervention can restore multisystem balance and accelerate disease rehabilitation, and has positive clinical significance...|$|R
