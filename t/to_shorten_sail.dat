60|$|An order <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> {{stopped the}} {{conversation}} at this point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{a little}} ahead of me," [...] the captain shouted. [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> a bit. We {{have got to}} fight those gunboats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{find our}} equal here!" [...] said Griffith to the stranger. [...] "The ninety is heaving up again like a mountain; {{and if we}} {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> at this rate, she will soon be down upon us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're goin' {{to catch}} it," [...] he said, hurriedly, {{as he passed}} forward; [...] "tumble up, there; tumble up; all hands <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sails.</b> Hand down the royals, and furl the t'gallant sails, Mr Williams, (to the first mate,) and look alive." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{coast of}} Tarbert Bay is rocky and the cliffs are fringed with young firs, the village itself being an {{extremely}} tranquil and beautiful place. The parish church occupies a fine situation. Overlooking the harbour are {{the ruins of}} a castle built by Robert I of Scotland in 1326. The isthmus connecting the districts of Knapdale and Kintyre is little more than one mile wide, and boats once used to be dragged across to the head of West Loch Tarbert, a narrow sea loch nearly ten miles long. A proposal to cut a canal across <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> the <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> Islay and Jura has never progressed further.Tarbert is famous for its seafood and hosts a seafood festival every year.|$|R
60|$|While Clay traced her {{movements}} {{as far as}} they could be learned, the Cetacea was slowly working north. She met with light, baffling winds, and calms, and then was driven into a lonely inlet by a fresh gale. Here she was detained for some time, and adverse winds still dogged her course when she put to sea again, though they were no longer gentle, but brought with them a piercing rawness from the Polar ice. Her crew grew anxious and moody as they stubbornly thrashed her <b>to</b> windward under <b>shortened</b> <b>sail,</b> for every day at sea increased the strain on their finances and the open-water season was short.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as we}} {{got over}} the bar, I gave the pilot my package, and he got into his boat. It was not {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> {{in order to do}} this, for the vessel's way did not exceed five knots.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ere it is," [...] {{said the}} young pilot, pausing {{at the top}} of the staircase, near the {{entrance}} to a very dark passage. [...] "Keep 'er 'ead as she goes, but I'd recommend you <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> mind your 'elm, an 'ave the anchor ready to let go." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first mate}} {{was in charge}} of the deck and, so far, he had given no orders <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b> Ever and anon a sail would crack in the wind and the bark would give a plunge in the sea. Dave walked forward to where Billy Dill stood by the rail, {{watching}} the sky anxiously.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as the sun}} {{dipped into}} the watery track of the Montauk, most of the cabin {{passengers}} again appeared on deck, {{to take a look}} at the situation of the two vessels, and to form their own conjectures as to the probable result of the adventure. By this time the Foam had tacked twice, once to weather upon the wake of her chase, and again to resume her line of pursuit. The packet was too good a ship to be easily overtaken, and the cruiser was now nearly hull-down astern, but evidently coming up at a rate that would bring her alongside before morning. The wind blew in squalls, a circumstance that always aids a vessel of war, as the greater number of her hands enables them <b>to</b> make and <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> with ease and rapidity.|$|R
60|$|Thus did the Margaret <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> {{and thus}} did she yield {{her to the}} great galleys of Spain.|$|R
60|$|The {{superiority of}} sailing, which a ship fitted for war {{possesses}} over one employed in commerce, proceeds {{from a variety}} of causes. The first is {{in the construction of the}} hull, which in the one is as justly fitted, as the art of naval architecture will allow, to the double purposes of speed and buoyancy; while in the other, the desire of gain induces great sacrifices of these important objects, in order that the vessel may be burthensome. Next comes the difference in the rig, which is not only more square, but more lofty, in a ship of war than in a trader; because the greater force of the crew of the former enables them to manage both spars and sails that are far heavier than any ever used in the latter. Then comes the greater ability of the cruiser <b>to</b> make and <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> since a ship manned by one or two hundred men may safely profit by the breeze to the last moment, while one manned by a dozen often loses hours of a favorable wind, from the weakness of her crew. This explanation will enable the otherwise uninitiated reader to understand the reason why Ludlow had hoped the coming squall would aid his designs on the chase.|$|R
6000|$|Spike gave a long, low whistle, {{after his}} fashion, {{and he walked}} away from the females, with the air of a man who wanted room to think in. Half a minute later, he called out--"Stand by <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> boys. Man fore-clew-garnets, flying jib down haul, {{topgallant}} sheets, and gaff-topsail gear. In with 'em all, my lads--in with everything, with a will." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{vessel was}} now to {{windward}} {{and coming up}} rapidly; <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> they must first round up the boat, for which they no longer had room. A few moments later a fiercer blast swept suddenly down and the water boiled white between the bark and the sloop. The latter's deck dipped deeper until {{the lower part of}} it was lost in streaming froth. Carroll made an abrupt movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jest {{look at the}} chart, Captain Crutchely," [...] put in Hillson--"a regular Tower Hill chart as {{ever was}} made, and you'll see {{there can be no}} white water hereabouts. If a man is <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> and haul his wind, at every dead whale he falls in with, in these seas, his owners will have the balance {{on the wrong side of}} the book at the end of the v'y'ge!" ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly the {{schooner}} drew nearer, still heading {{directly for}} the cove, and <b>shortening</b> <b>sail</b> {{only when she}} was inside the outer point of land.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{had better}} begin <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> Mr. Mulford," [...] the captain at length most reluctantly remarked. [...] "We might give the chap the slip, perhaps, by keeping close in under Porto Rico, {{but he would}} give us a long chase, and might drive us away to windward, when I wish to keep off between Cuba and Jamaica. He's a traveller; look, how he stands up to it under that could of canvas!" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were within}} two {{miles of the}} ship {{when he saw the}} sailors talking earnestly {{together}} and looking towards the shore. Glancing round he saw that the tops of the hills were enveloped in clouds, a sign, as experience had already taught him, of the approach of a gale. The brig, which had evidently not noticed the boat, had also observed the threatening aspect of the clouds, and as Stephen again looked ahead, began <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
60|$|As we have said, {{the crew}} and passengers, {{numbering}} thirty-four, were armed to the teeth, and they had stood by the halyards during the chase with drawn creases, swearing to kill any one who should attempt <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b> These now appeared {{for a moment as}} though they meditated resistance, but the irresistible dash of the sailors seemed to change their minds, for they submitted without striking a blow, though many of them were very reluctant to give up their swords and knives.|$|E
6000|$|Ordering {{the ship}} to be kept on towards the port, he <b>shortened</b> <b>sail</b> within easy distance, so as to glide slowly by, and seizing the trumpet, thus spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naught, Señor, {{unless it}} be that the Pinta is {{lessening}} her canvas, and the Niña is already closing with our fleet consort--nay, I now see the latter <b>shortening</b> <b>sail</b> also!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis time {{then that}} we were busy, for he is <b>shortening</b> <b>sail,</b> and as he nears so fast we may expect {{to hear from him}} every minute; what do you propose, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was, however, no resistance. The {{crew of the}} brig were as {{numerous}} as the boarders, but the successes of the Chilians had created such an effect that the captain cried out, as they leaped on board, that they surrendered. Stephen’s first order {{was to get the}} cutter up, and tackles were soon hooked on to her, and she was raised from the water and laid bottom upwards on deck. While this was being done the Peruvian crew were ordered <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “This {{drove her}} bows-under through the seas. Still {{they came up}} to us, {{but they were also}} {{plunging}} so heavily that they too were unable to fire a gun. Presently we had one on each side of us, with less than half a mile interval between us. The third was {{a quarter of a mile}} further away. The situation was a very unpleasant one, for now that they were up to us, they would be able <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> a little and occasionally fire at us with their broadside guns. Cochrane gave orders for the whole crew to be ready <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> when he gave the word, and that every sail should come down simultaneously. It was a critical movement, but it was well executed. Cochrane himself shouted the orders, and in a moment down came every sail. The helm at the same moment was put a-weather. Had it not been for the hawsers with which we had stayed the masts, everything must have gone out of her as we wore round, rolling in the trough of the sea. As soon as she was round, up went her sails again, and we went off on the opposite tack to that on which we had before been running.|$|E
6000|$|The {{ship was}} off Bedlow's, {{and the pilot}} had begun <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> when a {{schooner}} crossed our fore-foot, beating down. I had been too much occupied with the general movement of the bay, to notice one small craft; but, this vessel happening to tack quite near us, I could not but turn my eyes in her direction. At that instant I heard a shout from Neb, who was furling one of the royals. It {{was one of those}} irrepressible [...] "nigger gollies" [...] that often escaped from the fellow involuntarily.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} we had got to the ship, which had <b>shortened</b> <b>sail,</b> and the cap’n was {{standing}} by the side, looking down upon the stranger with a big, kind smile which nearly sent him crazy.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true; {{but how can}} we help {{ourselves}} just now? We can't <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> {{because there}} would be nothing left, and we're bound to run ahead of the waves, small as they are, or be swamped." ...|$|R
60|$|With the {{obedience}} {{that was}} natural to her, Kathleen went down at once, {{and the captain}} made everything as snug as possible, battening down the hatches and <b>shortening</b> <b>sail</b> so as <b>to</b> be ready for whatever might befall.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no mistaking}} all this. We were seen, and chased; {{everything}} on board the frigate being instantly and accurately trimmed, [...] "full and by." [...] She looked up into our wake, and I knew must soon overtake a heavily-laden ship like the Dawn, in the style {{in which she was}} worked and handled. Under the circumstances, therefore, I motioned Marble to follow me aft, where we consulted together, touching our future proceedings. I confess I was disposed <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail,</b> and let the cruiser come alongside; but Marble, as usual, was for holding on.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{an end of}} the monsoon," [...] Fairclough said. [...] "I am {{just going}} <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b> There is no saying which way the wind will come. The glass is falling fast but, of course, that is only to be expected. I think, if you are wise, after breakfast you will take off that drill suit, and get into {{something}} better calculated to stand rough weather; for that we are sure to have, and any amount of rain. That is always the case, at the changes of the monsoon.|$|E
60|$|The {{signal was}} given and understood. A {{quarter of an}} hour later, the Poughkeepsie began <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>sail.</b> Then Wallace {{stationed}} himself in the cutter, in the centre of one of the passages, signalling the ship to come on. Ten minutes later still, the noble craft came into the haven, passing the still burning light, with her topsails just lifting, and making a graceful sweep under very reduced sail, she came to the wind, very near the spot where the Swash had lain only ten hours before, and dropped an anchor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, {{you are a}} gay old gentleman!" [...] said Jekyl, {{relaxing}} his pace; [...] "and if we must be fellow-travellers, though I can see {{no great}} occasion for it, I must even <b>shorten</b> <b>sail</b> for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I had {{it worse}} than that the last time I came round the Horn. I think we shall be <b>shortening</b> <b>sail</b> again before long. The clouds are banking up to the south-west. She is a good sea-boat, isn't she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will get}} the upper sails off at once, Mr. Johnson. These storms come so {{suddenly}} off the coast that it is as well to lose no time in <b>shortening</b> <b>sail</b> when one sees any indication of such a change." ...|$|R
