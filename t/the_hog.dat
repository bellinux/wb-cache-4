5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hog</b> Island sheep is a feral breed, {{descended from}} sheep {{abandoned}} on Hog Island in the 1930s and 1940s. It {{is believed that}} the breed was descended from the Merino breed, among others, possibly the Improved Leicester or other English breeds.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hog</b> Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the agricultural, hunting/fishing, forestry, {{and mining}} {{industries}} made up 5.46% {{of the industry}} in Juniata County. Livestock farming was more popular in the county than crop cultivation. In 2002, the egg and poultry industry in the county generated $32 million in sales (the 7th highest of the Pennsylvania counties) and the dairy industry generated $17 million in sales (the 23rd highest of the Pennsylvania counties). <b>The</b> <b>hog</b> and pig industry generated $7 million and the cattle industry generated $4 million in sales (the 10th and 27th highest of Pennsylvania counties, respectively). The county's grain industry generated $1 million (the 35th highest of Pennsylvania counties). The county is the fourth most prolific poultry-producing county in Pennsylvania. In addition to the aforementioned industries, there are also small-scale clothing manufacturing businesses in the county.|$|E
5|$|The next {{transport}} of sheep to North America {{was not until}} 1607, with the voyage of the Susan Constant to Virginia. However, the sheep that arrived in that year were all slaughtered because of a famine, and a permanent flock was not to reach the colony until two years later in 1609. In two decades' time, the colonists had expanded their flock {{to a total of}} 400 head. By the 1640s there were about 100,000 head of sheep in the 13 colonies, and in 1662, a woolen mill was built in Watertown, Massachusetts. Especially during the periods of political unrest and civil war in Britain spanning the 1640s and 1650s which disrupted maritime trade, the colonists found it pressing to produce wool for clothing. Many islands off the coast were cleared of predators and set aside for sheep: Nantucket, Long Island, Martha's Vineyard and small islands in Boston Harbor were notable examples. There remain some rare breeds of American sheep—such as <b>the</b> <b>Hog</b> Island sheep—that were the result of island flocks. Placing semi-feral sheep and goats on islands was common practice in colonization during this period. Early on, the British government banned further export of sheep to the Americas, or wool from it, in an attempt to stifle any threat to the wool trade in the British Isles. One of many restrictive trade measures that precipitated the American Revolution, the sheep industry in the Northeast grew despite the bans.|$|E
50|$|The Razorbacks {{also had}} the third-best scoring defense and tied for the fourth-best pass defense. <b>The</b> <b>Hogs,</b> along with <b>the</b> Indiana Hoosiers, gave up only 89.5 yards per game through the air, and <b>the</b> <b>Hogs</b> only {{surrendered}} 8.6 points per game.

25|$|Compared to <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> deer, the chital {{has a more}} cursorial build. The antlers and brow tines {{are longer}} than those in <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> deer.

The chital is darker and has several white spots, whereas the fallow deer has white splotches. The chital has a prominent white patch on its throat, while the throat of the fallow deer is completely white. The hairs are smooth and flexible.|$|E

25|$|The {{hedgehog}} protein {{appears to}} have evolved in two sections, the N-terminal domain (hedge) and the C-terminal domain (hog), that only later were spliced together into a single transcriptional unit. <b>The</b> <b>Hog</b> domain contains a sequence called Hint (Hedgehog INTein), which is similar in sequence and function to bacterial and fungal inteins. <b>The</b> <b>Hog</b> domain is present in many eukaryotic branches, i.e. red algae, mosses, dinoflagellates, jakobids, and other single cell eurkaryotes. Choanoflagellates contain a gene named hoglet that also encodes the hedgehog C-terminal domain Hog domain. However, Choanoflagellates and lower eukaryotes do not contain any regions similar to the hedge domain, suggesting that hog evolved first. Poriferans have both hedge-like proteins (termed hedgling) and hog-like proteins, but they exist as two completely separate transcriptional units. Cnidarians contain the hedgling and hog genes, but also have a complete hedgehog gene, indicating that hedge and hog were spliced into hedgehog after the last common ancestor of poriferans and cnidarians. Bilaterians do not contain hedgling genes, suggesting that these were lost by deletion before this branch split from the other metazoans. However, Hog domain-containing genes without a Hedge domain are present in several bilaterian branches. They are found in lophotrochozoa and nematodes. While Enoplea nematodes also have a bona-fide Hedgehog, the branch leading to C. elegans has lost hedgehog, but has dramatically expanded <b>the</b> <b>Hog</b> genes.|$|E

These populations continue to expand, and now are pervasive in almost all land resource areas of <b>the</b> state. Wild <b>hogs</b> have a noted presence in the ranching and farming industry. This presence is both biophysical and socioeconomic in nature. <b>The</b> <b>hogs</b> financially influence agriculture as both a valuable asset and expensive liability. The economic presence of this influence reflects opposing personal preferences which play an important part in opposing valuations. Biological information is available which concerns <b>the</b> <b>hogs,</b> but no research has centered specifically around the economic effects of <b>the</b> <b>hog's</b> presence upon agricultural producers. To properly perform any economic analysis of wild <b>hog</b> impacts on <b>the</b> state's agricultural producers, good data was needed and became a primary focus of this study. A second need and focus of the study was the employment of enterprise budgeting as an economic research method to discover values for the positive and negative financial effects of <b>the</b> <b>hogs.</b> These methods were used to yield sound values for the economic effects of <b>the</b> wild <b>hogs</b> on <b>the</b> Texas agriculture producers which were the focus of this study. This research effort demonstrates the economic effects of wild hogs on eight selected Texas agricultural producers. An intensive survey was conducted which involved gathering primary data which focused on <b>the</b> effects <b>the</b> <b>hogs</b> have on <b>the</b> respondent's operations. This data was used to construct both full and partial combination effect enterprise budgets for the respondent's agriculture enterprises. These budgets yield values for the benefits and damages that result from <b>the</b> <b>hog's</b> growing influence on landowners / managers. The values for the economic effects of <b>the</b> <b>hogs</b> are presented and discussed in an attempt to offer information and alternatives which may help efficiently manage populations of <b>the</b> <b>hogs</b> in Texas. This information can be used to evaluate biophysical and socioeconomic options for that management effort in several areas. These are the establishment of legal ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hogs,</b> legal liability, and creation of rules, regulations, and programs which increase the efficiency of management efforts...|$|R
