5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> insisted {{that it should not}} be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with <b>the</b> <b>bishops,</b> and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by <b>the</b> <b>bishops.</b> Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E
5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet was one of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king ordered {{him to leave the}} kingdom, with the support of most of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> and nobility.|$|E
5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, or at least not one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
50|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury has a {{ceremonial}} provincial curia, or court, consisting {{of some of}} <b>the</b> senior <b>bishops</b> of his province. <b>The</b> <b>Bishop</b> of London—the most senior cleric of the church {{with the exception of}} the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial dean, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Winchester as chancellor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Lincoln as vice-chancellor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Salisbury as precentor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Worcester as chaplain and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Rochester as cross-bearer.|$|R

25|$|Just {{before the}} Great Entrance, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> commemorates those whom he wishes, taking out {{particles}} from a special prosphoron {{that has been}} prepared for him. Then each priest, deacon, and server approaches <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> and kissing <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> right shoulder says his own name, by which <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> takes out a particle commemorating him. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> censes <b>the</b> offerings.|$|R

5|$|Wilfrid {{spent his}} exile in Mercia, where {{he enjoyed the}} staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the {{southern}} border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by <b>the</b> <b>bishops.</b> According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> reminded {{him that he had}} promised Wilfrid safe-conduct. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among <b>the</b> <b>bishops.</b> He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the cathedral}} is Roskilde Palace, built from 1733 to 1736 {{on the site}} of the former {{residence}} of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> of Roskilde.

5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> to Reims, and after that appointed three of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Talbot and de Lacy then {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the town of Bath. While scouting, the two men were attacked by forces from the city, and Talbot was captured by forces under the control of <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> of Bath, Robert of Lewes. The Empress' forces then arranged a parley with <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> and offered him a safe conduct, but when <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> showed up at the meeting, he was threatened with hanging unless Talbot was released. <b>The</b> <b>bishop</b> released Talbot under duress. The release affected <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> relations with Stephen, who accused <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> of supporting Matilda, and was only with difficulty persuaded to accept <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> explanation.|$|R

5|$|On 2 July, Pope John Paul II {{condemned}} the consecration in his apostolic letter Ecclesia Dei, {{in which he}} stated that the consecration constituted a schismatic act and that by virtue of Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law, <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> and priests involved were automatically excommunicated.|$|E

5|$|The Quebra Quilo riots were {{suspected}} of being condoned by priests, and together with the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>bishops,</b> {{drew attention to the}} Imperial government having become embroiled in a no-win dispute. The crisis would only be smoothed over by the replacement of the Cabinet in September 1875 and the Emperor's reluctant grant of a full amnesty to <b>the</b> <b>bishops.</b> Historian Heitor Lyra blamed Rio Branco and his Cabinet, both bishops and, primarily, PedroII for the ordeal. All parties involved revealed a lack of tact, and their intransigence only caused harm—mostly to the monarchy itself. The main consequence of the crisis was that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in upholding PedroII. Although they abandoned the Emperor, most eagerly awaited the accession of his eldest daughter and heir Isabel because of her Ultramontane views.|$|E
5|$|The {{archbishop}} {{swore to}} Henry I {{that he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135. He was persuaded {{to do so by}} Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> of Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces}} of Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) {{were two of the}} new {{generation}} of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E

5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> {{has been seen as}} a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two Argentine bishops at the Holy See held a {{mass for}} Alfonsín as well.
