5|$|Rider Haggard was {{interested}} in land affairs and wrote several works on the subject; in 1895 he served on a government commission to examine Salvation Army labour colonies, and in 1911 he served on the Royal Commission examining coastal erosion.

5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm wrote a letter <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times,</b> printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm {{was able to make}} a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city.

During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on June 13, 1971, The New York Times began {{printing}} {{large portions}} of the Pentagon Papers. The papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the Vietnam War, of which former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public. Ellsberg had {{for a year and}} a half approached members of Congress – such as William Fulbright, George McGovern, Charles Mathias, and Pete McCloskey – about publishing the documents, on the grounds that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution, but all had refused. Instead, Ellsberg gave the documents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b>|$|E
5|$|Music in Belarus largely {{comprises}} a rich {{tradition of}} folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions {{can be traced}} back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 19th century, Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich and created the opera Sialanka (Peasant Woman). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet Nightingale by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.|$|E

5|$|On Independence Day and Republic Day, {{patriotic}} {{songs in}} regional languages are broadcast {{on television and}} radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. Patriotic films are broadcast. Over the decades, according <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> of India, {{the number of such}} films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films. The population cohort that belong to the Generation Next often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and designer garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Retail stores offer Independence Day sales promotions. Some news reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August.|$|E

5|$|Shaw was a {{prolific}} correspondent throughout his life. His letters, edited by Dan H. Laurence, were published between 1965 and 1988. Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes; Laurence commented that, unedited, they would fill many more. Shaw wrote {{more than a}} quarter of a million letters, of which about ten per cent have survived; 2,653 letters are printed in Laurence's four volumes. Among Shaw's many regular correspondents were his childhood friend Edward McNulty; his theatrical colleagues (and amitiés amoureuses) Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry; writers including Lord Alfred Douglas, H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton; the boxer Gene Tunney; the nun Laurentia McLachlan; and the art expert Sydney Cockerell. In 2007 a 316-page volume consisting entirely of Shaw's letters <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> was published.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited {{many of those}} who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk's {{connection}} with John of Gaunt was strong, a family connection that went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> of Suffolk's father. Suffolk's second wife Isabel {{had a daughter}} from a previous marriage, who was in Gaunt's wardship. This daughter, Elizabeth, who was an heiress of Lord Strange, was probably transferred to Isabel's household at her marriage to Suffolk. The two lords also maintained {{some of the same}} men as servants, or retainers. At the Good Parliament in 1376, Suffolk was elected to a committee that would discuss the parliament's grievances concerning the failed fiscal and military policies of Gaunt, who was the de facto ruler of England. In spite of his association with Gaunt, the parliament trusted Suffolk's neutrality and equality in such a position. After parliament disbanded, Suffolk attended a lavish dinner given by the House of Commons, where Gaunt was conspicuously absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

Lang was sympathetic to the Sword of the Spirit campaign, founded by Cardinal Hinsley in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 Lambeth Palace, Lang's London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.|$|E
