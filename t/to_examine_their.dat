5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view}} to expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{prompted}} by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning {{a series of events}} known as the English Reformation. In the same year there was a Visitation of the Monasteries, ostensibly <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> character, but in fact to value their assets with a view to expropriation. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, however, was an entirely candid valuation of the income of the monasteries. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, allied to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Shrewsbury Abbey's income was assessed by the Valor at precisely £527 15s. 5¾d. Of this, £414 1s. 3¼d. was contributed by the temporalities; essentially, property rents drawn from estates in 26 manors of Shropshire and seven in other counties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} the values of the most {{meaningful}} parameters on the behavior of MAX–MIN Ant System is analyzed.

We propose an analytic approach <b>to</b> <b>examining</b> <b>their</b> impact on the speed of convergence of the algorithm. Some computational experiments are reported to show the practical relevance of the theoretical results. Keywords: parameters, MAX–MIN Ant System. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} miniaturized, {{broadband}} communication systems {{has created a}} need for electrically small, broadband antennas. However, all passive electrically small antennas have a fundamental gain-bandwidth limitation related to their electrical size, as first described by Wheeler and Chu. This limitation can be overcome using active non-Foster circuits (negative inductors and/or negative capacitors), which can deliver a broadband input match with active matching techniques, or can help reduce phase dispersion using negative delay effects. This thesis will illustrate the advantages of non-Foster circuits in obtaining broadband small antennas, in addition <b>to</b> <b>examining</b> <b>their</b> practical limitations due to noise in receive applications, and nonlinearity in transmit applications...|$|R

500|$|The Doctor takes Clara in the TARDIS <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> {{specific}} {{location at}} various points during Earth's history and repeatedly takes photographs of the same area.

[...] From his pictures the Doctor comes {{to the conclusion that}} the [...] "ghost" [...] is actually a pioneer time traveler named Hila Tacorian. Hila was trapped in a pocket dimension where time moves more slowly; for every second she is trapped in the pocket dimension one hundred thousand years pass in the normal world. The Doctor realizes that he cannot use the TARDIS to rescue her because the entropy of the pocket dimension would drain the TARDIS of its energy within seconds. Instead, the Doctor prepares a device which includes a blue crystal from Metebelis III to stimulate Emma's psychic abilities to open a gateway to this pocket dimension. Once opened, the Doctor will travel across and rescue Hila with a harness anchored in the normal world.|$|E
