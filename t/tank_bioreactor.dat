40|$|Biomass {{accumulation}} and tropane alkaloids {{production by}} diploid and tetraploid hairy root cultures of Datura stramonium L. cultivated in stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactor</b> at different aeration rates were investigated. The maximal growth for both hairy root cultures (ADB = 8. 3 g/L and 6. 8 g/L for diploid and tetraploid line, respectively) was achieved at aeration rate of 15. 0 L/(L. h). The corresponding growth indexes were remarkably high (GIDW = 9. 0 and 7. 8 for diploid and tetraploid line, respectively) {{compared to the}} values, usually reported for other hairy root cultures. The optimal aeration rate for biomass accumulation was also optimal for alkaloids biosynthesis. According to our survey, the achieved maximal amounts of accumulated hyoscyamine (35. 0 mg/L and 27. 0 mg/L for diploid and tetraploid line) were the highest reported in the scientific literature for D. stramonium L. hairy roots. During the cultivation in stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactor,</b> the hairy roots biosynthesized pharmaceutically important alkaloid scopolamine in minor concentrations. This is an important observation since scopolamine was not detected during submerged cultivation of these hairy root lines in other bioreactor types. However, the ploidy level {{was found to be}} the most important factor concerning scopolamine production by D. stramonium L. hairy roots cultures. The present work demonstrated the effect of ploidity levels on biomass accumulation and tropane alkaloids production by D. stramonium L. hairy roots cultivated in stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactor.</b> This investigation show that the stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactor</b> could be successfully applied for both maximal biomass accumulations, as well as for manipulation of tropane alkaloids production by diploid and tetraploid D. stramonium L. hairy root cultures...|$|E

The addition of anion-exchange resins reduced acetate accumulation in the culture, which in turn, improved growth of E. coli and enhanced PrIFN-alpha 2 b expression. The presence of anion-exchange resins did not influence the physiology of the cells. The weak base anion-exchange resins, which have higher affinity towards acetate, yielded higher PrIFN-alpha 2 b expression as compared to strong anion-exchange resins. High concentrations of anion-exchange resin showed inhibitory effect towards growth of E. coli as well as the expression of PrIFN-alpha 2 b. The maximum yield of PrIFN-alpha 2 b in shake flask culture (501. 8 mu g/L) and stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (578. 8 mu g/L) was obtained at ion exchange resin (WA 30) concentration of 12. 2 g/L.

40|$|Background Conventional {{experiments}} in small scale are often {{performed in a}} Black Box fashion, analyzing only the product concentration in the final sample. Online monitoring of relevant process characteristics and parameters such as substrate limitation, product inhibition and oxygen supply is lacking. Therefore, fully equipped laboratory-scale stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactors</b> are hitherto required for detailed studies of new microbial systems. However, they are too spacious, laborious and expensive to be operated in larger number in parallel. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to present a new experimental approach to obtain dense quantitative process information by parallel use of two small-scale culture systems with online monitoring capabilities: Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS) and the BioLector device. Results The same mastermix (medium plus microorganisms) was distributed to the different small-scale culture systems: 1) RAMOS device; 2) 48 -well microtiter plate for BioLector device; and 3) separate shake flasks or microtiter plates for offline sampling. By adjusting the same maximum oxygen transfer capacity (OTRmax), the results from the RAMOS and BioLector online monitoring systems supplemented each other very well for all studied microbial systems (E. coli, G. oxydans, K. lactis) and culture conditions (oxygen limitation, diauxic growth, auto-induction, buffer effects).

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} {{identifiability}} and observability of anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. In {{such kind of}} processes, generally carried out in continuously stirred <b>tank</b> <b>bioreactors,</b> the organic matter is depolluted by microorganisms into biogas and compost {{in the absence of}} oxygen. The biogas is an additional energy source, which can replace fossil fuel sources. The differential algebraic approach of general observation problems has been applied to investigate the identification and observation of a simple AD model. The major discovery is that the biomass specific growth rate can be stably estimated from easily measured quantities: the dilution rate and the biogas flow rate. Next if the yield coefficients are assumed known then, of course, the biomass concentration is observable. Unfortunately, even under the latter strongest assumption the substrate concentration is not observable. This concentration becomes observable if an additional model, say the Monod model, is assumed for the specific growth rate. Illustrative simulations are presented...|$|R
