40|$|The {{presence}} of minority students’ nowadays {{is a reality}} at higher education institutions with Latvian instruction language and the teaching staff has <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a multicultural environment using appropriate study methods, means, forms. Icelandic sociologist Petursdottir (2009) considers students’ cooperation skills development to be promoted by such study methods, forms and means which allow students to be active, further students’ cooperation and help students ascertain the cultural diversity as an advantage. As the most appropriate study method Petursdottir mentions a cooperative learning, because {{the goal of this}} method is not only to improve the acquirement of the study course, but also develop students’ social learning. One of the ways of cooperative learning is a study excursion which may promote students’ integration skills development in different directions: 1) by popularization diversity in the content of a study excursion, 2) by helping students get introduced with a different cultural environment, 3) by favouring cooperation and communication among students of different cultural background in the informal atmosphere of a study excursion...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for filtering graphical link training data by using anomaly detection {{for the purpose}} of link prediction in PPI networks. The performance of the resulting predictor compares favourably with the classifier trained on unfiltered data. The central idea is to have a filtering step before the classification step where suspicious links are removed from the training data. One issue that needs emphasis here is that the choice of anomaly detection technique plays a critical role in the success of the resulting classifier. If the anomaly detector is inaccurate, then the classifier may not yield optimum performance. One way to ascertain the efficacy of the anomaly detection is by deliberately mislabeling the positive links and checking if the anomaly detection algorithm can detect them, which is how we have selected our Gaussian Process algorithm. Additionally, this technique shows most improvement in performance when the link prediction accuracy is not particularly high before filtering, as this allows for greater room for classification improvement. Additionally, this technique needs to be extended to link prediction in networks with directed edges (metabolic networks), weighted edges (neural networks). While the given technique is useful for detecting missing links more efficiently, it may have <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for evolving networks where the links are constantly changing. These ideas are the focus of our future work.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{reconfiguration}} is {{a relatively}} new feature of FPGAs and it allows the modification of hardware functionalities at runtime, providing the possibility for great improvements in the concept of reconfigurable computing. However, this new approach also creates some problems in the implementation phase of modules and in their placement. By restricting the form of single functions to arrays of whole columns communicating on a single horizontal bus, the problem can be significantly simplified. Column-wise partial reconfiguration can be realized by means of a space allocation manager that determines the columns where single modules should be placed and a component which modifies the bitstream to place it in the correct position.
