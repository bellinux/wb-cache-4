5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Legree {{begins to}} hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and {{resolves}} to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves {{as best he}} can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{reacted to}} the growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E
5|$|A rough collie named Lad {{lives at}} the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins {{ignoring}} Lad {{in favor of the}} newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
50|$|A slave insurrection in 1822 {{resulted}} in two dead and seven injured. The government condemned 19 slaves to death, 10 to the galleys, six <b>to</b> <b>whipping,</b> and eight <b>to</b> {{helping with the}} executions.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

50|$|The sailmaker's {{whipping}} is the yardstick for comparison. It is {{more durable}} because the turns are wrapped with frapping turns which are threaded through the rope. One approach <b>to</b> <b>whipping</b> {{the ends of}} a rope with this method requires a needle. Another relies on raveling the strands <b>to</b> start the <b>whipping</b> and twisting them back before beginning the wraps. Compared to the West Country whipping, both of these approaches are harder to understand and remember.|$|R

In this talk he urged {{industry}} to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> up support. Despite the reported skepticism of Bill Gates and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's use {{of yellow}} journalism {{techniques}} in his New York Journal <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> up {{popular support for}} U.S. military adventurism in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 was also criticized in Upton Sinclair's 1919 book, The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism. According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspapers distorted world events and deliberately tried to discredit Socialists. Another critic, Ferdinand Lundberg, extended the criticism in Imperial Hearst (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad to slant the news. After the war, a further critic, George Seldes, repeated the charges in Facts and Fascism (1947).|$|E

The company also sold Comprint Military Publications and its Southern Maryland Newspapers group (which consisted of the Maryland Independent, The Enterprise, the Calvert Recorder, and the Enquirer Gazette, and their associated Southern Maryland Newspaper Web site) to Adams Publishing Group.

25|$|William Wells Brown, {{who escaped}} to freedom, {{reported}} that on one plantation, slave men {{were required to}} pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed {{in his or her}} quota, they were subject <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales. A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping. By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.|$|E
25|$|A Scottish settler named Dr Andrew Turnbull transplanted around 1,500 indentured settlers, from Menorca, Majorca, Ibiza, Smyrna, Crete, Mani Peninsula, and Sicily, to grow hemp, sugarcane, indigo, and {{to produce}} rum. Settled at New Smyrna, within months the colony {{suffered}} major losses {{primarily due to}} insect-borne diseases and Native American raids. Most crops did not {{do well in the}} sandy Florida soil. Those that survived rarely equaled the quality produced in other colonies. The colonists tired of their servitude and Turnbull's rule. On several occasions, he used African slaves <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> his unruly settlers. The settlement collapsed and the survivors fled to safety with the British authorities in St. Augustine. Their descendants survive to this day, as does the name New Smyrna.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) defended the titles against Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). Midnight Express's manager Jim Cornette was locked and {{suspended}} high in a steel cage and fastened in a straight jacket. The match stipulated that if Fantastics won, they would get the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> Cornette ten times with a belt. Cornette tried to involve himself into the match on several occasions but failed. The match {{went back and forth}} with the challengers double teaming Fulton. Rogers was tagged in and he battled Eaton and Lane. Lane handed Eaton a steel chain and Eaton wrapped it around his fist. Fulton was unaware of it which allowed Eaton to attack Fulton with the chain and pin him to win the titles.|$|E
