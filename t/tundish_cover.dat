40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a properties and production of nodular cast iron. The first section describes the classification, distribution and structure of nodular cast iron. The second part is focuses on the description of nodular cast iron, modification, inoculation and production. A strong effort is made on the production of nodular cast iron using the <b>Tundish</b> <b>Cover</b> method and the Initek process. In conclusion, {{the structure of the}} material is evaluated on samples that were delivered for metallographic analysis. The final evaluation {{of the structure of the}} material is used to compare the mechanical properties of a nodular cast iron produced by <b>Tundish</b> <b>Cover</b> method and Initek process...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the production and technology of ductile cast iron castings in China is reviewed. The manufacture and process control of as-cast ductile iron are discussed. The microstructure, properties and application of partial austenitization normalizing ductile iron and austempered ductile iron (ADI) are briefl y depicted. The new development of ductile iron production techniques, such as cored-wire injection (wire-feeding nodularization) process, <b>tundish</b> <b>cover</b> ladle nodularizing process, horizontal continuous casting, and EPC process (lost foam) for ductile iron castings, etc., are summarized...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a new concept}} of the cover for {{installation}} for continuous casting of steel have been studied and discussed. The main essence in the most favourable construction includes the existing stresses and strains developed in service conditions. Instead of former cover, made with heat-resistant concrete and flat plate, the new solution introduced two factors: increased rigidity whole cover and new thermal insulation material. It is a composite refractory material, more light, plastic and more resistant for thermal shocks. In the final results, the new <b>tundish</b> <b>cover</b> confirmed in practice prolongation of the cover exploitation from 15 - 25 000 tones to above 90 000 tones poured steel...|$|E
40|$|Thickness of <b>tundish</b> <b>cover</b> flux (TCF) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in continuous casting (CC) steelmaking process. Traditional measurement method of TCF thickness is single/double wire methods, which have several problems such as personal security, easily affected by operators, and poor repeatability. To solve all these problems, in this paper, we specifically designed and built an instrumentation and presented a novel method to measure the TCF thickness. The instrumentation was composed of a measurement bar, a mechanical device, a high-definition industrial camera, a Siemens S 7 - 200 programmable logic controller (PLC), and a computer. Our measurement method was based on the computer vision algorithms, including image denoising method, monocular range measurement method, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and image gray gradient detection method. Using the present instrumentation and method, images in the CC tundish can be collected by camera and transferred to computer to do imaging processing. Experiments showed that our instrumentation and method worked well at scene of steel plants, can accurately measure the thickness of TCF, and overcome the disadvantages of traditional measurement methods, or even replace the traditional ones...|$|E
