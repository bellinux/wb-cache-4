40|$|A pyrolysis-gas Chromatographic (py-g. c.) {{method for}} {{estimation}} of the Sorg/C ratio in kerogens {{and other forms of}} sedimentary macromolecular organic matter is described. The method is based upon flash pyrolysis at 610 °C for 10 s and areal integration of the FID peaks attributed to 2, 3 -dimethylthiophen, 1, 2 -dimethylbenzene and n-non- 1 -ene. Comparison of the ratio [2, 3 -dimethylthiophen]/[n-non- 1 -ene + 1, 2 -dimethylbenzene], denoted TR, with chemically determined atomic Sorg/C ratio revealed a distinct correlation (r 2 = 0. 89), suggesting that TR appears to broadly reflect the latter ratio for a variety of geological materials. Py-g. c. of untreated, whole rock samples indicated that whilst the atomic Stot/C ratio determined by elemental analysis was strongly influenced by the presence of inorganic sulphur, TR showed no such dependence. The independence of TR from matrix effects demonstrates that this method has an advantage in that samples may be directly analysed for organic sulphur content with little or no preparation. A trivariate plot was used to depict the relative abundances of each of the three individual components used to derive TR. On the basis of their position within this plot, samples derived from marine and hypersaline sedimentary environments could be clearly distinguished from those of freshwater lacustrine or predominantly higher plant origin. Maturity was also shown to significantly influence the relative abundance of <b>thiophens,</b> most notably in those sequences which contained kerogens with high initial organic sulphur contents. In these samples a preferential loss of 2, 3 -dimethylthiophen relative to alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons was observed with increasing maturation. Quantitative pyrolysis data showed that the absolute amounts of <b>thiophens</b> generated from sulphur-rich kerogens is high {{and that there is a}} marked depletion in yields with increasing maturity. It is believed that the extension of py-g. c. to the characterization of macromolecularly bound organic sulphur will prove useful in fossil fuel research as a supplementary source of information on organically bound sulphur...|$|R

'l'he dielectric data of the systems studied is {{discussed in terms of}} the relaxation processes contributing to the dielectric absorption and the apparent dipole moments. Pyridine, <b>thiophen</b> and furan in solution have a distribution of relaxation times which may be attributed to the small size of the solute molecules relative to the solvent. Larger rigid molecules in solution were characterized by a single relaxation time as would be anticipated from theory. The dielectric data of toluene, ethyl-, isopropyl- and t-butylbenzene as pure liquids and in solution were described by two relaxation times, one identified with molecular re-orientation and a shorter relaxation time. · The subsequent work was investigation of the possible explanations of this short relaxation process. Comparable short relaxation times were obtained from the analysis of the dielectric data of solutions of p-chloro- and p-bromotoluene below 40 °C, o- and m-xylene at 25 °C and 1 -methyl- and 2 methylnaphthalene at 50 C. Rigid molecules of similar shapes and sizes were characterized by a single relaxation time identified with molecular re-orientation. Contributions from a long relaxation process attributed to dipolar origins were reported for solutions of nitrobenzene, benzonitrile and p-nitrotoluene. A short relaxation process of possible dipolar origins contributed to the dielectric absorption of 4 -methyl- and 4 -t-butylpyridine in cyclohexane at 25 °C. It was concluded that the most plausible explanation of the short relaxation process of the alkyl-aryl hydrocarbons studied appears to be intramolecular relaxation about the alkyl-aryl bond.

A number of mono-tritiated substituted benzenes, heterocyclic, and polynuclear compounds have been prepared and rates of detritiation have been measured, mainly in anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid.

Conclusions are considered in relation to data available for the more familiar aromatic substitutions, such as bromination and nitration, and some anomalies are noted.

Measurement of the rate of detritiation of o- and p-tritiated -toluene and -t-butylbenzene in a variety of media has shown that variations in the relative reactivities of ortho- and para- positions cannot be ascribed to steric effects. The rates of detritiation of the compounds, 4 -X-[4 '- 3 H] biphenyl (where x = 4 -Me > 4 -Meo > 4 -C 1 4 -Br > 4 -NO 2) and 2 -x-[7 - 3 H] fluorine (where X = Me > Meo > H C 1 > Br > CO 2 H > NO 2) have been measured.

40|$|Das Polyamin "pyN 4 " bildet mit vielen Übergangsmetallen einkernige Komplexe, in denen der tetrapodal fünfzähnige Chelator eine quadratisch-pyramidale Koordinationskappe ausbildet. Vor dem Hintergrund der Generierung einer aktiven Ligandperipherie, konnte in einer templatgestützten Synthese die selektive Derivatisierung der primären Aminofunktionen des Liganden erreicht werden. Am komplexgebundenen pyN 4 -Liganden können durch Reaktion mit Aceton zwei Isopropylidenimingruppen an zwei der vier primären Aminofunktionen eingeführt werden. Gegenstand der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Untersuchung des stereochemischen Verlaufs der Reduktion dieses an einem Kupfer(II) - und Nickel(II) -Ion komplexgebundenen Azomethinliganden. Die vier primären Aminfunktionen des pentadentaten Chelatliganden pyN 4 konnten in der Weise alkyliert werden, dass die Derivate der allgemeinen Form pyN 4 (R) 4 (R = Me, i-Propyl, Trimethylsilyl) erhalten wurden. Eine zu dieser Alkylierung analoge Arylierung der vier primären Aminfunktionen im Tetraaminimin pyN 4 lies sich mit Hilfe einer Kupfer(I) -katalysierten Reaktion nach Buchwald-Hartwig erreichen. So konnten auch substituierte Aryle eingeführt werden. In einer nukleophilen aromatischen Substitution unter Zuhilfenahme geeigneter Basen konnten zudem Derivate mit perfluorierten Arylen erhalten werden. All diese Derivate enthalten durchweg sekundäre Aminfunktionen und folglich nur mehr vier N-H-Protonen. Im Falle des Phenyl subsituierten Derivates konnten die sekundären Aminprotonen deprotoniert werden und so der entsprechende potentielle Tetraamidligand erhalten werden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde neben dem pyN 4 -Liganden (N 5 -Donorsatz) auch die retrosynthetische und präparative Ausarbeitung eines neuen Ligandsystems mit SN 4 -Donorsatz vorgestellt, dessen Aufbau in mehreren Schritten aus einfachen Vorläufersubstanzen möglich war.

Schließlich waren Synthesekonzepte zur Darstellung neuer pentadentater Chelatliganden auf der Basis von Pyridin Gegenstand der vorliegenden Forschungsarbeit. Diese beinhalteten eine asymmetrische sukzessive Substitution in 2 - und 6 -Position des Pyridinringes.

The Polyamine "pyN 4 " forms {{mononuclear}} complexes {{with various}} transition metals, {{in which this}} tetrapodal pentadentate ligand forms a square-pyramidal coordination cap. With regard to the generation of an active ligand periphery, a selective derivatisation of the primary amino groups of the ligand could be achieved in a template supported synthesis. With acetone isopropylideneimine functions {{to two of the}} four primary amino groups at the complex bonded pyN 4 -ligand can be introduced. Investigations of the stereochemical pathway of the reduction of this to a copper(II) - and nickel(II) complex bonded azomethine ligand was one focus of this work. The four primary amino groups of the pentadentate ligand pyN 4 could be alkylated in a manner that the derivatives of the general formula pyN 4 (R) 4 (R = Me, i-Propyl, Trimethylsilyl) were received. An analogous arylation of the four primary amino groups of the tetraamine pyN 4 could be achieved with a copper(I) -catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig reaction. By this way also substituted aryls could be introduced. Furthermore in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution with suited bases derivatives with perfluorinated aryls were received. All this derivatives now have only secondary amino groups and therefore only four N-H-protons. In the case of the phenyl substituted compounds all of the secondary amino protons could be deprotonated resulting in the corresponding potential tetraamido ligand. Next to the pyN 4 -ligands (N 5 donor set) retrosynthetic aspects and the preparation of a new ligand system with a SN 4 donor set is shown in this work. The mounting of this ligand system was done in several steps with simple precursors. Complexation of these <b>thiophen</b> based ligand with RuCl 2 (PPh 3) 3 resulted in a neutral binuclear complex in which the ligand as a central unit bounds two ruthenium(II) centers. Finally the synthetic concepts for producing new pyridine based pentadentate chelating ligands was subject of this work. These include an asymmetric gradually substitution in position 2 and 6 of the pyridine ring. Thereby the fist precursors of such "hybrid" ligands were obtained in several steps by the use of simple precursor compounds...|$|E

Whereas in nickel apparatus, the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) was the main product in both reactions. Chapter 7 discusses the mechanism of the isomerisation reactions of the polyfluoroaryl prop- 2 -ynyl ethers and thioethers studied in this thesis. It also incorporates a critical experiment in which compound (161) is reacted with N, N-diethylaniline at 140 C only to be recovered unchanged. (The thermolysis of (161) in p-xylene at the, same temperature gives the substitution product (159) exclusively) The charge-separated species (197) and (195) are proposed as intermediates in the reactions of the ether (156) and thioether (171) via the heterolytic fission of the sp (^ 3) C-F bond in the Claisen rearrangement intermediates (157) and (172) respectively. It is concluded that the isomerisation reactions of (I 56) and (171), which require a 1, 4 -fluorine shift, proceed via an ionic mechanism. The final chapter describes the thermolysis reactions of the naphthyl ether (156) and the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene and 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene. Compounds (156) and (161) react with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene at 150 C to give 2 -(2, 2, 3 -trimethylbut- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (186) and a small amount of 2 -(2, 3, 3 -trlmethylbut-l. enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho(2, 1 -b) furan (187) compound (161) reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene at 25 C in the presence of BF(_ 3) -etherate to give the Markovnikov addition-elimination product, 2 -(3, 4 -dimethylpent- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (194) and a small amount of (186). Thermolysis of both (156) and (161) with 3, 3 -dimethylbut- 1 ene gave (186) as the major product accompanied by smaller amounts of (187) and (194). It is proposed that compounds (186) and (187) arise via reaction with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene formed by isomerisation of the terminal alkene. 2 -Chloromethyl - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2,l-b) furan (161 a) has been prepared; it reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene in the presence of ZnCl (_ 2), to give (186), (194) and (196) ...|$|E

Die Zugabe von Trifluoroessigsäure (TFA) (10 Vol-%) zu Bortrifluorid-Diethylether + Ethylether (Verhältnis 1 : 2) erniedrigte das Oxidationspotenzial der Monomere; die Polymerisationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhte sich, da TFA die Ionenleitfähigkeit des Elektrolyts vergrößert. Die Homopolymere zeigen nur einen Redoxpeak, verursacht durch Polymeroxidation und - reduktion. Die elektrochemische Copolymerisation wird bei verschiedenen Potenzialen und mit unterschiedlichen Thiophen- oder 3 -Chlorothiophenkonzentrationen untersucht. Die Copolymere zeigen ein Redoxpeakpaar, dessen Position sich wesentlich von der der Homopolymere unterscheidet. Mit zunehmendem Polymerisationspotenzial und/oder zunehmender Konzentration an Thiophen- oder 3 -Chlorothiophen werden auch mehr Thiophen- oder 3 -Chlorothiopheneinheiten in den Copolymerfilm eingebaut. Ein Elektropolymerisationmechanismus wird für die Copolymere vermutet und die Copolymere weisen eine recht gute Langzeitstabilität der Redoxaktivität nach Zyklen in Acetonitril auf. In situ UV-Vis-Spektren der Homo- und Copolymerfilme wurden gemessen und λ 1 max, welches dem π → π*- Übergang entspricht, wurde bestimmt. Der optische Übergang bei λ 2 max vom Valenzband in das höhere Bipolaronband wurde ebenfalls bestimmt. Die Bandlücke für die Homo- und Copolymerfilme beim direkten Übergang wurde von der Kante im Absorptionsspektrum abgeschätzt. Die elektrochemische Thermodynamik für die Homo- und Copolymerfilme deutet darauf hin, dass jeweils ein Elektron von den Polymersegmenten, bestehend aus 4 Monomereinheiten, entfernt wird. Die untersuchten leitfähigen Filme zeigen einen Leitfähigkeitssprung mit einer stabilen Leitfähigkeit bis EAg/AgCl= 2 V. Diese Leitfähigkeitsänderung ist reversibel. Polyfuran hat verglichen mit Polythiophen eine geringere Leitfähigkeit und die Leitfähigkeit von Poly(3 -chlorothiophen) ist rund eine Zehnerpotenz niedriger als die von Polythiophen. Da das in situ Leitfähigkeitsverhalten der Copolymere nicht die Summe der einzelnen Homopolymere bildet, kann man ausschließen, dass es sich bei den abgeschiedenen Copolymeren um Blockcopolymere handelt. Mit Hilfe der FTIR-Spektroskopie wurden Schwingungsspektren der Homo- und Copolymerfilme aufgenommen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es zur α-α'-Verknüpfung zwischen den Radikalkationen während der Copolymerisation kommt, was charakteristisch ist für α-substituierte fünfgliedrige heterozyklische Verbindungen. Der Mechanismus der elektrochemischen Degradation von Furan-Thiophen-Copolymeren wird ebenfalls mit Hilfe der gemessenen Spektren beschrieben. Die in situ Resonanz-Raman-Spektroskopie ergab, dass die spektroskopischen Eigenschaften der Copolymere zwischen denen der Homopolymere lagen. Bei höheren Polymerisationspotenzialen und höheren Konzentrationen an <b>Thiophen</b> oder 3 -Chlorothiophen werden mehr Thiophen- oder 3 - Chlorothiopheneinheiten in die Copolymerketten eingebaut. Es ist offensichtlich, dass die Ramanspektren der Copolymere wesentlich komplexer sind als die der Homopolymere, wodurch die Auswertung erschwert wird. Dennoch erinnern die Ramanspektren der Copolymere an die der Homopolymere. Die spektroelektrochemischen Eigenschaften der Copolymere haben bestätigt, dass deren Charakteristika zwischen denen der Homopolymere liegen, was deutlich macht, dass die Oxidation von Monomeren möglich ist und dass die Copolymerketten demnach aus Furan- und Thiophen- bzw. 3 - Chlorothiopheneinheiten bestehen können. Electrochemical {{copolymerization}} of furan and thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene {{was successfully}} realized in a solvent system consisting of boron trifluoride ethyl ether (BFEE) + ethyl ether (EE) (ratio 1 : 2) at constant electrode potential. The addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (10 % by volume) to BFEE + EE (ratio 1 : 2) decreased the oxidation {{potential of the}} monomers; the polymerization rate was also accelerated because TFA increases the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. The homopolymers have only one redox peak caused by polymer oxidation and reduction. Electrochemical copolymerization both at different potentials and with different thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene concentrations is investigated. The copolymers show one anodic/cathodic peak couple that appears at a position {{quite different from the}} positions observed with homopolymers. More thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene units are incorporated into the copolymer film with an increasing polymerization potential of the copolymer and/or with an increasing concentration of thiophene or 3 - chlorothiophene in the feed. An electropolymerization mechanism of copolymers has been proposed, and the copolymers show a fairly good long-term stability of the redox activity after cycling in acetonitrile. In situ UV-Vis spectra of the homo- and copolymer films were measured and λ 1 max which corresponds to the π → π* transition is determined. The optical transition with λ 2 max from the valence band into the higher bipolaron band is also assigned. The band gap (Eg) for homo- and copolymer films from a direct interband transition is estimated from the absorption edge of the spectrum. The redox thermodynamics of the homo- and copolymer films suggest that one electron is removed from polymer segments containing four monomer units. The studied conducting films show a single conductivity change with a stable conductivity up to EAg/AgCl= 2 V. The conductivity of these films is almost restored when the potential shift direction is reversed. Polyfuran compared to polythiophene, has a lower conductivity and the conductivity of poly(3 -chlorothiophene) is around one order of magnitude lower than that of polythiophene. The in situ conductivity properties of the copolymers are not the sum of those of the individual homopolymers. This result may eliminate the possibility that the copolymers can be considered as block copolymers. Vibrational spectra of homo- and copolymer films investigated in this study have been obtained using FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicate that α-α' coupling of radical cations has taken place in the copolymerization. This is a characteristic of α-substituted five-membered heterocyclic compounds. The electrochemical degradation mechanism of furan-thiophene copolymers is also described using the obtained spectra. The in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy of the copolymers shows spectroscopic properties intermediate between those of homopolymers. At higher polymerization potentials and at higher concentrations of thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene in the feed more thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene units are incorporated into the copolymer chains. It is obvious that the Raman spectra of the copolymers are more complex than those of homopolymers, which makes the assignment difficult. However, the in situ Raman spectra of the copolymers are reminiscent of those of the homopolymers. The spectroelectrochemical properties of the copolymers confirmed that the copolymers show intermediate characteristics between the homopolymers, implying that oxidation of monomers is possible and the copolymer chains may accordingly be composed of furan and thiophene or 3 -chlorothiophene units...|$|E

O tratamento com TAA modula o processo inflamat??rio in vivo, auxiliando na sua resolu????oTuberculosis is a contagious infectious disease that compromises mainly the upper airways. This affects specially humans and also other animals. It {{is caused by}} mycobacterias from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex. Nowadays approximately 1. 7 billion people {{in the whole world}} are infected. Around 20 million are suffering with active tuberculosis. Data from WHO estimate that in 2008, 9. 4 million new tuberculosis cases occurred all over the world. Tuberculosis treatment basically happens with drugs developed in the 60 ???s which has not been shown effective in treatment of resistant tuberculosis or in HIV co-infection. Considering these facts, is increasing the search in developing drugs able to act effectively and with low toxicity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the bactericidal action of <b>thiophen</b> derivative, thiopheacetamide (TAA), over Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), and its action in vivo in the experimental model of pleurisy induced by M. bovis (BCG), in mice. The test of Alamar Blue indicated that TAA present bacteriostatic action over M. bovis (BCG). The indirect bactericidal capacity over M. bovis (BCG) infected macrophages was evaluated through the counting of the colony-forming unit (CFU), and TAA treatment was efficient in decreasing those. We also analyzed whether TAA would have an immunomodulating action over the infected macrophage. We observed that the pre-treatment with TAA of infected macrophage promote a decrease in IL- 12, TNF-?? and nitric oxide (NO) levels, and inhibition of NF-??B translocation, indication a possible anti-inflammatory action. The pos-treated and infected macrophage presented an increase in NO, and keeps partial inhibition of TNF-??, INF-??, e IL- 6. We used the in vivo model of induced pleurisy through M. bovis (BCG) in mice, which were pre-treated with the doses of 5; 25 or 50 mg/kg. It is observed that TAA was capable of modeling the migration of neutrophil in 24 hours and in 15 days and also the mononuclear cells in 24 hours. We noted that TAA presents bactericidal action, decreasing the CFU number at the pleural cavity, discrete in 6 hours, but intense in 24 hours, such as in 15 days, at all tested doses. The evaluating of TAA action over the release of NO, show us that in 6 hours there was a decrease on the release of this mediator on the other hand NO increased significantly in 24 hours but decreased again in 15 days. The analysis of TAA action over the released of cytokines, demonstrated that there was a diminution of IL- 1 ?? and IFN-?? beginning at 6 and 24 hours after infection, respectively, and a inhibition of IL- 6 production only 6 hours post infection. We noted an increased on the release of IL- 12 in all evaluated times and of IL- 6, in 24 hours and in 15 days after the M. bovis (BCG) infection. Our data indicate that this new compound, tiophenacetamide, presents in vitro and in vivo, an important antimicobacterial activity over M. bovis (BCG) and an immunomodulatory effect when used as a pretreatmen...|$|E
40|$|The lipids {{of human}} {{tubercle}} bacilli on mild alkaline hydrolysis give a methanol-insoluble product, which on prolonged hydrolysis yields three main fractions, the mycolic acids, crude phthiocerol, and the mycoceranic acids 1. In {{the course of}} this work a re-investigation of the first two groups of compounds has been carried out, and synthetic analogues of methyl-branched long-chain acids occurring in tubercle bacilli have been prepared for the purpose of biological testing. The mycolic acids - These acids have been demonstrated to be β-hydroxy acids of high molecular weight with a long alkyl side-chain in α-position. Acids containing oxygen functions in addition to the &beta-hydroxyl group have been isolated from various strains of bacilli and {{a detailed description of the}} work up to 1961 has been given by Asselineau 2. More recently, Malani and Polgar 3 have described a mycolic acid containing a methoxyl group, and by oxidative degradations and vapour phase chromatography of the products were able to assign to it a partial structure (I), where n = 21 and 23, m = about 17, (I) OH    | CH 3.

N [...] and C.) showed the presence of three mycolic esters which were named methyl mycolates -I, -II and -III, in order of increasing polarity. Ester-III was shown to contain a keto-group and was isolated chromatographically as its oxime. The mixture of the other two esters was acetylated, and repeated chromatography of the product gave methyl acetylmycolate -I and -II. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding hydroxy-esters which were shown to contain small amounts of the C- 2 epimers. Removal of this material by chromatography on alumina gave methyl mycolate -I, m. p. 49 - 50 Â°, [α] 20 589 + 3. 7 Â°, and methyl mycolate -II, m. p. 48 - 48. 5 Â°, [α] 20 589 + 0. 1 Â°. During the above chromatography some dehydration occurred giving methyl anhydromycolate -I, m. p. 39 - 41 Â°, and methyl anhydromycolate -II, m. p. 32 - 35 Â°. The material from the purification of methyl mycolate -I which contained its epimer was chromatographed repeatedly to give methyl 2 -epimycolate-I, m. p. 56 - 57 Â°, [α] 20 589 - 0. 6 °. The oxime of methyl mycolate -III appeared on UMC to contain two components (the oxime of the corresponding acetoxy-compound behaved similarly) which were shown to be geometrical isomers in respect of the hydroxyimino grouping. Hydrolysis of the oximes of acetoxy-ester-III, and chromatography on alumina gave methyl acetylmycolate -III, m. p. 43 - 5 - 44 Â°, [α] 20 589 + 6. 2 Â°. This chromatography also resulted in. some anhydromycolate-III, m. p. 52 - 52. 5 °. Methyl mycolate -III, m. p. 52 - 53 °, [α] 20 589 + 5. 0 Â°, was obtained by hydrolysis of methyl acetylmycolate -III; a thioketal derivative of the latter was also prepared. Infra-red spectra showed that cyclopropylmetnylene groups 7 were present in all three esters, and ester-II contained a band due to methoxyl. The n. m. r. spectrum of methyl mycolate -I, showing two bands(6 H and 2 H) for the cyclopropane groups, was very similar to that reported for methyl cis - 9, 10 -methylenehexadecanoate 8 and indicated the presence of two non-adjacent cis - 1, 2 - disubstituted cyclopropane groups and only two terminal methyl groups. The n. m. r. spectrum of methyl mycolate -II showed that the single cis -cyclopropane group present was in a different environment, possibly adjacent to the / CH-OMe grouping; a methyl branch was also detected. In the spectrum of acetoxy-ester-III three cyclopropane protons appeared in one broad band; after formation of the corresponding thioketal a single band (4 H) was observed. This result suggested that the molecule contained a trans - 1, 2 - disubstituted cyclopropane group adjacent to a carbonyl group; the ultra-violet spectrum was in agreement. The grouping - CH(CH 3). CO- was also shown to be present. Low resolution mass spectra of all the above compounds were determined, the anhydro-esters giving the moot informative spectra. The results of these mass spectrometric studies in conjunction with the other evidence pointed to structures (III and IV) for the main components of methyl mycolate -II and methyl mycolate -III.

The mass spectrum of methyl mycolate -I, together with the other data described above, indicated that is essentially the same as methyl α-mycolate (Test) described by Etemadi and Lederer 5. These workers supposed that a series of oxygen containing peaks at m/e 459 to 543 were due to cleavage, adjacent to cyclopropane groups, of an aldehyde fragment formed by pyrolysis in the mass spectrometer and gave the structure (II, n 1 = 17, n 2 = 11, n 3 = 16) for the main component of this ester. however, high resolution studies of methyl mycolate -I showed that the basis for the above assignments was insecure; moreover, recent work 9 has shown that peaks due to cleavage adjacent to cyclopropane groups are not usually observed. The results available suggest that the general structure (II) is correct, with cis -cyclopropane substituents, but they do not give at present a clear indication of the exact location of the cyclopropane groups. High-resolution infra-red spectra of methyl mycolate-I -II and -III and methyl 2 -epimycolate-I showed that the epimer forms an intra-molecular hydrogen bond to a smaller extent; studies of molecular models showed that esters -I, -II and -III consequently have erythro configuration in respect of C- 2 and C- 3. The phthiocerol group - Previous investigations 10 indicated that phthiocerol is a mixture of two homologous β-diols having the structure (V) where n is 22 and 20, (V) OMe OH OH    |    |    | CH 3. CH 2. CH. CH. (CH 2) 4. CH. CH 2. CH. (CH 2) n. CH 3    | CH 3 respectively. In the present studies UMC of crude phthiocerol showed (in order of increasing polarity) the presence of the diols (V) in the following named phtniocerol A, material now designated phthiocerol B and ketonic material presumed to be essentially phthiodiolone 11. The presence of several more-polar constituents was also observed. The mixture of cyclic acetals formed by reaction of crude phthiocerol with acetaldehyde and toluene- p -sulphonic acid showed on UMC the same sequence of polarity, thus indicating that phtaiocerol A and B as well as phthiodiolone contain an analogous diol system. Column chromatography of the acetals on alumina gave a mixture of the acetals of phthiocerol A and B, followed by impure acetal of phthiodiolone and by more polar acetals which latter have not been studied further. The mixture of acetals of phthiocerol A and B was chromatographed repeatedly to give phthiocerol A ethylidene acetal, m. p. 40 Â°, and phthiocerol B ethylidene acetal m. p. 35. 5 °. Decomposition of the acetals gave the corresponding diols, phthiocerol A, m. p. 73 - 73. 5 Â°, [α] 20 589 - 4. 5 Â° and phthiocerol B, m. p. 71 - 71. 5 Â°, [α] 20 589 - 8. 2 Â°. The infra-red spectra of both diols as well as those of the corresponding acetals showed close agreement; all spectra included a band due to metnoxyl. The mass spectra of phthiocerol A and its corresponding acetal were in agreement with the structure (V) for phthiocerol A. The mass spectra of phthiocerol B and its acetal were analogous to those of phthiocerol A but the molecular ions were fourteen units lower in mass. A detailed comparison of the intermediate fragments in the above spectra led to the conclusion that phthiocerol B is a mixture of diols having the structure (VI), where n is 22 and 20 (VI) OMe OH OH    |    |    | CH 3.

The impure sample of phthiodiolone ethylidene acetal contained a chromatographically similar compound, and in order to remove the impurity the acetal was heated with ethanol containing toluene- p -sulphonic acid and converted essentially to the diol. This was acetylated and the oxime prepared and purified by chromatography giving the oxime of diacetylphthiodiolone A, m. p. 38 Â° (named by analogy with phthiocerol A). This chromatography also gave a small amount of the oxime of the etnylidene acetal of phthiodiolone A, the acetal grouping having partially survived the above hydrolysis. The diacetoxy-oxime was subjected to a two-stage hydrolysis to give phthiodiolone A, m. p. 76. 5 Â°, [α] 20 589 - 2. 7 Â°; a portion was re-converted into phthiodiolone A ethylidene acetal, m. p. 41 - 42 °. Mass spectra of phthiodiolone A, its acetal and the oxime of this acetal, in conjunction with n. m. r. evidence, confirmed that phthiodiolone A is a mixture of diols having the structure (VII) where n is 22 and 20, respectively.
