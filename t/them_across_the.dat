5|$|Between November 1775 and February 1776, Colonel Henry Knox {{and a team}} of {{engineers}} used sledges to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. Bringing <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> frozen Hudson and Connecticut rivers in a difficult, complex operation, they arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776.|$|E
5|$|In 191 BC, Antiochus the Great, the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia, invaded Greece. The Romans {{decided to}} {{intervene}} and they defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae. The defeat by Rome forced the Seleucids to retreat back to Asia Minor. The Romans followed <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Aegean Sea and together with their allies, Pergamum, they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's {{limited use}} of the apartment led to another proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw little reason to move <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular {{use of the}} apartment.|$|E

5|$|On 5 July 1919, {{the order}} to {{transfer}} the Marine units to the Services of Supply branch for transport back to the United States was given. Ten days later, {{the last of the}} Marines boarded trains which took them to ports from where they would join transports that were to take <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. The 6th Machine Gun Battalion embarked aboard the Santa Paula and arrived in New York on 5 August 1919.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Norfolk Regiment, {{had become}} {{isolated}} from their regiment. They occupied and defended a farmhouse against {{an attack by}} Waffen-SS forces {{in the village of}} Le Paradis. After running out of ammunition, the defenders surrendered to the German troops. The Germans led <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> road to a wall and machine-gunned them. Ninety-seven British troops died. Two survived, with injuries, and hid until they were captured by German forces several days later.|$|E

5|$|The planned Pecheneg {{attack from}} the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to {{transport}} <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the union}} {{took place in}} the first two days of June, Archduke Charles, {{supported}} by Hotze's command, attacked French positions at Zürich. In first Battle of Zürich, on 4–7 June 1799, Hotze commanded the entire left wing of Archduke Charles' army, which included 20 battalions of infantry, plus support artillery, and 27 squadrons of cavalry, in total, 19,000 men. Despite being wounded, he remained on the field. His troops not only pushed the French back, but harassed their retreat, forcing <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Limmat river, where they took up defensive positions.|$|E

5|$|SS General Kurt Meyer, {{commander}} of the 12th SS Panzer Division, had already ordered infantry from various formations shattered by the bombers and by the armoured attack, to occupy Cintheaux. He also moved forward two battlegroups from his division, consisting of assault guns, infantry and Tiger tanks, positioning <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Canadian front. Shortly after midday, he ordered these two battlegroups to counter-attack the leading Allied troops. At this point, the Allied offensive plan called for additional bombardment by the Eighth Air Force, before the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Polish Armoured Division pushed south towards Falaise {{on either side of}} the Caen–Falaise Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community. The neutral zone was in section Z, {{on the same side of}} the ground as the Liverpool fans. The two groups thus stood yards apart, separated only by chicken wire. At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up and throw <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> divide.|$|E

As Snake kills Slag, the Duke learns of Brain's treachery and rallies his gang to chase them. Snake, Brain, Maggie, and the President race to the World Trade Center {{in an attempt to}} use Snake's glider to escape from Manhattan. After a group of crazies destroy it, the group returns to the street and {{encounters}} Cabbie, who offers to take <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45 on 25 November an Ottoman cavalry patrol near Khurbet Hadrah was chased {{off by a}} {{troop of}} 3rd Squadron Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment. Within an hour, the Ottoman 3rd and 7th Divisions {{launched}} a heavy attack on the squadron, which withdrew to a prearranged line. Just 30minutes later another withdrawal was forced. At about 08:00 infantry units of the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Khurbet Hadrah were ordered back across the river. It was an extremely difficult operation as the bridge was now being swept by enemy fire and continuously shelled by artillery. Some individuals succeeded in crossing the bridge; some swam the river and some drowned. Once the infantry were clear, the 3rd Squadron, Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment followed <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The 11th (North Auckland) Squadron (Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment) covered them with two Vickers guns at great cost, continuing to hold the bridge until 11:00, when they withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of Gradiška, and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Una River.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E

5|$|Embuscade was {{the next}} to surrender, having been {{battered}} in the opening exchanges by Magnanime, and further damaged by long-range fire from Foudroyant during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, Captain de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. Magnanime, suffering the effects of her engagement with Hoche, took possession of Embuscade and continued to follow slowly behind {{the rest of the}} fleet, while Robust, which had suffered severely in her duel with Hoche, remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the Foudroyant. Most of the frigates were able outrun this ponderous enemy, but Bellone was less fortunate and a speculative shot from the battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by Melampus and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling Coquille surrendered after being outrun by the approaching Canada; Warren ordered the slowly following Magnanime to take possession.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the railway}} line, the 156th and 10th Parachute Battalions became engaged with the German {{defensive}} line as {{they attempted to}} seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek. Both battalions' advances were blunted against the well-defended German positions and by early afternoon they had not advanced any further than their original positions. Urquhart—realising the need to assume a more defensive stance and prevent the two battalions being cut off north of the railway—ordered them to fall back to Wolfheze and Oosterbeek. Making a fighting withdrawal with the Germans of Kampfgruppe Krafft closely pursuing them, the units fell back across LZ 'L', defended by the King's Own Scottish Borderers who were awaiting {{the arrival of the}} Glider borne elements of the Polish Parachute Brigade. Heavy fighting ensued as the gliders arrived {{in the middle of the}} retreat and Polish losses were heavy. All four Allied units streamed south and west toward the road crossings over the steep railway cutting at Oosterbeek and Wolfheze and gathered in ad hoc units in the woods on the south side, where most of them spent the night. Some German units followed <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> railway and an SS battalion reached Wolfheze where it was strafed by its own air force.|$|E
5|$|Operating near Taegu {{during the}} Battle of Taegu, {{elements}} of the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were surrounded by North Korean troops crossing the Naktong River at Hill 303. Most of the U.S. troops were able to escape but one platoon of mortar operators misidentified North Korean troops as South Korean army reinforcements and was captured. North Korean troops held the Americans on the hill and initially tried to move <b>them</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river {{and out of the}} battle, but they were unable to do so because of heavy counterattack. American forces eventually broke the North Korean advance, routing the force. As the North Koreans began to retreat one of their officers ordered the prisoners to be shot so they would not slow the North Koreans down.|$|E
