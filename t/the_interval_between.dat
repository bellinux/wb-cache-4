5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|The final lap of {{the trail}} to Saint Paul, which had {{replaced}} Mendota as the principal entrepôt for the cart trade, continued along the sandplain on the east bank of the Mississippi. This route ran within {{a few miles of}} the river to Saint Anthony Falls and the community of that name which was growing on the east bank of the Mississippi. The trail then left the river and crossed open country to Saint Paul. The carters camped on the uplands west of the steamboat landing during <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> their arrival with the furs and their return to the north with supplies and trade goods.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> {{the award}} and the {{accomplishment}} it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E
30|$|To {{relocate}} all of {{the control}} points to epipolar image space requires the determination of all of <b>the</b> <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> neighboring control points on the horizontal lines approximated by each piecewise epipolar curve. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> all of <b>the</b> neighboring control points on the vertical lines have to be computed in the same way.|$|R
50|$|Peak {{elevations}} of 14 floods {{as early}} as 1501 on the Danube River at Passau, Germany, reveal great variability in <b>the</b> actual <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> floods. Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of <b>the</b> <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of <b>the</b> nominal average <b>interval.</b> Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.|$|R

5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{continued}} to enjoy some form with the bat with 33* against Nottinghamshire in <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> {{the fifth and}} final Tests, though he went wicketless. On 27 August, Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval. The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border, while Willis took four wickets and Botham six. A century from Boycott then defied Lillee's seven wicket haul to take England to 314, and in reply Hendrick and Botham took four wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis went without a wicket in the second innings. With half-centuries from Gatting and Brearley, England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw. England were victorious in the series 3:1, and Botham's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as 'Botham's Ashes'.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{had been}} limited {{to a maximum of}} seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, {{beginning}} the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no election was absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the Monarch under the Royal Prerogative on request of the Prime Minister. It should be noted, however, that the five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the Parliament, and not to <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> general elections. For example, the 2010 general election was held five years and one day after the 2005 general election, whilst the 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992 and the next general election was not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in Parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, calls for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provides for dissolution of Parliament only by operation of law prior to each election; it abolished dissolution under the Royal Prerogative.|$|E
