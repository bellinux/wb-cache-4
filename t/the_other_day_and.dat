500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There {{was a time when}} Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keegan had {{a clause}} {{inserted}} into his contract {{when he joined}} Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back. Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause {{when he returned to}} England three years later.

2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant.

3000|$|It {{is clear}} from Fig.  4 that all the {{measured}} and computed glass cover average temperature trends {{as well as the}} ambient are similar in that they gradually start to increase in the morning with the increased radiation intensity, reaching a maximum early afternoon due to the thermal capacity of the system and decreasing slightly in the afternoon as the radiation drops off till 5.00  p.m. The predicted glass cover average temperature matched the corresponding experimental measurements reasonably closely, with best agreement at ṁ of 0.288  kg/h. It should be noted here that the temperature [...] T_g, inside for a mass flow rate ṁ of 0.288 is higher than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>days</b> because <b>the</b> hourly measured irradiation values (8.00 a. m. to 5.00  p.m.) during the day 11 of April 2007 is the highest compared with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>days</b> 12, 13, <b>and</b> 14 th of April 2007. Consequently, the temperatures of [...] T_g, inside and [...] T_g, outside of the glass cover would be higher on 11 April (Fig.  4 a). Furthermore, it is observed that that the difference in temperature between [...] T_g, inside and [...] T_g, outside shown in Fig.  4 a is the highest compared with that of <b>other</b> <b>days.</b> This {{can be attributed to the}} higher values of hourly measured irradiation on the 11 th of April compared with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> to <b>the</b> lowest mass flow rate of brine water.|$|R

On February 16, 1954, the Camel News Caravan became the first news program broadcast in color, making use of 16mm color film. In early 1955, the R.J.

The program featured a young Washington correspondent named David Brinkley, and competed against Douglas Edwards with the News on rival CBS.
