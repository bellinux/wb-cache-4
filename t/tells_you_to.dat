Busta Rhymes is {{featured}} on one remix, to which BET Sound Off preferred to the original version, commenting, [...] "Not that I don’t appreciate Keri and Weezy’s version because it’s actually a snazzy lil ditty, but Busta’s ambiance over Polow’s sound scape gives me a different vibe, that 'stand on your desk and mean mug everyone in your office who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> turn down your music' vibe." [...] In January 2010, a remix featuring T.I. was released. A MSTRKRFT remix of the original version was released on iTunes.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know what you know you can do, not what everybody else <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Wesley was {{initially}} {{designed to be}} a foil for the character of Rupert Giles. Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions [...] "with the tools that they had"; he was conceived as a [...] "nemesis" [...] for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley's first episode [...] "Bad Girls", explains, [...] "The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies." [...] He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the [...] "stuffy guy from England who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> sit up straight and obey the rules", introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits [...] "to the nth degree", allows Giles to become [...] "subversive" [...] and [...] "cool". Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E
2500|$|In the lead-up to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Wang {{was seen}} by {{observers}} as a rising political star, with a diverse political pedigree spanning the realms of high finance, regional government, and policy development and execution. Wang ultimately entered {{the ranks of the}} Politburo Standing Committee, considered the pinnacle of power in China, at the 18th Party Congress, taking on the job of the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body. Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the same Congress. [...] The appointment was unexpected given Wang's experience in the economic realm; he was seen as a more likely candidate for executive Vice-Premier. [...] The decision to hand Wang the disciplinary portfolio seemed to have come as a surprise even to Wang himself: in video footage of a leaked CCDI conference after taking the helm of the body, Wang said of the decision, [...] "you can go look at media reports before the 18th Congress, who knew Wang Qishan was going to become secretary of the CCDI?... That's how things work. You do what the party <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Command {{hallucinations}} {{are sometimes}} used {{in defense of}} a crime, often homicides. In essence, it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do. Sometimes the commands are quite benign directives such as [...] "Stand up" [...] or [...] "Shut the door." [...] Whether it is a command for something simple or something that is a threat, it is still considered a [...] "command hallucination." [...] Some helpful questions that can assist one in figuring out if he/she may be suffering from this include: [...] "What are the voices <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do?", [...] "When did your voices first start <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do things?", [...] "Do you recognize {{the person who is}} <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> harm yourself (or others)?", [...] "Do you think you can resist doing what the voices are <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R

6000|$|And lastly. You {{women of}} England are all now shrieking with one voice,--you and your clergymen together,--because you hear of your Bibles being attacked. If {{you choose to}} obey your Bibles, you will never care who attacks them. It is just because you never fulfil a single downright precept of the Book, that you are so careful for its credit: and just because you don't care to obey its whole words, that you are so {{particular}} about the letters of them. The Bible <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> dress plainly,--and you are mad for finery; the Bible <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have pity on the poor,--and you crush them under your carriage-wheels; the Bible <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do judgment and justice,--and you do not know, nor care to know, so much as what the Bible word 'justice means.'
