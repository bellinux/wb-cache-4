5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate <b>that</b> <b>teachers</b> and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The aims of this {{research}} are {{to find out the}} kinds of persuasive utterances <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> used in classroom interaction and to know the role of persuasive utterances in the classroom interaction. The samples of {{this research}} are the teacher and the students of the eighth grade at SMP Negeri 1 Pallangga, Gowa. The approach employed in this research is qualitative. The type {{of this research}} belongs to discourse analysis (DA). Data collection of this research was conducted through (1) recording, (2) observation, and (3) interview. The data gathered was analysed through discourse analysis which was used in analysing the kinds of persuasive utterances <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> used in the classroom interaction and the role of persuasive utterances in the classroom interaction. The research findings show that in teaching-learning process there were three kinds of persuasive utterances and five techniques of persuasive utterances <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> used in made interaction with the students. Those are ethos, pathos, logos, association technique, integration technique, reward technique, arrangement technique and red-herring technique. Pathos was the dominant persuasive utterances <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> used in interaction. The data shown that there was 149 times pathos utterances <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> used from 295 utterances from the first recording until the third recording. The ethos persuasive utterances was used 84 times, logos was used 41 times, arrangement technique was used 19 times, reward technique was used 17 times, association technique was used 10 times, integration technique was used 7 times and red-herring technique was used twice (2 x). The researcher also found the positive role to the students in the classroom at SMP Negeri 1 Pallangga, Gowa.

25|$|Practical {{difficulties}} included recruiting teachers {{by ethnic}} group rather than language ability. Consequently, some teachers {{were expected to}} teach their ethnic language even if their ability was poor while other teachers, who could speak the ethnic language, were not recruited. Teachers who could speak the local language had no training in its structure or written form. Local languages could lack standardization and their vocabularies might be too limited to cover the curriculum. Lack of dictionaries and grammar books meant <b>that</b> <b>teachers</b> had no guide to {{the proper use of}} language and textbooks were the only written material to help students with reading. One solution to these problems has been to allow bilingual instruction and Amharic sections in some schools.|$|E
25|$|Most voice {{teachers}} {{believe that}} it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop. Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest <b>that</b> <b>teachers</b> begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The {{reason for this is that}} the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.|$|E
