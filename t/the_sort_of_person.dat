500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All {{the little things that}} might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who wakes {{up in the morning and}} needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests that he is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect." ...|$|E

They were <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> who feel a vague sense of injury when anybody looks at them, perhaps because they feel that those whose attention is attracted to them must say something to their discredit when they begin to talk about them.|$|R

60|$|Behind them, {{there are}} two rough figures, busied with their own affairs,--two of Joachim's shepherds; one, bare headed, the other wearing the wide Florentine cap with the falling point behind, which is exactly like the tube of a {{larkspur}} or violet; both carrying game, and {{talking to each other}} about--Greasy Joan and her pot, or the like. Not at all <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> whom you would have thought in harmony with the scene;--by the laws of the drama, according to Racine or Voltaire.|$|R
500|$|In July 2009, Conservative Party strategists {{identified}} [...] "Holby City woman" [...] {{as a key}} voter demographic who {{may help}} the party win the 2010 General Election. The [...] "Holby City woman" [...] archetype is modelled on Faye, a female voter in her 30s or 40s, employed in a clinical or clerical position or some other public sector job. She is a swing voter in General Elections, who has voted for the Labour Party in previous elections, though her identification with the Labour Party is not strong. Jonathan Oliver for The Times noted that [...] "Faye Morton, the Holby City staff nurse played by Patsy Kensit is just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> that Cameron might now hope to recruit".|$|E
500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that {{you always have to}} work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
60|$|He was careful, of course, to {{take away}} their memory of their walks and conversations afterwards, but {{otherwise}} he did not interfere; and Dan and Una would find <b>the</b> strangest <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> in their gardens or woods.|$|R

Here comes Elizabeth. Let's watch her." ...|$|R
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E

"Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "the {{reason that}} social reform is so {{urgently}} needed {{in so many}} ways is for that very reason, Miss Bullsom--that <b>the</b> wrong <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> has been going in for it. Looking after the poor has meant for most people handing out bits of charity on the toasting-fork of religion.

5000|$|Branches were {{established}} {{across the country}} and the first national convention was held on 27 November 1915 at the Congregational Memorial Hall. The second convention was held the following year on April 8 at Devonshire House — a Quaker meeting place in Bishopsgate. Beatrice Webb, who was pro-war, recorded the occasion in her diary, The Friends' Meeting House ... was packed with some 2,000 young men — the National Convention of the No-Conscription Fellowship. ... Among the 2,000 were many diverse types. The intellectual pietist, slender in figure, delicate in feature and complexion, benevolent in expression was the dominant type. These youths were saliently conscious of their own righteousness. ... On the platform were the sympathisers with the movement — exactly <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> you would expect to find at such a meeting — older pacifists and older rebels — Bertrand Russell, Robert Trevelyan, George Lansbury, Olive Schreiner, Lupton, Stephen and Rosa Hobhouse, Dr Clifford, C.H. Norman, Miss Llewelyn Davies and the Snowdens: the pacifist predominating over the rebel element.|$|R
500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E
2500|$|Alan D. Solomont, {{who led a}} {{group that}} raised $35 million for John Kerry in 2004, signed on with the {{campaign}}, saying Obama [...] "is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> America wants in the White House right now." [...] Other fundraisers that joined the campaign included David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Mark Gorenberg.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Nikki Wilson {{described}} Captain Adelaide Brooke, {{played by}} actress Lindsay Duncan, as [...] "the Doctor's cleverest and most strong-minded companion yet." [...] David Tennant said, [...] "Well, she's {{not really a}} companion like the others have been... She's very wary of the Doctor; she's not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> you could imagine hooking up with him and riding off into the sunset... she's kind of the alpha male in the room, really. So, the Doctor has to learn to assume a slightly different role when he's around her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That the {{one is a}} robber, and {{the other}} an adventuress," [...] Duncombe answered. [...] "This much is {{certainly}} true. They have both left Runton Place at a moment's notice, and without taking leave of their host and hostess. Remember, I never knew Phyllis Poynton. You did! Ask yourself whether she is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> young <b>person</b> to obtain hospitality under false pretences, and then abuse it--to associate herself in a fraud with a self-confessed robber." ...|$|R
6000|$|The clerk {{behind the}} counter was quite <b>the</b> wrong <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> for Jimmy to have had {{dealings}} with in his present mood. What Jimmy needed was a grave, sensible man who would have {{laid a hand on}} his shoulder and said [...] "Do nothing rash, my boy!" [...] The clerk fell short of this ideal in practically every particular. He was about twenty-two, and he seemed perfectly enthusiastic about the idea of Jimmy going to America. He beamed at Jimmy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad you've {{made friends}} with her," [...] the Colonel said. [...] "She's a harum-scarum lot, I'm afraid, and a sad chatterbox, but she's <b>the</b> right <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person</b> {{for a man with}} nerves like you! You're looking a bit white still, I see!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Because {{the serial}} {{was set in}} the near future, both Hoyle and Michael Hayes felt that women would occupy more {{progressive}} roles {{in the years to}} come. This was reflected in the writing and casting; appearing as the security services agent, Judy Adamson, was Patricia Kneale. Kneale found the character [...] "a rather prissy sort of person, not really <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> I usually played at all." [...] A late change to the script was changing the sex of the biologist character, George Dawnay, to Madeline Dawnay; writing to Mary Morris offering her the part, Hayes said, [...] "don't be put off {{by the fact that the}} lady appears to smoke a pipe half way through and give vent to some rather strange utterances." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a shame {{for this}} to happen to Alan," [...] said captain Kim Hughes. [...] "He's no sloucher. I don't think he's ever come off a cricket ground in his life. He will be staying with us {{throughout}} the fourth Test.... Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> he is... He really struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but it's no use now... He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do himself permanent damage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{at first}} {{appearing}} as an immature prankster, Lionel's second stint saw the character {{develop into a}} more sensitive character with [...] "little-boy-lost" [...] vulnerability. John Leigh described Lionel as likeable, stating; [...] "Lionel is this great trier. That's why people have latched on to him. He doesn't have all the swankiness of the doctors – their money and their looks. A lot of people always see themselves as falling a bit short of the mark and everyone does in some way. People identity with this struggle." [...] Leigh {{found it difficult to}} understand how Lionel attracted women, saying, [...] "Lionel is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> you want to meet when you're ready to settle down. He's a nice guy. You can trust him. He can cook. He can fix things. None of these things is exciting to a young woman." ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 1973, at {{the time}} of his {{resignation}} from the government, friends are quoted as saying: If he has a fault it is because he wears his weaknesses on his sleeve. He is too frank.

6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{gave her}} {{companion}} {{one of those}} fitful glances of almost grateful appreciation with which their intercourse was even at its darkest hours frequently illumined. [...] "As {{if he were the}} Primate or the French Ambassador? Yes, you're right--one couldn't do it; though it's very odd and one doesn't quite see why. It does place him. But he becomes thereby exactly <b>the</b> very <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> with whom it would be most of an advantage for her to go about. What a pity," [...] Mrs. Brook sighed, [...] "he doesn't know more people!" ...|$|R
2500|$|At the University of Washington in February 2006, a {{resolution}} recommending a memorial be erected to honor fighter ace and alumnus Pappy Boyington for his service during World War II was raised and defeated {{during a meeting}} of the student senate. Some people did not believe the resolution's sponsor had fully addressed the financial and logistical problems of installing a memorial, and some were questioning the widely held assumption that all warriors and acts of war are automatically worthy of memorialization. The story was picked up by some blogs and conservative news outlets, focusing on two statements made by student senators during the meeting. One student senator, Ashley Miller, said that the UW already had many monuments to [...] "rich, white men" [...] (Boyington claimed partial Sioux ancestry and was not rich); another, Jill Edwards, questioned whether the UW should memorialize a person who killed others, summarized in the minutes as saying [...] "she didn't believe a member of the Marine Corps was an example of <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> UW wanted to produce." ...|$|E
