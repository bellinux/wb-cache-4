Chandrakanta Abhidhan (1933) says they were originally hills people, now living in Arunachal pradesh and Assam plains as a priestly class of the Sutiyas.|$|R

5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage.

5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than}} the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E

40|$|Background: Increasing {{complexity}} and quality requirements {{in the health}} care system require that nursing students posses good practical skills. Internationally and domestically, this has lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increased use of simulation in preclinical studies in nursing education. In Norway, preclinical and clinical studies constitute 50 % of nursing education. Nursing students can, through simulation with a computer-driven patient manikin, train connecting theory and practice together. In this way, students can become better prepared {{to meet the demands of}} clinical studies. The aim of the study was to evaluate the nursing students’ experiences connected to learning during use of a simulation manikin in preclinical studies during first-year undergraduate studies. Methods: The study had a descriptive case study design. The evaluation included information, preparation, completion and implementation of learning goals during simulation in preclinical studies. The study encompassed two first-year classes. The data collection occurred post simulation through the means of <b>a</b> questionnaire given <b>to</b> 100 nursing students from the class of 2009 and 116 nursing students from the class of 2010. Predictive Analytics SoftWare for Vista was used for statistical analysis and the inductive content analysis of the replies to the open questions. Results: Student evaluations show that use of simulation in preclinical studies was a positive experience and that the students have realized the day’s learning goals, despite criticism of the technical equipment, for example camera angle and lighting. In total, 88 % of the nursing students answered that the observation of peers was beneficial <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>or</b> very <b>great</b> extent, and 89. 4 % experienced that reflection during debriefing was beneficial <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>or</b> very <b>great</b> extent. <b>A</b> correlation existed between students who responded that the observation of peers was beneficial and that reflection during debriefing was beneficial. About 77. 8 % of nursing students were well prepared for simulation. Qualitative analysis showed that a small number of students experienced discomfort when being observed during a simulation. Feedback from peers and instructors during debriefing was experienced as being very instructive. Being able to communicate with the simulation manikin was experienced as being positive. Conclusions: Nursing students experienced simulation as being a beneficial learning method and requested more simulation during their education. They expressed that simulation provided good practical and theoretical learning...|$|R
