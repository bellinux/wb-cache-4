50|$|In February 2007 the Kurchatov Institute won the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the main}} {{organization}} coordinating efforts in nanotechnology in Russia.|$|R
50|$|Dyer & Blair won the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the {{transaction}} adviser for the USD 840 Million Safaricom IPO. This <b>was</b> <b>to</b> the largest offering in the Eastern Africa region.|$|R
50|$|The {{results for}} this <b>tender</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{announced}} before June 2011.|$|R
25|$|The Green line's {{plans have}} been {{approved}} by the city of Jerusalem, with right-of-way clearing works underway and construction <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> issued soon, while the approval process on the Blue line has started.|$|R
50|$|The first Great Lakes <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{specifically}} {{built for}} that purpose, she {{was built in}} 1874 by Neafie & Levy and placed into commission at Detroit. The ship was refitted in 1881, and again in 1891.|$|R
50|$|The Simon Lake was {{the first}} {{submarine}} <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stationed at Kings Bay Georgia in 1979 when the base first opened and {{was the first}} tender on the east coast that women served on in the U.S. Navy.|$|R
50|$|New {{technologies}} {{and the end}} of the cold war led to the base being deemed unnecessary. The last submarine <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> based there, the , left Holy Loch in November 1991, ahead of the base closing the following June.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is a very}} {{successful}} indoor plant where it <b>is</b> too <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> grown outdoors, and thrives on [...] "healthy neglect". It prefers not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in full sun, but is very tolerant of under-watering, and flowers better if restricted in a small pot.|$|R
60|$|This hallowed work {{of genius}} shows what {{pictorial}} art, devoutly exercised, might effect {{in behalf of}} religious truth; involving, as it does, deeper mysteries of revelation, and bringing them closer to man's heart, and making him <b>tenderer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impressed by them, than the most eloquent words of preacher or prophet.|$|R
50|$|In December 2010, Navalny {{announced}} {{the launch of}} the RosPil project, which seeks to bring to light corrupt practices in the government procurement process. The project takes advantage of existing procurement regulation that requires all government requests for <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> posted online. Information about winning bids must be posted online as well.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the stern}} {{section of the}} Tamar-class {{lifeboat}} is a built-in, recessed chamber which houses the small inflatable Y-class lifeboat. Access <b>to</b> this inflatable <b>tender</b> <b>is</b> achieved by lifting a section of deck and lowering a transom which doubles as a ramp. This allows the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily launched and recovered.|$|R
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the <b>tenders</b> {{remained}} wedded <b>to</b> their original locomotives, others received new partners - {{the very first}} <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, it <b>was</b> difficult <b>to</b> spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined <b>tenders</b> <b>were</b> married <b>to</b> unstreamlined locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 a {{commemorative}} 5 guilder coin {{was struck}} {{in honour of}} the UEFA Euro 2000 in the Netherlands and Belgium. The 5 guilder coin was withdrawn from circulation on 28 January 2002 following {{the introduction of the}} euro. It remained <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exchanged for currency of the euro until 1 January 2007.|$|R
50|$|Burness Corlett {{predicted}} that either design would take approximately 21 months to construct, {{and that if}} the new ferries <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced in 1978 as planned, an aggressive construction program would have to begin immediately, with <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called no later than April 1976 (the report was not even released until three months after this date).|$|R
50|$|After many delays, Sarawak Energy Berhad {{announced}} that the contract to build the submarine cable would be awarded in mid-2010 with international <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called in early 2010. It was expected that the construction would be completed by 2015 at an estimated cost of MYR8 billion to MYR10 billion. However, the project has been shelved.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Daniel co-founded the {{e-government}} solution company [...] "Auftrag.at" [...] with {{a direct}} co-ownership {{of the government}} owned publication [...] "Wiener Zeitung". They lobbied <b>to</b> allow public <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published on business websites. The company received Austria's Federal Award of Excellence in 2002 and has become the de facto standard for public tenders in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Invitation <b>to</b> <b>Tender</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> {{issued in}} October 2012, with the {{successful}} bidder announced 4-6 months later. However, {{in the wake}} of the InterCity West Coast refranchising process collapsing, the government announced in October 2012 that the process would be put on hold pending the results of a review.|$|R
5000|$|On February 3, Malihi {{recommended}} that Obama {{remain on the}} ballot. Concerning Taitz's case Malihi wrote: [...] "The Court finds {{the testimony of the}} witnesses, as well as the exhibits <b>tendered,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of little, if any, probative value, and thus wholly insufficient to support plaintiffs’ allegations". [...] The Drudge Retort described the hearing as, [...] "Empty Table 1, Orly Taitz 0".|$|R
50|$|In 2002 Skytraders {{was chosen}} out of 7 <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the {{official}} air link to Antarctica. According to the ABC their world-renowned safety systems won them the tender. They operate an Airbus Corporate Jet between Hobart {{and a hard}} glacier runway near Casey Station. The service aims to provide 25 flights each summer, with the first flights launching {{in the summer of}} 2003-2004.|$|R
50|$|Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561 is an English {{contract}} law case concerning {{the requirements of}} offer and acceptance {{in the formation of}} a contract. The case established that an offer inviting <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> submitted for the purchase of stock did not amount to an offer capable of acceptance to sell that stock, but rather amounted to an invitation to treat.|$|R
60|$|All {{this had}} its effects. Of Norman's {{rejected}} love they {{neither of them}} spoke. Each knew that the other {{must be aware of}} it, but the subject <b>was</b> far too <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> touched, at any rate as yet. And so matters went on, and Alaric regained the footing of favour which he had for a while lost with the mistress of the house.|$|R
5000|$|Fallplates between {{engines and}} <b>tenders</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of {{sufficient}} length to obviate the plate falling between the buffer beams {{in the event}} of drawbar failure, and emergency chains or links had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adjusted in this regard, where necessary.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a person}} is only an {{employee}} when such person actually works for another person. The employee must therefore have rendered a service to another which services are not that sic of an independent contractor. In addition to working for another the employee must also [...] "receive" [...] or <b>be</b> [...] "entitled <b>to</b> receive" [...] remuneration. The remuneration referred to must correspondingly mean remuneration for work done or <b>tendered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done.|$|R
25|$|Banknotes do {{not have}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> classed as legal <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{acceptable}} for trade; millions of retail transactions are carried out each day in the UK using debit cards and credit cards, none {{of which is a}} payment using legal tender. Equally, traders may offer to accept payment in foreign currency, such as Euro, Yen or US Dollars. Acceptability as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved.|$|R
25|$|The Bhutanese {{ngultrum}} is pegged at {{par with}} the Indian rupee; both currencies are accepted in Bhutan. The Nepalese rupee is pegged at 0.625; the Indian rupee is accepted in Bhutan and Nepal, except 500 and 1000 banknotes, which are not legal tender in Bhutan and Nepal and are banned by their respective governments, though accepted by many retailers. On 29 January 2014, Zimbabwe added the Indian rupee as a legal <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|R
50|$|When the Air Ministry felt {{progress}} on the Westland Whirlwind cannon-armed fighter was too slow, they asked for the F.18/37 <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> revised with 20mm cannon armament. Supermarine dropped the pusher design and proposed a six-cannon fighter as the Type 327. The Ministry did not feel its advantages outweighed other considerations, and that the Whirlwind - or the adaption of the Bristol Beaufort - would enter service before Supermarine's design could.|$|R
60|$|According to the {{manners of}} the times, the master and his {{attendant}} {{sat at the}} same table, and the latter observed, with regret, how little attention Tressilian paid to his meal. He recollected, indeed, the pain he had given by mentioning the maiden in whose company he had first seen him; but, fearful of touching upon a topic too <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tampered with, he chose to ascribe his abstinence to another cause.|$|R
25|$|The {{franchise}} <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> end in August 2019. The Invitation <b>to</b> <b>Tender</b> <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{issued in}} April 2018, which will detail what improvements bidders for the franchise must make. The contract {{will then be}} awarded in April 2019.|$|R
50|$|In March 2012 the Department for Transport {{announced}} that Abellio, FirstGroup, Govia, MTR and Stagecoach had been shortlisted {{for the new}} Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. The Invitation <b>to</b> <b>Tender</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> issued in October 2012, with the successful bidder announced in spring 2013. However, {{in the wake of}} the collapse of the InterCity West Coast refranchising process, the government announced in October 2012 that the process would be put on hold pending the results of a review.|$|R
50|$|The {{frames of}} a Great Eastern Railway tender, fitted with an {{original}} axle from 2802 'Walsingham', and a LNER tender have been secured {{for the project}} and are now based on the Mid-Norfolk Railway, where the LNER <b>tender</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cosmetically restored for display.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{difficulty}} {{experienced in}} coupling {{any combination of}} engine and <b>tender,</b> had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reported <b>to</b> {{the office of the}} Chief Mechanical Engineer.|$|R
25|$|On 24 June Bland {{called for}} <b>tenders,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{received}} at the Resident Councillor's Office by noon 12 September 1908 for supply and erection of steel work for thirty two corrugated iron buildings at Pulau Jerejak. The work took {{much longer than}} first estimated. In {{the first week of}} January 1910, just a few months before he retired and left the Colony, Bland escorted Governor John Anderson on an inspection of the work in progress there.|$|R
50|$|The {{designs for}} a 2-8-2 Mikado type tank-and-tender {{locomotive}} were drawn up in 1887 by William Milne, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Natal Government Railways (NGR). It {{was built in}} the Durban workshops of the NGR at a cost of £3,021 and was not only the first locomotive and <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed and built in South Africa, but also the first in South Africa to have eight-coupled wheels. Only the wheels and axles were obtained from England.|$|R
50|$|The 19·6 km Green {{line will}} link the two campuses of the Hebrew University and {{continue}} south via Pat junction to Gilo. It will pass the Binyanei-Hauma terminus of the A1 fast line railway, then cross the existing Red Line tram route and run to Mount Scopus. There would be 36 stops, and ridership is predicted at 200 000 passengers/day. The line {{was approved by}} the Jerusalem city council in June 2016, with <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> issued shortly after.|$|R
50|$|The 31 km T-way {{links the}} railway {{stations}} at Parramatta and Liverpool via {{a series of}} bus-only roadways and bus lanes. Services using the T-way are operated by Transit Systems Sydney. Before that, these services were operated by Western Sydney Buses (a subsidiary of the State Transit Authority). They were under Sydney Bus Region 3 and <b>were</b> transferred <b>to</b> Transit Systems Sydney on 13 October 2013, after it <b>was</b> awarded the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the new operator of the region including the T-way.|$|R
