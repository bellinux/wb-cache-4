40|$|An {{analytical}} model is developed to evaluate airtightness, {{which is one}} of the most important requirements of vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>transportation</b> systems. The main objective of the model is to anticipate the pressure inside a closed structure, which initially decreases and then rises with time owing to the inflow of the air outside. The model is formulated by using Darcy’s law and by solving the differential equations that consider the air permeability of the material and physical configuration of the tube. Equations are derived for a tube section in two cases: one with constant thickness and another with variable thickness. Although the developed model must be verified experimentally, results simulated by using the model with several assumed sections were consistent with the findings of a previous study. The mathematical model developed here to predict the behavior of the pressure inside a vacuum tube structure could be effectively used to evaluate the airtightness of vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>transportation</b> systems. Such data could provide background technical information for the practical design of the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Evacuated <b>Tube</b> <b>Transportation</b> (ETT) will be {{the fastest}} traffic mode on earth in the future, {{possible}} over 6000 km/h, and low energy consumption, no air pollution, no noise and relatively safe. Different from pipelines for transporting oil, gas and water, the tube of ETT will bear the maglev vehicles running in it, {{and it should be}} with reliable airproof ability for keeping required vacuum in the tube. It’s significant to seriously select the proper materials for creating tube wall and design reasonable tube wall structure. In this paper two materials to be used most possibly, steel and concrete, are considered. In addition, some types of tube wall structure are analyzed. This paper also compares the differences on the manufacture, process and construction of ETT tube between the pure steel tube and concrete composite tube. At last, some conclusions are given, some suggestions are put up, and some issues that need to be further analyzed and studied are listed. 1.

30|$|The {{aerodynamic}} drag {{on a train}} running in an evacuated tube varies with tube air pressure, train speed and shape, as well as blockage ratio. This paper uses numerical simulations to {{study the effects of}} different factors on the {{aerodynamic drag}} of a train running at subsonic speed in an evacuated tube. Firstly, we present the assumption of a steady state, two dimensional, incompressible viscous flow with lubricity wall conditions. Subsequently, based on the Navier-Stokes equation and the k-ε turbulent models, we calculate the aerodynamic drag imposed on the column train with a 3 -meter diameter running under different pressure and blockage ratio conditions in an evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>transportation</b> (ETT) system. The simulation is performed with FLUENT 6.3 software package. An analyses of the simulation results suggest that the blockage ratio for ETT should be in the range of 0.25 – 0.7, and the tube internal diameter in the range of 2 – 4 m, with the feasible vacuum pressure in the range of 1 – 10 000 Pa for the future subsonic ETT trains.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} study the {{relationships}} between the aerodynamic drag of maglev and other factors in the evacuated tube, the formula of aerodynamic drag was deduced based on the basic equations of aerodynamics and then the calculated result was confirmed at a low speed on an experimental system developed by Superconductivity and New Energy R&D Center of South Jiaotong University. With regard to this system a high temperature superconducting magnetic levitation vehicle was motivated by a linear induction motor (LIM) fixed on the permanent magnetic guideway. When the vehicle reached an expected speed, the LIM was stopped. Then the damped speed was recorded and used to calculate the experimental drag. The two results show the approximately same relationship between the aerodynamic drag on the maglev and the other factors such as the pressure in the tube, the velocity of the maglev and the blockage ratio. Thus, the pressure, the velocity, and the blockage ratio are viewed as the three important factors that contribute to the energy loss in the evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>transportation.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{speed of}} {{traditional}} trains is limited {{because of the}} dynamic friction between {{the wheels of the}} train and the fixed rail on the ground. When the trains are running at a low speed, most of the energy is consumed by friction. The trains can be levitated above the rail to avoid such friction with the technology of magnetic levitation [1]. There are three types of levitation technologies: electromagnetic suspension (EMS), electrodynamic suspension (EDS), hybrid electromagnetic suspension (HEMS) [2]. Even with these three methods, the velocity of trains could not be improved remarkably because of the aerodynamic drag. When the trains run at low speeds, this drag is not evident. At high speeds, however, the aerodynamic drag is too large to be neglected. Whatever the trains are levitated or not, the aerodynamic drag is the dominate part of drag when it runs at a high speed in the atmosphere near the earth’s surface. At a speed range between 400 and 500  km/h, the aerodynamic drag accounts for 80  %– 90  % of the total drag including the aerodynamic drag, the eddy resistance force, and the braking force [3]. The train speed is much lower than the airplane speed because airplanes flight in a circumstance of rarefied gas in the high altitude. In view of this fact, the evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>transportation</b> (ETT) was proposed to reduce the aerodynamic drag and improve the speed of the maglev train. Shen [4] and Yan [5] discussed the possibility, strategy, and the technical proposal for developing the ETT in China.|$|E

Results: No statistical differences were observed for complete blood counts, white blood cell differential parameters, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and most chemistry parameters between PTS and hand-delivered transport procedures. Mean platelet volume results obtained from samples transported through PTS were lower than that obtained from samples transported through hand-delivered method (P = 0. 001).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{designing}} transportation network topology and traffic distribution under fluctuating conditions using a bio-inspired algorithm. The algorithm {{is inspired by}} the adaptive behavior observed in an amoeba-like organism, plasmodial slime mold, more formally known as plasmodium of Physarum plycephalum. This organism forms a transportation network to distribute its protoplasm, the fluidic contents of its cell, throughout its large cell body. In this process, {{the diameter of the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>tubes</b> adapts to the flux of the protoplasm. The Physarum algorithm, which mimics this adaptive behavior, has been widely applied to complex problems, such as maze solving and designing the topology of railroad grids, under static conditions. However, in most situations, environmental conditions fluctuate; for example, in power grids, the consumption of electric power shows daily, weekly, and annual periodicity depending on the lifestyles or the business needs of the individual consumers. This paper studies the design of network topology and traffic distribution with oscillatory input and output traffic flows. The network topology proposed by the Physarum algorithm is controlled by a parameter of the adaptation process of the tubes. We observe various rich topologies such as complete mesh, partial mesh, Y-shaped, and V-shaped networks depending on this adaptation parameter and evaluate them on the basis of three performance functions: loss, cost, and vulnerability. Our results indicate that consideration of the oscillatory conditions and the phase-lags in the multiple outputs of the network is important: The building and/or maintenance cost o...|$|R

40|$|The {{shear modulus}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} engineering parameters, and it relates directly to the soil's shear-wave velocity. Shear-wave velocities can be derived from both laboratory measurements (e. g., bender elements) and various field methods (seismic CPT, surface wave analysis, and shear-wave reflection/refraction surveys). The major advantage of field measurements is that the soil is tested in its natural state, thus mitigating the effects of sample disturbance caused by e. g. drilling, <b>tube</b> insertion, extraction, <b>transportation,</b> storage, trimming, and reconsolidation. In recent years, Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) has become a powerful and common method for obtaining in situ shear-wave velocity data that can subsequently be used for geotechnical site characterization. Whereas this method is proven, it is important to be aware of its potential pitfalls and limitations from survey design to final interpretation of the results. Indeed, the receiver and source geometry, the time sampling, the processing methods as well as the inversion method and parameters used may influence the resulting shear-wave velocity profile. All survey design, processing and analysis parameters should be thoughtfully chosen taking into account the given site as well as the target. In addition, lateral variations (inhomogeneity, dipping layers) disturb the 1 D assumption typically adopted in surface waves inversion. Therefore, it is important in engineering geophysics to investigate the reliability, potential and limitation of this prospecting method, properly take into account uncertainties and show that differences in sampling techniques and inversion may lead to differences in shear-wave velocity profiles and thus influence the site characterization. In this study, we present data from one MASW experiment nearby Trondheim. The receiver and shot-geometrical effects are revealed and the necessity for careful survey design as well as the need for systematic data evaluation is highlighted. Shear-wave velocity profiles were inverted using two different algorithms revealing discrepancies, hence the need for appropriate inversion parameter selection...|$|R

This method has several advantages compared to the currently used sampling method, for which UF 6 is distilled into a stainless steel <b>tube</b> for <b>transportation,</b> with hydrolysis and isotopic analysis being performed after shipping to the analytical laboratory. Using the Cristallini sampling method the transport is cheaper and relatively safer concerning radiological protection aspects. In order to be reliable for both scientific and nuclear safeguards applications, the Cristallini sampling method {{has been subjected to}} a rigorous validation program. This includes a variety of sampling materials and measurement methods for the isotopic analyses as well as numerous participating laboratories around the world. The involved organizations include laboratories in Argentina, Brazil (collaborating within ABACC), Germany, Belgium (sites of Joint Research Centre, JRC, in Karlsruhe and Geel, respectively), Austria (Safeguards Analytical Services Laboratory of the IAEA) and within the United States, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the NBL-Program office and ASTM. This technical report describes in particular the application of the "Double Spike" method by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (DS/TIMS) for the validation program of the Cristallini method, performed by staff from the unit JRC-G. 2 in Geel/Belgium (formerly IRMM) in collaboration with staff from SGAS/IAEA. The results are in good mutual agreement, but they reveal slight differences for the 235 U/ 238 U isotope ratios for samples taken by the Cristallini method compared to samples processed in the traditional manner by distillation and subsequent direct hydrolysis. For test samples prepared by ABACC using the IRMM- 020 (0. 2 % 235 U) and IRMM- 022 (0. 72 % 235 U) certified UF 6 reference materials, significant differences of about 0. 01 %- 0. 02 % were observed, but for test samples prepared from IRMM- 023 (3. 3 % 235 U) the differences are insignificant. The reason for the observed differences is not yet known, they can be due to fractionation, contamination or memory effects occurred during the sampling or subsequent chemical processing. The results from JRC-G. 2 and SGAS/IAEA using the double spike method play a special role within the validation program due to the high precision of this method. The results are proposed to be included for the intended standardization of the Cristallini sampling method through ASTM, in particular for defining an additional uncertainty component to account for the sampling process and the subsequent sample preparation, which would have to be attributed in the future to all isotopic measurements on samples taken by the Cristallini sampling method.

40|$|The {{moisture}} transport in capillary-porous {{building materials}} {{is governed by}} their microstructure. This thesis describes the calculation of hygric material properties from three-dimensional representations of the building materials' microstructures using finite element methods. The moisture transport processes considered comprise the water permeation, the water diffusion and the capillary absorption. Three hardened cement pastes with two different water to cement ratios, and two sandstones, a Fontainebleau and a Bentheimer sandstone serve as examples of capillary-porous materials. The basis of the calculations are microtomographic images (µCT) of the hardened cement pastes and the sandstones, as well as microstructures of the hardened cement pastes generated with the simulation software CEMHYD 3 D. To what extend the latter are realistic is investigated by comparing the fractal dimension and the autocorrelation function of the pore spaces of the simulated microstructures {{as well as their}} pore space distribution with the corresponding values of the µCT images. In order to simulate the different moisture transport processes the medial axis of the pore spaces of the microstructures is first extracted. Afterwards the medial axis is converted into a transportation network, consisting of cylindrical tubes, which possesses the same moisture transport properties as the original pore space. In case of permeability Bernoulli's law is applied to every <b>tube</b> in the <b>transportation</b> network. An arbitrary pressure difference of 1 bar is imposed between the inlet and the outlet surface of the network and the resulting mass flow is calculated by finite element methods. The overall mass flow results from the sum of the mass flows of the tubes traversing the outlet surface. Using Darcy's law the permeability coefficient of the porous medium is derived. The water vapor diffusion is simulated using Fick's first law for every tube {{as well as for the}} mass current density within the porous medium. Between inlet and outlet surface a water vapor concentration difference of 10 % is applied and the water vapor diffusion coefficient of the hardened cement pastes and the sandstones is deduced from the resulting mass flow. Finally the capillary water absorption of the porous media is simulated analogously to the heat conduction. The individual tubes of the network are replaced by one-dimensional heat conducting elements. The temperature conduction coefficients of the elements and the boundary conditions are adjusted so that the time needed for the heat flow to traverse an element is equivalent to the time required by the water front during the capillary water uptake. The water absorption coefficients of the materials contemplated are then obtained from the amount of absorpted water at each time step of the finite element calculation. The validation of the presented model is accomplished by comparing the simulated moisture transportation coefficients with experimental values...|$|R
