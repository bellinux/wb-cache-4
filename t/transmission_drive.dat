40|$|In the {{previous}} chapters, {{the behavior of}} beams subjected to axial and transverse loads is studied in detail. In chapter 6, a fairly general, three dimensional loading is considered, with one important restriction: the beam is assumed to bend without twisting.

Power <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> shafts are {{a prime example of}} structural components designed to carry a specific torque. Such components are designed with solid or thinwalled circular cross-sections. Numerous other structural components are designed to carry a combination of axial, bending, and torsional loads.

Traction elements compatible with sterilization and Mars surface environmental constraints were designed and are compatible with the rover mass, range and stowage requirements of JPL's point design Mars rover. In order to save cost, the loopwheel suspensions for the demonstration model were made of S-glass/epoxy instead of titanium, alloy specified for flight units.

40|$|Wire capstan drives {{are used}} as rotary {{transmission}} elements for their very low (nominally zero) backlash and high stiffness properties. To obtain high stiffness, the cable is typically wrapped around the input and output drum in a figure-eight pattern multiple times. This stiffness can be determined by analyzing the amount of deformation between the cable and the drums and the friction caused by this contact. In product literature and various textbooks [1][2][3], it was noticed that different methods of determining the stiffness of the <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> were presented depending how friction was considered. It is found the model which considers the extension from the external torque and preload force matches experimental data {{along with the other}} model that defined the area of traction to act in a certain section of the drum. As the coefficient of friction between the cable and transmission drum increases, the two models differ giving the method that defined the area of slip along a certain section of the drum, the conservative choice. This paper presents a comparison of two different stiffness models, along with data from experiments to study the model differences.

40|$|B {{chromosomes}} are elements {{extra to}} the standard (A) chromosomes. Their frequencies in populations are determined by their transmission rates and effects on host fitness. Most B chromosomes {{are considered to be}} genomic parasites having <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> and being detrimental to their carriers. In some populations of the hermaphroditic planarian Polycelis nigra a small metacentric B chromosome is very abundant. These populations are pseudogamous parthenogenetic, meaning that sperm is needed to activate egg development, but sperm chromosomes are eliminated from the egg after fertilization. Previous transmission studies have shown that paternally inherited B chromosomes occasionally escape expulsion from the egg. Here, we compared a number of phenotypic fitness aspects of worms, with and without B chromosomes, taken from the field. B chromosomes did not significantly affect adult body size, cocoon fertility, cocoon size, hatching time and number of young per cocoon. In one of three samples cocoon production decreased significantly with increasing B number. In one of two populations, young from mothers with B chromosomes grew significantly slower than those of mothers without Bs. The dynamics of this B chromosome appear to conform to the parasitic model: Bs accumulate through occasional paternal inheritance despite being selected against through negative effects on cocoon production and juvenile growth. ...|$|E

30|$|Driveline {{efficiency}} {{can significantly}} affect car fuel economy, and studying this relationship through bench and road tests requires long working periods, high costs, and heavy workloads. Such tests {{can also lead}} to certain blindness for the determination of vehicle and various assembly schemes, the selection of structural parameters and the matching of driveline parameters with an engine, all of which can affect the creation of a better matching program, result in an unsatisfactory product performance, and wastage of resources [1]. Therefore, various computer simulation forecasting methods assisted by bench tests have been widely adopted to optimize driveline matching and study transmission efficiency. Such methods can improve design quality, shorten the development cycle, and reduce costs [2]. Numerous studies on the efficiency of CVT and gearbox have been conducted through bench tests in China and abroad. Akehurst et al. [3 – 5] used bench tests to study torque losses in a metal belt CVT, which were caused by the relative sliding motion between belt segments and bands. They then forecasted and studied torque losses between belt segments and bands caused by the bending and deformation of the pulley based on experimental observations of pulley deflections. Furthermore, they studied the sliding speed of belt segments relative to the primary and secondary pulleys and its effects on torque loss, after which they proposed a model for the effects. They validated their proposed model using a number of experimental data. Meanwhile, various transmission power losses of CVT have been analyzed, and the transmission efficiencies of metal belts have been measured through bench tests [6]. However, the effects of CVT efficiency on car fuel economy have not yet been studied through real car tests. Huang et al. [7] conducted a CVT efficiency bench test using an electronically controlled gasoline engine as the power source, in which ratio, torque, and torque transmission ranges with high efficiency were measured. However, they did not validate the results using a real car test. In addition, researchers have investigated the influences of gear precision, bearing fit quality, and gear oil in the gearbox on transmission efficiency. Wang et al. [8] selected manual transmission as the research object to determine the influence of different gear precisions on <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests. The results showed that a high-precision gear with a grinding process could evidently improve <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> efficiency. Gear precision mainly influences mesh precision and transmission dynamic stability. Considerable work has been done to analyze the influence of different types of gear oil on transmission efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests [9 – 11]. Similarly, Zhu et al. [12] studied the power loss of CVTs, including torque loss and speed loss, based on the transmission mechanism of CVTs, and experiments on CVT efficiency were conducted on a specific CVT test bench. Furthermore, they provided optimal structural parameters to serve as references for designing and tuning CVTs.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a novel laser-speckle-based position sensing technique. In our prototype implementation, a He-Ne laser beam is directed at the surface of an air-bearing spindle. An imaging system is set up to capture speckle patterns scattered from the spindle surface. These patterns are highly correlated over small angular displacements of the spindle. We use correlation-based image-processing algorithms to measure offsets between the speckle patterns. These offsets are calibrated against the counts of a commercial incremental optical encoder. A custom-built bicell photointerrupter unit {{is used as a}} reference sensor for the incremental optical encoder. To test for the control performance of this speckle-based sensor, we have constructed a <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> to run the air-bearing spindle. Our speckle-based metrology system is able to run at update rates of 10 Hz with a measured closed loop - 3 dB bandwidth of about 2 Hz. Using a real-time processor interfaced with a desktop PC, we have implemented a novel algorithm that interpolates position estimates with respect to two pre-stored global images. We predict that this technique can potentially achieve resolutions of 0. 1 [mu]m for translational and 5 [mu]rad for rotational motion. The limitation of our current implementation is the low update rates resulting from the time-intensive nature of correlation-based methods. Possible methods to overcome this limitation are addressed and ideas for follow-on work are presented. by Vijay Shilpiekandula. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{vehicle drive}} shaft {{is one of}} the most {{important}} component. It transmits torque from the engine to the differential gear of a rear wheel drive vehicle. Generally the drive shaft is made up of steel alloy but the use of conventional steel has disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength and high weight. Nowadays this steel drive shaft is replaced by composite material drive shaft. This advanced composite such as graphite, Kevlar, carbon, glass with suitable resin have advantage of higher specific strength, less weight, high damping capacity, longer life, high critical speed and greater torque carrying capacity and can results in considerable amount of weight reduction as compared to steel shaft. The main objective of this research work is to study the structural and vibrational behavior of composite material drive shaft assembly as compared to conventional steel drive shaft. Heavy duty vehicle <b>transmission</b> <b>drive</b> shaft has been used for the project. The conventional material steel SM 45 C and three composite materials HS carbon epoxy, E-glass epoxy, HM carbon epoxy have been used for drive shaft study so as to determine the suitable composite replacement in order to optimize the performance and design. The drive shaft was modelled using the CREO 3. 0 cad software and finite element analysis were done using ansys 14. 0 FEA as an analysis tool for numerical simulation to find the dynamic vibration response of composite material drive.
