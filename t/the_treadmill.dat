They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. <b>The</b> <b>treadmill,</b> which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running.

40|$|We have {{determined}} <b>the</b> <b>treadmilling</b> rate of brain microtubules (MTs) free of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) at polymer mass steady state in vitro by using [3 H]GTP-exchange. We developed buffer conditions that suppressed dynamic instability behavior by ≈ 10 -fold {{to minimize the}} contribution of dynamic instability to total tubulin-GTP exchange. <b>The</b> MTs <b>treadmilled</b> rapidly under <b>the</b> suppressed dynamic instability conditions, at a minimum rate of 0. 2 μm/min. Thus, rapid treadmilling is an intrinsic property of MAP-free MTs. Further, we show that tau, an axonal stabilizing MAP involved in Alzheimer’s disease, strongly suppresses <b>the</b> <b>treadmilling</b> rate. These results indicate that tau’s function in axons might involve suppression of axonal MT treadmilling. We describe mathematically how treadmilling and dynamic instability are mechanistically distinct MT behaviors. Finally, we present a model that explains how small changes in the critical tubulin subunit concentration at MT minus ends, caused by intrinsic differences in rate constants or regulatory proteins, could produce large changes in <b>the</b> <b>treadmilling</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Design of a health/fitness {{facility}} {{is a crucial}} element in managing risks to its operators, users and others. Improper location of treadmills not compliant with industry recommendations can {{increase the risk of}} injuries, adverse events and subsequent legal liability for health/fitness facility operators. The aim of our study was to analyse the location (spacing and placement) of treadmills in health/fitness facilities in Australia. Methods: An on-site observational audit was conducted at regional and metropolitan health/fitness facilities (n = 11) in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. The spacing surrounding <b>the</b> <b>treadmills</b> was measured in centimetres (cm). Placement was assessed by the objects within two metres behind <b>the</b> <b>treadmills.</b> Results: In all health/fitness facilities the distances surrounding <b>the</b> <b>treadmills</b> on <b>the</b> sides, and behind were less than the recommended minimum distances (0. 5 - 1 m on the sides, 2 m behind) by the manufacturers. In most of the health/ fitness facilities there was other equipment (60 %, n = 6) within two metres behind <b>the</b> <b>treadmills.</b> Discussion: <b>The</b> findings suggest that most of the health/fitness facilities audited in this study do not comply with industry minimum recommendations on location of treadmills necessary for safe operation. Conclusion: Health/fitness facility operators in Australia should be trained to increase their awareness about the risks associated with improper location of treadmills to take appropriate preventive measures...|$|R

25|$|Bruce and Dr. Harold T. Dodge {{initiated}} the Seattle Heart Watch program in 1971. This program involved community physicians in hospitals, offices, {{and the medical}} department of the Boeing Company. It tested the feasibility, utility and reproducibility of results of symptom-limited exercise testing in ambulatory cardiac patients and apparently healthy subjects. A database of more than 10,000 individuals was developed over the next 10 years. Signals from <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> monitors were sent by dataphone from 15 different test sites to the University Hospital research lab for analysis, and follow-up questionnaires from thousands of patients were accumulated for years. This database was used to develop normal standards based on age, sex and habitual pattern of activity. The duration of exercise became the principal measurement for the estimation of what Bruce termed functional aerobic impairment.|$|E
25|$|A typical gait {{analysis}} laboratory {{has several}} cameras (video and / or infrared) placed around a walkway or a treadmill, which {{are linked to}} a computer. The patient has markers located at various points of reference of the body (e.g., iliac spines of the pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee), or groups of markers applied to half of the body segments. The patient walks down the catwalk or <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> and the computer calculates the trajectory of each marker in three dimensions. A model is applied to calculate {{the movement of the}} underlying bones. This gives a complete breakdown of the movement of each joint. One common method is to use Helen Hayes Hospital marker set, in which a total of 15 markers are attached on the lower body. The 15 marker motions are analyzed analytically, and it provides angular motion of each joint.|$|E
25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough for the purposes of <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E

25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the association of cortisol levels to exertional perception and exercise induced changes in affect during a bout of exercise. It was expected that increased levels of salivary cortisol would be associated with a negative shift in affect in response to a submaximal and maximal treadmill test. It was also hypothesized that increased levels of salivary cortisol levels would be associated with an increased perception of exertion during a submaximal and maximal treadmill test. Males and females between 27 and 35 years of age (n= 33) were recruited to participate in this study. Salivary cortisol was assessed at baseline, 5 minutes after <b>the</b> submaximal <b>treadmill</b> test, 5 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test, and 30 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test. Affect was measured using the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score of the Profile of Mood Scale (POMS). The greater the TMD scores, the more negative the mood. Affect was measured at baseline, 5 minutes after <b>the</b> submaximal <b>treadmill</b> test, 5 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test, and 30 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test. Perceived exertion (RPE) was measured using the OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion. Final RPE for legs, chest and breathing, and overall body was assessed during the final minute of <b>the</b> submaximal <b>treadmill</b> test, and immediately at the end of <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test. Session RPE was assessed 5 minutes after the cessation of both the submaximal and maximal treadmill test. Partial correlations were conducted to examine the association between cortisol values, affect, and RPE. Results indicated there was a positive correlation between cortisol values and negative affect. This association was found only in males and the correlation was strongest in both the change in cortisol levels from baseline to 5 minutes and 30 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test and <b>the</b> change in affect from baseline to 5 minutes after <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test. Final RPE assessed for <b>the</b> maximal <b>treadmill</b> test was positively correlated with cortisol levels 30 minutes after maximal treadmill test. This correlation was found only in females. There appears to be evidence that increased cortisol levels post exercise are associated with a negative mood shift following a maximal treadmill test and higher perceived exertion during a maximal treadmill test. Future examination of the association among cortisol levels, affect, and perceived exertion during exercise is warranted. Examining the physiological and psychological responses to exercise may assist with the development of better strategies that will help increase exercise adaptation and adherence...|$|R
