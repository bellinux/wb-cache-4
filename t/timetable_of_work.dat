40|$|Constructing <b>timetables</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for {{personnel}} in healthcare institutions {{is a highly}} constrained and di#cult problem to solve. In this chapter, we will present an overview of our development of the algorithms that underpin a commercial nurse rostering decision support system that is in use in over 40 hospitals in Belgium. As such, we are particularly concerned {{with the real world}} regulations and requirements of Belgian institutions. We have concentrated upon short term rostering which involves assigning tasks to nurses in a hospital ward. Of course, the over-riding requirement of our algorithms is to assure a permanent level of care for the patients. However, our approaches are also required to consider administrative requirements, the nurses' contracts and their personal preferences...|$|R
40|$|Constructing <b>timetables</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for {{personnel}} in healthcare institutions {{is known to}} be a highly constrained and difficult problem to solve. In this paper, we discuss a commercial system, together with the model it uses, for this rostering problem. We show that tabu search heuristics can be made effective, particularly for obtaining reasonably good solutions quickly for smaller rostering problems. We discuss the robustness issues, which arise in practice, for tabu search heuristics. This paper introduces a range of new memetic approaches for the problem, which use a steepest descent improvement heuristic within a genetic algorithm framework. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the best features of a memetic algorithm for the rostering problem, particularly the nature of an effective recombination operator, and show that these memetic approaches can handle initialisation parameters and a range of instances more robustly than tabu search algorithms, at the expense of longer solution times. Having presented tabu search and memetic approaches (both with benefits and drawbacks) we finally present an algorithm that is a hybrid of both approaches. This technique produces better solutions than either of the earlier approaches and it is relatively unaffected by initialisation and parameter changes, combining some of the best features of each approach to create a hybrid which is greater {{than the sum of its}} component algorithms. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{first thing}} a visitor notices when {{entering}} Hollytree primary {{school is the}} art-work displayed on every wall. This paper, based on a three-year ethnographic study of the school, mobilizes field notes and interview and photographic data to probe the meanings of this visual 'display'. We argue that the walls (re) produce and promote normative meanings of 'good work', the 'good student', the 'good teacher' and the 'good school', which serve {{both internal and external}} purposes. They are also a means of promoting an inclusive culture which, while true of arts activities, may not always be the case in mainstream classes. In addition, the school walls support aspects <b>of</b> the school <b>timetable</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>work,</b> and also constitute resources for children to construct narratives about their collective and individual histories in the school...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{international}} {{research has}} demonstrated a relationship between physical health and occupational status/level of appointment: people who hold higher level positions enjoy better physical health on average than those in lower positions. Researchers have speculated {{that this may be}} in part due to the lower levels of control exercised over pace and <b>timetabling</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by those occupying lower positions. Poorer physical health is thus mediated by lower levels of mental wellbeing. Worldwide, many working in school education have experienced ‘control’ being taken away from them by rapid and constant educational change imposed from ‘the outside’. The pace and extent of change has varied across nations, and it can be predicted that its effects will also vary according to its intensity. The research reported here was conducted in four countries - Australia, New Zealand, England and the United States of America - and employed a sample of more than 2600 teachers and school executives at over 360 primary and secondary schools. Context - in this case, country - was found to be the most powerful predictor of overall career satisfaction, change in satisfaction and mental health, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire. This result is discussed in the light of levels of educational change experienced at each of the four sites. The level of position an individual held and type <b>of</b> school they <b>worked</b> in were found to be related to his/her satisfaction and mental wellbeing in some contexts, but not others. In this paper, we explore the reasons for these relationships, using insights gained from the general research on occupational status and health...|$|R

The computer model of foundry has been planed and conducted in order to compile the schedule of cast production. The variants of solution have been estimated talking into account time limitations imposed by clients and the criterion for prime costs appointed {{on the basis of the}} ZAR by means of aided detailed calculation according to planes of their formation. In the research, problem connected with exploitation of automatic foundry lines have been taken into consideration. Moreover, the analysis <b>of</b> line <b>work</b> stoppage has been conducted and construction of schedule of the planned service of line device has been undertaken on the basis of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>timetables</b> <b>of</b> correct <b>work</b> <b>of</b> these devices. Furthermore, the operational database has been prepared so as to assemble and process data about the damaged and other line work stoppage. It should be noted that the database will give the possibility of working out the schedule of planned service. The problems has been presented by using the pocket for modelling and the simulation of productive systems – AREN...|$|R
2500|$|Mostly, {{except in}} the early years, there were no proper {{passenger}} trains but a passenger coach attached to a goods train (forming the so-called [...] "mixed train"). Since the EKLR had no guard's vans until the 1940s, the passenger coaches performed this function (being independently braked). The obvious disadvantage was that shunting made the passenger <b>timetable</b> a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> fiction. One way of making up time was by not stopping at stations where no passengers were waiting. There is anecdotal evidence that sometimes train crews ignored prospective passengers anyway if no goods traffic was to be handled at that stop.|$|R
