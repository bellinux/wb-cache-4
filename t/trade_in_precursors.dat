40|$|Oceania, {{most notably}} Australia and New Zealand, {{has emerged as}} the region with the highest rate of {{consumption}} of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), including ecstasy, a disproportionately large share in relation to the population in the area. The illicit ATS <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> Oceania is of great concern to contemporary criminal justice and poses an imminent challenge to law enforcement agencies, governments, and the international community. This study examines the market for ATS in Oceania including Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, and the involvement of criminal organisations in that market. It explores contemporary patterns of ATS production, trafficking, and demand in the region, analyses the involvement of organised crime, and reviews current legislative frameworks - domestic and international - to penalise activities in the illicit ATS market, especially those relating to organised crime activities. The study focuses on the production, trafficking, importation, and consumption of ATS in Oceania, and is limited to synthetic drugs that are commonly classified as amphetamine-type stimulants, including amphetamine, methylamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, and MDEA. The study also covers <b>precursor</b> chemicals used <b>in</b> the manufacturing of ATS. Part one analyses current levels of production of ATS in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, the availability of and illicit <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> ATS <b>precursors,</b> the market factors of ATS production, and organised crime involvement in ATS production and precursor trading. The second part outlines contemporary patterns and levels of ATS trafficking and importation in Oceania, market factors, and organised crime involvement. Part three identifies current prevalence of ATS consumption in the region and examines the retail market and retail prices for these substances. The fourth part analyses existing domestic and international legal frameworks relevant to the criminalisation of the illicit, commercial ATS and ATS-precursor trade. This part outlines and examines relevant provisions under international legal instruments, their implementation into domestic laws of the countries in the region, and other relevant penal provisions under domestic law. The study concludes by highlighting some key indicators of the ATS <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> Oceania and developing a set of basic suggestions for policy change and law reform...|$|R

The process is relatively straightforward and the underlying fundamental aspects, such as phase formation sequence and reaction rates, have been studied intensively.

Next, it tries to find out if foreign direct investment plays a role in the import and export behavior of East Asian intra-regional trade. Using a gravity model, it evidences that in general FDI is important in explaining imports and exports of intra-East Asian <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> particular, FDI is especially important <b>in</b> explaining <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts, followed by <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> capital goods.
