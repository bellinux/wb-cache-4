The photo shows the lower-left corner of the clay tablet letter, but what is of interest is the isolated cuneiform characters next to the [...] "double-scribed paragraph lines". The characters before the paragraph lines show {{the last line of}} Para III (an VIII paragraph letter). The (3) characters shown are [...] "la ta-pa-". The adjoining piece has the rest of the spelling of the words, making the line: [...] "lā parāšu", for Not Ceasing, or [...] "Not Interrupting". In English, parāsu means to separate, to cut, or to decide. The la is Akkadian [...] "lā", for English [...] "not". But the reason the verb is spelled across the entire line (EA 26, line 29), is that the subject of Para III concerns the history of [...] "diplomatic missions" [...] coming and going, between Tushratta's Mittani, and the Pharaoh's Egypt. The last line culminates the paragraph, by saying: ...." [...] (the missions), (l. 29) Not, Ceasing! (not being interrupted as commonplace, previously) The verb form is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing,</b> a form of a superlative; a similar last-line occurs in EA 19, Para II.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{review the}} {{personality}} construct and its disorders {{according to the}} categorical and dimensional approaches, and the present understanding of dementia and its risk factors. This study shows a relationship between pre-morbid personality and risk of developing dementia. Data with speculative character, and indirect proofs from studies on life style, habits and pathological behaviors are reported. Categorical and dimensional parameters of personality are studied respectively by cluster analysis of the DSM classification, and by two contributive instruments: the Cloninger's temperament and character inventory (TCI) with seven dimensions, and the Costa and McCrae's NEO personality inventory (NEO PI) with five factors. Risk of dementia is higher in patients with the DSM C personality cluster, and, by order of severity, the dependent, avoidant and obsessive types of personality. According to the TCI, these three personality types have a high score on the dimension "harm avoidance", which {{increases the risk of}} dementia. With the five factor model investigated by the NEO PI, the risk of dementia is increased by low levels of extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscienciousness, and high level of neuroticism. Biological correlations are mixed up with these two personality models, which have coherent correlations between their respective dimensions. High levels of neuroticism and harm avoidance are associated with low serotonin activity, deficient neuroplasticity, cortisol abnormalities and greater deleterious impact according to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing</b> situations. Cortisol levels regulation differs according to the type of personality and cortisol axis dysregulation could play a key part in dementia occurrence. Detecting vulnerable personalities should lead to recommendations for dementia prevention...|$|E
40|$|We {{have applied}} {{solutions}} with varying osmotic pressures symmetrically {{to the inside}} and outside of perfused, TTX-treated, giant axons. The potassium conductance G decreased with increasing osmotic stress, but there was no effect on either the shape or the position of the voltage-current curve. One must distinguish three possible actions of the osmotic agent: osmotic stress, channel blocking, and lowered solution conductivity. To do so, we compared results obtained working with pairs of internal and external solutions of either (a) equal osmotic stress, (b) equal conductivity, or (c) the same blocking agent. There was the same change in G irrespective of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing</b> species (sorbitol or sucrose); this provides some evidence against a blocking mechanism. The conductivity of the external solution had a small effect on K currents; internal solution conductivity had none. A change in series resistance of the Schwann cell layer could account for the small effect of external solution conductivity. The primary cause of G depression appears, then, to be the applied osmotic stress. Using this result, we have developed models in which the channel has a transition between closed states under voltage control but osmotically insensitive and a closed/open step that is voltage-independent but osmotically sensitive. We have assumed that the conductance of this open state does not change with osmotic stress. In this way, we estimate that an additional 1, 350 +/- 200 A 3 or 40 - 50 molecules of solute-inaccessible water appear to associate with the average delayed rectifier potassium channel of the squid axon when it opens...|$|E

He {{describes}} that some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> are actually useful because they boost learning. It’s hard to differentiate whether someone is experiencing stress by their physiological responses. When you are aroused the physiological state resembles both stress and pleasure. So, Jeansok Kim and David Diamond {{came up with a}} three part measurement and definition that helps identify if someone is stressed. There must be an aroused physiological response that others can recognize and measure. The second part is that the stressor must be seen as unpleasant. The third part is that the person must feel out of control, {{when it comes to the}} stressor. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> that contain these components, are measurable in a lab setting are the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> Medina refers to.|$|R

40|$|Pancreatic beta-cells {{exposed to}} high glucose {{concentrations}} display altered gene expression, function, survival and growth that {{may contribute to}} the slow deterioration of the functional beta-cell mass in type 2 diabetes. These glucotoxic alterations may result from various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> imposed by the hyperglycaemic environment, including oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, cytokine-induced apoptosis and hypoxia. The glucose regulation of oxidative stress-response and integrated stress-response genes in cultured rat islets follows an asymmetric V-shaped profile parallel to that of beta-cell apoptosis, with a large increase at low glucose and a moderate increase at high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations. These observations suggest that both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> could {{play a role in the}} alteration of the functional beta-cell mass under states of prolonged hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. In addition, beta-cell demise under glucotoxic conditions may also result from beta-cell hypoxia and, in vivo, from their exposure to inflammatory cytokines released locally by non-endocrine islet cells. A better understanding of the relative contribution <b>of</b> each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> to beta-cell glucotoxicity and of their pathophysiological cause in vivo may lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent the slow deterioration of the functional beta-cell mass in glucose intolerant and type 2 diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Cost estimators play an {{important}} role in an organization, as they produce the majority of predictions of probable final construction cost. Care is needed as both under and overestimates can be costly. The nature of the task is also such that the work has to be done in a restricted amount of time. It is likely, therefore, that the people involved are likely to experience a considerable amount of mental and emotional stress as a result. <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> can be divided into objective stress (OS), occurring as a result of events experienced, and subjective stress (SS) and emotional exhaustion (EE), which are a function of the demands of the situation created by those events.
