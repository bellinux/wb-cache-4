5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to <b>testify</b> against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to <b>testify,</b> the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to <b>testify</b> first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
