5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with <b>the</b> <b>pups.</b> Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} {{may occur}} during labour due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are delivered at an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access}} to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
5000|$|Jerry sees {{a sack of}} puppies {{thrown into}} a nearby river and rescues them. Most of them run away, but a very {{friendly}} and energetic puppy licks Jerry and attempts to follow him home. Jerry tries to scare <b>the</b> <b>pup,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> follows him. Jerry then grabs a stick and pretends to play fetch with <b>the</b> <b>pup.</b> However, Jerry accidentally throws the stick into the river, which results <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> hanging on <b>the</b> side of the hill. The puppy whines in fear and almost falls into the river. Jerry saves him and lets him in. <b>The</b> <b>pup</b> drinks an asleep Tom's milk and Jerry hides him, pretending he did it. Tom chases Jerry, but soon sees <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> is drinking his milk. Tom cannot stop <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> drinking his milk, and when Tom picks up <b>the</b> <b>pup,</b> <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> licks him, much to Tom's annoyance.|$|R
50|$|Tom puts <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> outside, but Jerry scoops him up {{and puts}} him inside a drawer. However, <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> {{immediately}} escapes and sleeps on Tom's bed, taking the cat's blanket. Tom takes the blanket and throws <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> outside, where <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> falls into a bottle. Jerry pulls <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> out by <b>the</b> waist using windowsill string and again gets licked, but is met by Tom soon after, who also gets licked.|$|R
50|$|A small jungle {{bush dog}} pup that Hugo and Rita {{encounter}} in the third movie. Rita discovers <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> when she hides in a hollow log near the Jungle Dog's nest area. <b>The</b> <b>pup</b> mistakes Rita for its mother and Rita (presuming <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> was abandoned by its real mother) takes it under her wing. Before the movie's release, some fans mistook <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> to be Hugo and Rita's child.|$|R
5|$|The mothers {{raise their}} young without aid from adult males. When <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are {{about two months}} old and their coats grow in, their mother {{introduces}} them to the water. Otters are natural swimmers and, with parental supervision, they acquire {{the skills necessary to}} swim.|$|E
5|$|Upon their return, the Starks find a dead stag, sigil (seal) of House Baratheon. A bit farther {{they find}} a dead dire wolf and her {{surviving}} pups. Noting that the dire wolf is the sigil of the Stark family and {{there are as many}} pups as the Stark children (even an albino runt for Jon), they take <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> in as companions.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped feeding <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> after Thanksgiving {{that same}} year. Though <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> System {{is known}} for its {{distance}} learning education programs. The Open University System is conceptualized as a [...] "university within a university". It is composed of <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> Institute of Open and Distance Education/Transnational Education, PUP Institute of Non-Traditional Studies Program and ETEEAP, and <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> Center for Continuing and Professional Development. <b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> OU System is also known as the [...] "Pamantasang Bayan" [...] and established in the 1970s which offers vocational courses.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the last}} entry {{featuring}} the second Pete <b>the</b> <b>Pup.</b> His trainer was fired from Hal Roach studios. Other unrelated dogs aired as Pete <b>the</b> <b>Pup</b> until 1938.|$|R
5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be {{impregnated}} by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of the}} series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate {{is related to the}} wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Pollard {{broke away}} from <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> and formed <b>the</b> Christian Democratic Party of Belize (CDP). The CDP contested the 1961 elections, but <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> won all 18 seats.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> {{was founded}} in 1950 as an anti-colonial party while the country was ruled by the United Kingdom as British Honduras. Under George Cadle Price <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> {{played a major role}} in {{negotiating}} Belize's self-government in 1964 and eventual independence in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> dominated local British Honduran and later Belizean politics from the mid-1950s until 1984, when it lost to the centre-right opposition United Democratic Party (UDP). The UDP has been the party's main opposition since the early 1970s. Under Price's leadership, <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> returned to power in 1989 but was defeated by the UDP again in 1993.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> Sto. Tomas Gymnasium {{is where}} all the P.E. classes are held. It also serves as the event center of <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> Santo Tomas {{community}} and other neighboring institutions in Santo Tomas.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|Although OR-7 was {{the first}} gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since {{migrated}} to Siskiyou County, {{just south of the}} Oregon–California border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a photo of the Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The breeding pair came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups from a second pack, the Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce <b>the</b> <b>pups,</b> the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack breeding pair with a tracking collar.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>PUP's</b> {{defeat in}} <b>the</b> 2008 election, Musa and Fonseca {{announced}} that they were resigning from their leadership positions. Musa said that <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> needed to [...] "renew itself from the top." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Goldson {{resigned}} from <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> along with nine others, citing Price's ambitious moves {{within the party}} hierarchy. Goldson would serve {{the rest of his}} political career in opposition to Price and <b>the</b> <b>PUP.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pup</b> was a single-seat {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} with an Ava flat-four pusher engine {{mounted on the}} wing trailing edge. The wings could be folded back for storage. <b>The</b> <b>Pup</b> registered G-AELR first flew in July 1936.|$|R
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and <b>the</b> <b>pups,</b> which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off <b>the</b> <b>pups.</b> Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E
5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
50|$|On August 30, 2016, Taliaferro {{was placed}} on <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> list to start the 2016 season. He was {{activated}} from <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> list on October 22, 2016. He {{was placed on}} injured reserve on December 13, 2016.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pup</b> saw {{extensive}} {{use as a}} trainer. Student pilots completing basic flight training in the Avro 504k often graduated to <b>the</b> <b>Pup</b> as an intermediate trainer. <b>The</b> <b>Pup</b> was also used in Fighting School units for instruction in combat techniques. Many training Pups were in fact reserved by senior officers and instructors as their personal runabouts while a few survived in France as personal or squadron 'hacks' after the type was withdrawn from combat.|$|R
50|$|Musa {{took over}} {{leadership}} of <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> upon Price's retirement from party leadership in 1996, defeating Price's longtime lieutenant Florencio Marin {{in the leadership}} election. Musa then led <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> to landslide election victories in 1998 and 2003.|$|R
5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters decided to take <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> {{for much}} of the 1980s was heavily divided and out of ideas, {{characterized}} by intra-party fights such as the 1983 national convention in which Said Musa challenged Louis Sylvester, or occasional disputes between the so-called [...] "left wing" [...] of Shoman and Musa and the [...] "right wing" [...] of Sylvester, Ralph Fonseca and persons considered to be the chief financiers of <b>the</b> <b>PUP.</b> In 1986, Musa won the chairmanship position and began recruiting new faces into the party. The immediate result of this was improvement in municipal elections in the late 1980s and a close general election victory in 1989. In its first post-independence term <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> hardly shied away from the same economic policy the UDP had utilized, involving economic growth by improving services. An early election in 1993 cost <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> a chance to stay in power; a victorious alliance of the UDP and National Alliance for Belizean Rights forced <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> to become <b>the</b> opposition party for a second time. The party lost the 1993 elections despite polling more votes overall than <b>the</b> UDP. <b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> had only been outpolled in popular votes previously in 1984. <b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> did internal repairs to the party hierarchy at national conventions in May 1994 and November 1996; the latter saw the resignation of George Price as party leader. Said Musa defeated Florencio Marin Sr. in the ensuing convention to name a new leader. After winning municipal votes in 1996 and 1997 and the general elections in 1998, <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> were riding high once again.|$|R
50|$|Tom chases Jerry, {{carrying}} <b>the</b> <b>pup,</b> around <b>the</b> kitchen, {{until he}} trips {{them up with}} a sponge and they careen out the door. Tom goes to sleep, but then he feels bad over the way he mercilessly kicked out <b>the</b> mouse and <b>pup</b> as a thunderstorm hits. His conscience starts pricking him and he imagines both Jerry and <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> being washed away in the flood. A worried Tom ventures out in the thunderstorm to find Jerry and <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> (who are both safely sleeping together in a drain using a newspaper as a blanket) but he himself gets blown away by the wind and nearly drowns in the river. Jerry and <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> come to Tom's rescue and drag Tom out of the river.|$|R
50|$|The colonial {{administration}} and the National Party, which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of <b>the</b> <b>PUP,</b> however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The governor and the National Party failed {{in their attempts to}} discredit <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> on <b>the</b> issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of President Jacobo Arbenz. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism—a vote for <b>the</b> <b>PUP</b> was a vote in favor of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. <b>The</b> <b>PUP</b> gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda.|$|R
