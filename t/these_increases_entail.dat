40|$|The {{influence}} of different environmental factors on growth and pigment biosynthesis by particular strains of purple thiobacteria was investigated. These strains {{belong to the}} genus Chromatium, Thiocystis, Thiocapsa and Lamprocystis and were isolated from Yavoriv sulphur mine. Calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron and sodium chloride {{should be included in}} the medium for optimal growth of these bacteria. Addition of <b>these</b> elements <b>entails</b> <b>increasing</b> the biomass production and synthesis of carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll a. Initial concentration of inoculum and electron donor has essential influence on growth of purple thiobacteria. Early in the development of culture, sulphide was oxidized, and then the growth impairment and destruction of cells under exposure of light were observed. For the optimization of bacteria growth the electron donor (sulphide) must be added many times during the cultivation process in the concentration, which is not exceed an inhibition dose. The additional bringing of the electron donor in the medium promotes the raise of cells’ biomass. The acetate introduction in the medium has positive influence on the pigments’ biosynthesis. The essential factor of growth and pigments’ biosynthesis is the light intensity. Peak gain of the culture growth was observed under 400 lx. The amplification of light exposure is accompanied by the decrease of growth and content of pigments in cells. Oxygen inhibits the synthesis of pigments in all strain...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{economic}} viability of small-scale, multi-generation systems (combined heat and power (CHP), combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP)), along with conventional {{heating and cooling}} systems combining sixteen heating/cooling energy generation systems (H/C-EGSs). The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EBPD) comparative framework methodology is followed. The local cost-optimal solution for an office building, in Helsinki, Finland is determined for each H/C-EGS {{as well as the}} global cost-optimum. The suggested energy efficiency measures get 144 building combinations, and alongside the H/C-EGSs, altogether 2304 cases. The results show that the global cost-optimum belongs to the ground source heat pump with free ground cooling. The investigated biomass-based CHPs are economically viable only with high overall efficiency and low power-to-heat ratio due to both low investment and operational costs. The biomass-based CCHPs do not have economic or environmental benefits over the biomass-based CHPs due to the significant <b>increase</b> <b>entailed</b> of both investment and operational costs. The fossil fuel-based CHPs with high operational costs are the worst solutions economically and environmentally.

40|$|Jurkat T cells, {{loaded with}} the {{fluorescent}} calcium probe Indo 1, responded to exogenous phosphatidic acid (PA) by transiently increasing their cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. This effect was dose-dependent, remained unmodified when external Ca 2 + was chelated with EGTA, and was totally inhibited when cells were first exposed to CD 3 monoclonal antibodies, indicating {{that it was}} solely due {{to the release of}} an intracellular pool, which is also mobilized during a stimulation via the CD 3 T-cell receptor (TcR) molecular complex. CD 3 - and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated Jurkat cells also produced PA, the dose-responses and kinetics of which were consistent with those of calcium release. Moreover, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase inhibitors abrogated PA production and lowered calcium release by CD 3 -stimulated cells. PA did not induce any apparent increase in inositol triphosphates (IP 3), nor did it modify the <b>increase</b> <b>entailed</b> by activation of the CD 3 pathway, pointing out that IP 3 can be supplemented in mobilizing calcium from intracellular stores. Conversely, a first exposure to PA only partially inhibited the CD 3 - or ionomycin-induced internal release of calcium, suggesting either a rapid restoration of the PA-sensitive stores, or a contribution of other mediators, such as IP 3, in the CD 3 activation pathway...|$|R

40|$|Background Posttranslational {{modifications}} of beta amyloid (Aβ) {{have been shown}} to affect its biophysical and neurophysiological properties. One of these modifications is N-terminal pyroglutamate (pE) formation. Enzymatic glutaminyl cyclase (QC) activity catalyzes cyclization of truncated Aβ(3 -x), generating pE 3 -Aβ. Compared to unmodified Aβ, pE 3 -Aβ is more hydrophobic and neurotoxic. In addition, it accelerates aggregation of other Aβ species. To directly investigate pE 3 -Aβ formation and toxicity in vivo, transgenic (tg) ETNA (E at the truncated N-terminus of Aβ) mice expressing truncated human Aβ(3 – 42) were generated and comprehensively characterized. To further investigate the role of QC in pE 3 -Aβ formation in vivo, ETNA mice were intercrossed with tg mice overexpressing human QC (hQC) to generate double tg ETNA-hQC mice. Results Expression of truncated Aβ(3 – 42) was detected mainly in the lateral striatum of ETNA mice, leading to progressive accumulation of pE 3 -Aβ. This ultimately resulted in astrocytosis, loss of DARPP- 32 immunoreactivity, and neuronal loss at the sites of pE 3 -Aβ formation. Neuropathology in ETNA mice was associated with behavioral alterations. In particular, hyperactivity and impaired acoustic sensorimotor gating were detected. Double tg ETNA-hQC mice showed similar Aβ levels and expression sites, while pE 3 -Aβ were significantly <b>increased,</b> <b>entailing</b> <b>increased</b> astrocytosis and neuronal loss. Conclusions ETNA and ETNA-hQC mice represent novel mouse models for QC-mediated toxicity of truncated and pE-modified Aβ. Due to their significant striatal neurodegeneration these mice can also be used for analysis of striatal regulation of basal locomotor activity and sensorimotor gating, and possibly for DARPP- 32 -dependent neurophysiology and neuropathology. The spatio-temporal correlation of pE 3 -Aβ and neuropathology strongly argues for an important role of this Aβ species in neurodegenerative processes in these models...|$|R
