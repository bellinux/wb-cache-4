5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words. Their children, the grandchildren of the elders, understand very little Wagiman and speak none. Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on <b>the</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> English, is the lingua franca of the area. All members of the Wagiman ethnic group, {{as well as all}} other ethnic groups represented in the area, are native speakers of a moderate grade of Kriol.|$|E
5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on <b>the</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Considering {{the need}} for {{metadata}} standards suitable for the Seman-tic Web, this paper describes the RDA Element Sets and the RDA Value Vo-cabularies that were created from attributes and relationships defined in Re-source Description and Access (RDA). First, we present <b>the</b> <b>vocabularies</b> in-cluded in RDA Element Sets: <b>the</b> <b>vocabularies</b> <b>of</b> classes, of properties and of properties unconstrained by FRBR entities; and then we present <b>the</b> RDA Value <b>Vocabularies,</b> which are under development. As a conclusion, we highlight that these vocabularies {{can be used to}} meet the needs of different contexts due to the unconstrained properties and to <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vocabularies</b> <b>of</b> proper-ties from <b>the</b> <b>vocabularies</b> <b>of</b> values and vice versa...|$|R

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as <b>the</b> <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
