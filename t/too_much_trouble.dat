During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing it will be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which {{have yet to be}} discovered.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{rallied to}} the cause of the boy Emperor Hàm Nghithe fourth monarch in little over a yearafter an {{abortive}} royal uprising at Huế in 1885. Thuyet and fellow regent Nguyễn Văn Tường had enthroned Hiệp Hòa after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution. The teenage Kiến Phúc ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother Học Phione of Tự Đức's wiveswhom he caught having intercourse with Tuong. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> and had to be disposed of.|$|E

25|$|The flugelhorn {{is built}} in the same B pitch as many {{trumpets}} and cornets. It usually has three piston valves and employs the same fingering system as other brass instruments, but four-piston valve and rotary valve variants also exist. It can thus be played without <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> by trumpet and cornet players, though some adaptation to their playing style may be needed. It is usually played with a more deeply conical mouthpiece than either trumpets or cornets (though not as conical as a horn mouthpiece).|$|E

Shearer was asked if he {{wanted to be in the}} series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble.</b> He felt voice acting was [...] "not a lot of fun" [...] because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He was told that the actors would record their lines together and after three calls, executive producer James L. Brooks managed to convince Shearer to join the cast. Shearer's first impression of The Simpsons was that it was funny.

500|$|Burnside {{offered to}} resign his {{commission}} altogether but Lincoln declined, stating {{that there could}} still {{be a place for}} him in the army. Thus, he was placed back {{at the head of the}} IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> there. However, antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding [...] "the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration" [...] in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that [...] "any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines".|$|E

This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ...

I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise.

500|$|Allen and May's {{first series}} in control {{resulted}} in a 3–2 win over South Africa. In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2–1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed {{for the inclusion of}} Cyril Washbrook, who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years. The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes, a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, Fred Trueman, to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place. Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, David Sheppard, who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94. The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: [...] "I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [...] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> for them." [...] Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series. Allen denied any involvement. During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.|$|E

The name of Ganlesse she {{did not seem to}} recollect--that of Alice rendered her hysterical--that of Bridgenorth, furious. She numbered up the various services she had rendered in the family--and denounced the plague of swartness to the linen--of leanness to the poultry--of dearth and dishonour to the housekeeping--and of lingering sickness and early death to Alice;--all which evils, she averred, had only been kept off by her continued, watchful, and incessant cares.--Then again turning to the subject of the fugitive Lance, she expressed such a total contempt of that mean-spirited fellow, in a tone between laughing and crying, as satisfied Julian it was not a topic likely to act as a sedative; and that, therefore, unless he made a longer stay than the urgent state of his affairs permitted, he was not likely to find Mistress Deborah in such a state of composure as might enable him to obtain from her any rational or useful information.|$|R

Surprisingly Bochum did not have to sell key players and could even afford some relatively spectacular transfers. With the return of former key players Paul Freier and Vahid Hashemian, and the purchase of the talents Daniel Fernandes and Austrian international Christian Fuchs Koller called his team the best team he had at Bochum ever. Nevertheless the club came into relegation troubles and could save itself rather late in the season. At the end Bochum finished 14th in that season. Again many supporters asked during the season for the dismissal of the coach. Especially the release of crowd pleaser Tomasz Zdebel in the winter break caused many frictions with the fans.|$|R
