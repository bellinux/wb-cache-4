Abdullah continued this, warning Malays <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without crutches or {{end up in}} wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E

Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise.

2500|$|Ulsterisation was the British Government's {{policy to}} reduce regular Army troop numbers in Northern Ireland and bring local forces {{into the front}} line.

2500|$|Earlier, in April 1953, Bill Lair was {{appointed}} a {{captain in the}} Royal Thai Police. He then selected 100 out of 2,000 previous trainees for advanced instruction in unconventional warfare in Hua Hin, next to King Bhumibol's palace. This elite group would undergo a further eight months of intensive military training before turning about and schooling a further 300 recruits. One of the first visitors to the new training center was Allen Dulles then Associate Director of the CIA. He would later prevent the camp from being closed. At that time, the unit's focus was repelling a Chinese Communist invasion. Nationalist Chinese troops still threatened to cross the Burmese and Lao borders into mainland China, and in turn the Chinese Communists seemed likely to retaliate with a preemptive incursion.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{illness is}} an occurrence that changes one’s life and generates a need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with it. This {{article is based}} on an empirical study of interviews on people living with different long-term illnesses. The results have shown that the learning process is a complex phenomenon interwoven with life as a whole. The essential meaning of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with long-term illness concerns a movement toward a change of understanding of access to the world. In this movement, in which everyday lives as well as relationships with oneself and others are affected, a continual renegotiation is needed. Texts from existential/lifeworld philosopher, Heidegger and Gadamer, have been used to get a greater understanding of the empirical results. These texts have been analysed with particular focus on learning turning points and the importance of reflection. The results are highlighted under the following themes: Pursuit of balance*the aim of learning, The tense grip*the resistance <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>To</b> <b>live</b> more really*the possibilities of the learning, Distancing*the how of the learning, and The tense of the learning*the whole of the learning. In those learning turning points are present. Knowledge from this study has been used to make a didactic model designed to give caregivers a tool <b>to</b> support patients’ <b>learning.</b> The didactic model is called: The challenge to take charge of life with a long-term illness...|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to be shared firmly among all stakeholders — be they parents, teachers, providers or policymakers-that education begins at birth and that children develop and learn in their very first years, which are critical for socio-emotional development, self-regulation, language development, and initial socialization. Education should not be a narrow concept (like academic training) to be monopolized by the education sector, but is to be understood in a broad sense, necessitating good physical and mental health care and involving <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> be, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together, which comprise the ‘four pillars of learning’ as put forward by the UNESCO Delors Report (1996). At the same time, ‘care’ — as understood as nurture and protection for well-being and warm and responsive relationship — fosters motivation <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and <b>to</b> achievemeaningful <b>learning</b> and later academic success. This suggests the importance of investing in the upgrading of quality — particularly educational quality — of numerous family daycare units and small childcare services.|$|R
5000|$|Flood {{management}} {{does not}} aim at total elimination or control of floods or providing total immunity {{from the effects}} of all magnitudes of floods, which is neither practicable from economic considerations nor even necessary, keeping in view other realities that are faced in the Indian context. Thus, a multi-pronged strategy ranging from modifying the floods by means of structural measures <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the floods by means of other non-structural measures is the goal of flood management. Measures for protection against extreme floods of low frequency are seldom economically feasible. The term [...] "flood management" [...] refers to the provision of a reasonable degree of protection against floods by measures to mitigate the recurring havoc caused by floods. This is what is being done in flood plains of Gandak River in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh which are affected by floods.|$|R

60|$|The same on the psychical plane. We either love too much, or impose {{our will}} too much, are too spiritual or too sensual. There {{is not and}} cannot be any actual norm of human conduct. All depends, first, on the unknown inward need within the very nuclear centers of the {{individual}} himself, and secondly on his circumstance. Some men must be too spiritual, some must be too sensual. Some must be too sympathetic, and some must be too proud. We {{have no desire to}} say what men ought to be. We only wish to say {{there are all kinds of}} ways of being, and there is no such thing as human perfection. No man can be anything more than just himself, in genuine living relation to all his surroundings. But that which I am, when I am myself, will certainly be anathema to those who hate individual integrity, and want to swarm. And that which I, being myself, am in myself, may make the hair bristle with rage on a man who is also himself, but very different from me. Then let it bristle. And if mine bristle back again, then let us, if we must, fly at one another like two enraged men. It is how it should be.
