40|$|A {{human factors}} study {{was carried out}} to assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 <b>tailgating</b> {{behavior}} {{and the effect of}} advisory signs in mitigating <b>tailgating.</b> <b>Tailgating</b> is a dangerous driving behavior and a leading cause of most rear-end crashes. Through a prior study, serious <b>tailgating</b> was identified on urban Rhode Island highways. It is critical to many urban traffic management authorities to understand <b>tailgating</b> and to explore means to mitigate drivers’ <b>tailgating</b> behavior, especially on urban highways with high-speed and high-volume traffic. Properly designed advisory signs could reduce <b>tailgating</b> and related motor crashes. To assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 behavior with regards to <b>tailgating,</b> a questionnaire survey was developed and given to a number of subjects with daily highway driving experience. The survey is designed to identify causes of <b>tailgating</b> and drivers’ perceptions and engagements on <b>tailgating</b> behavior. Drivers 2 ̆ 7 driving behaviors were further assessed through driving simulation under different traffic conditions. To help mitigate <b>tailgating</b> behavior, advisory signs and an educational video were developed. The effectiveness of these proposed countertailgating measures was assessed in the driving simulation. Subjects’ real driving behaviors were further studied in a follow-up field study. Study results found that the majority had an incorrect sense regarding safe following distance and were <b>tailgating</b> while driving on highways. Heavy traffic was identified as the top <b>tailgating</b> cause. The simulation results confirmed the <b>tailgating</b> phenomenon observed on urban Rhode Island highways.

Understanding <b>tailgating</b> and finding means to mitigate <b>tailgating</b> behavior on highways has become a priority to many urban traffic management authorities. A human factors study was conducted to investigate the <b>tailgating</b> issue and possible counter-tailgating measures. The study started with a questionnaire survey and a traffic analysis to assess the causes and effects of <b>tailgating</b> and its impact on urban RI highway traffic. To identify drivers’ perceptions on <b>tailgating</b> behavior, 210 subjects were recruited in the survey. It found that 95 % of participants are potential tailgators and heavy traffic was identified as the top <b>tailgating</b> cause. Vehicle headways on specific urban segments of three major RI highways were next examined in the traffic analysis. It found that over 60 % of vehicles were <b>tailgating</b> during rush hours and about 40 % during non-rush hours. The findings confirmed that serious <b>tailgating</b> exists on urban RI highways. To advise drivers and mitigate their <b>tailgating</b> behaviors, counter-tailgating measures such as advisory signs and an educational video were designed and assessed through a driving simulation experiment. Pronounced effect of advisory signs on limiting <b>tailgating</b> was identified especially after subjects viewing the video. Participants’ driving behaviors were further studied through a field study. The majority found it difficult to maintain a safe following distance in a real driving environment without employing any measures. Based on the results, it is recommended that the proposed counter-tailgating measures be adopted into a more sophisticated <b>tailgating</b> treatment system...|$|R
