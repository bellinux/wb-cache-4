40|$|This article {{develops}} a volatility model based on portfolio theory to examine state <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> variability. Unlike traditional parametric {{methods used to}} analyse state <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> variability, the portfolio approach allows the computation of a tax's share of total <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> that minimizes the overall variability in total state <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> given a state's portfolio of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> sources. The model can thus be used to evaluate how closely a state's revenue portfolio is constructed to minimize variability in total state <b>tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> An empirical application of the model is conducted on a sample of US states. The volatility model presented here serves as a useful complement to parametric techniques {{that have been used}} to estimate <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> variability. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Using {{macroeconomic}} {{factors to}} forecast <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> {{is an important}} means of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> forecasting, {{and it is also}} a challenging issue in China to which State Administration of Taxation pays close attention. As a prerequisite, the relationships among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and certain macroeconomic factors should be examined. In this paper, interactions among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue,</b> GDP, price level, and external trade in China are investigated. With the benefit of cointegration analysis, the long-run equilibrium conditions among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and these macroeconomic factors are proposed. Based on these cointegrating relations, a vector error correction (VEC) model is then estimated. The results show both long-run and short-run relationships among total <b>tax</b> <b>revenue,</b> GDP, price level, and external trade in China, which could help to promote further studies concerning <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> analysis and forecasting using macroeconomic factors...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>revenue</b> {{has been}} a major {{contribution}} to Indonesia’s Government, especially since 2000. Although <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> {{has been a}} main source, in the implementation there are several problems are tax ratio and tax buoyancy low, the number of realized <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> are smaller than the target, the fall in the percentage realized <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> to target and low awareness of paying taxes. To solve that problems, economic factors also need to be included in addition to see their effects to <b>tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> The goals of this research was to analyze the effect of income per capita, inflation and openness to <b>tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> This study uses a Keynes Theory and Romer - Lucas Theory. The data used is secondary data obtained from the Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia, Central Statistics Institution and World Bank. The approach used is a Multiple Linear Regression with time series data 1984 – 2015. Dependent variable of this research is <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> with income per capita, inflation and openness as independent variable.

5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that their <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E

5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
