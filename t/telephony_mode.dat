50|$|In <b>telephony,</b> <b>mode</b> 3 is {{a method}} of line sharing in which the line passes through a device (the mode 3 device) to connect to other devices. This enables the mode 3 device to control the line, and gain {{priority}} in need.|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} EM Location System was fabricated {{and tested}} at the Geneva Mine near Dragerton, Utah. This system consisted of six manpack transmitters and six manpack receivers covering the frequency band from 900 Hz to 2900 Hz {{as well as}} a six channel receiver designed for use in a helicopter. Tests showed that EM signals from lightweight (314 lb) transmitters could be detected both on the surface and from a helicopter through - 2 as much as 1650 ft of relatively high conductivity (2 X 10 mhos/m) over- burden. Furthermore, the resulting field strength profiles could be used to determine source location to within 150 ft of the actual surveyed location in the mine. Modifications were made to a Monitoring, Locating and Communications System being tested at the Bruceton Mine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These modifications have improved the performance and quality of the paging and voice <b>telephony</b> <b>mode</b> of the system. Subsurface receiver modifications have improved reception of voice downlink signals...|$|E
2500|$|Contests {{exist for}} enthusiasts of all modes. [...] Some {{contests}} {{are restricted to}} just CW emissions using the Morse code for communications, some are restricted to <b>telephony</b> <b>modes</b> and spoken communications, and some employ digital emissions modes such as RTTY or PSK31. [...] Many popular contests are offered on two separate weekends, one for CW and one for telephony, with all the same rules. [...] The CQ World Wide WPX Contest, for example, is held as a phone-only competition one weekend in March, and a CW-only competition one weekend in May. [...] Some contests, especially those restricted to a single radio frequency band, allow the competing stations to use several different emissions modes. [...] VHF contests typically permit any mode of emission, including some specialty digital modes designed specifically for use on those bands. [...] As with the other variations in contest rules and participation structure, some contest stations and operators choose to specialize in contests on certain modes and may not participate seriously in contests on other modes. Large, worldwide contests on the HF bands can be scheduled for up to forty-eight hours in duration. [...] Typically, these large worldwide contests run from 0000 UTC on Saturday morning until 2359 UTC Sunday evening. [...] Regional and smaller contests often are scheduled for a shorter duration, with twenty-four, twelve, and four hours being common variations.|$|R

40|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{created a}} {{framework}} for competition in local telecommunications. Under its rules and {{under the jurisdiction of}} state regulatory authorities, competitive local telephone companies were to gain access to some or all parts of the incumbent's network through known wholesale tariffs and offer retail local telephone service. As customers adopt other technologies for communications–mobile wireless service, broadband for email, messaging, and information retrieval–additional competitive pressures are put on the core voice telephone market. The substitution of usage and access from local <b>telephony</b> to other <b>modes</b> of communication is regarded as intermodal competition and {{is the subject of this}} paper. This study concerns local telecommunications competition between incumbent and competitive service providers in the United States. In addition to measuring competition from within the wireline market, we find significant intermodal competitive impacts resulting from wireless and high-speed development. We report empirical results from an econometric model that measures line loss impacts between carriers and the effects of wireless and high-speed services on the wireline market. The paper offers interpretation of the strategic and policy implications of these results. Business Economics (2005) 40, 18 – 28; doi: 10. 2145 / 20050202...|$|R
