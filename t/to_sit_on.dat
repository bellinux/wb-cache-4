5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

5|$|In early drafts, the elephant's name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was {{apparently}} after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the eggs for the bird, {{who was very}} reluctant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the couch.|$|E

5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> {{the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E

This would lead to him serving on the ICAEW council from 1948 to 1957.|$|E

5|$|When the Ottomans, who {{based their}} {{state on the}} Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, MehmedII {{established}} his capital there and claimed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the throne of the Roman Empire.

5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he advised her {{of the importance of}} gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E
5|$|Clarke held a big {{advantage}} in the campaign as he {{was supported by the}} Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the Northwest Territories council.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He was chosen <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a committee that would draft Kentucky's {{response to the}} Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions {{was based on the}} logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, he was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the University Council of Victoria's third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a {{move away from the}} English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.|$|E
5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E
