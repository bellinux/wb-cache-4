40|$|The pentagastrin-tiotidine {{interaction}} {{has been}} analysed, using improved techniques, in the mouse isolated, lumen-perfused, stomach assay. For comparison and quantification of the H 2 -receptor blocking activity of <b>tiotidine,</b> histamine-tiotidine interactions {{have also been}} analysed in the mouse stomach and guinea-pig isolated right atrial preparation. <b>Tiotidine</b> behaved as a competitive antagonist of histamine both in the guinea-pig right atrium (pKB 7. 57) and mouse stomach (pKB 6. 96). The difference in pKB was attributed {{to the loss of}} <b>tiotidine</b> into the gastric secretion. On the stomach assay, pentagastrin concentration-effect curves were significantly flatter with lower maximal responses than those obtained to histamine. In addition the profile of inhibition observed with <b>tiotidine</b> was different in that the pentagastrin curve maxima were depressed with only a small concomitant dextrad shift. A mathematical model has been developed which accounts for the differences in agonist concentration-effect curves and describes in a quantitative manner the expectations for the competitive antagonism of endogenous histamine assumed to be released by pentagastrin. Fitting of the pentagastrin-tiotidine data to this model provided a reasonable goodness-of-fit. The results are discussed in terms of the role of endogenous histamine in gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. We conclude that the results are consistent with the hypothesis that pentagastrin stimulates acid secretion via the release of endogenous histamine under the present experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{utilized}} {{the technique of}} polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers based upon the nucleotide sequence of the canine H 2 histamine receptor gene which we recently isolated to clone its human homologue. Transfection of a construct of this gene in Colo- 320 DM cells led to {{the expression of a}} receptor that bound to [methyl- 3 H] <b>tiotidine</b> and was linked to 3 ', 5 ' cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in response to histamine. Both cAMP generation and [methyl- 3 H] <b>tiotidine</b> binding were inhibited with the H 2 histamine receptor selective antagonist cimetidine but not diphenhydramine or thioperamide which are, respectively, H 1 and H 3 histamine receptor antagonists. These data confirm that we have successfully cloned a novel gene encoding the human H 2 histamine receptor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the presence and}} functional role of the histamine H 2 receptor (H 2 R) palmitoylation, a receptor with a Cys 305 to Ala (A 305 receptor) mutation was generated. Wild-type (WT) and A 305 receptors were tagged at their N-termini with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. WT, but not A 305, receptors incorporated [3 H]palmitate by metabolic labeling, indicating that the H 2 R is palmitoylated at Cys 305. Immunocytochemistry of WT and A 305 receptors expressed in COS 7 cells revealed WT receptors to be distributed at the plasma membrane, {{while the majority of}} A 305 receptors were localized intracellularly with only a small portion being at the plasma membrane. However, the affinity of the A 305 receptor for <b>tiotidine</b> was comparable to that of the WT receptor. In addition, when the amounts of cell surface receptors as determined by anti-HA antibody binding were equivalent, A 305 receptors mediated production of more cAMP than WT receptors. Preincubation of COS 7 cells expressing each receptor with 10 − 5 M histamine for 30 min reduced subsequent cAMP production in response to histamine via the receptors to similar extents, indicating that palmitoylation is not necessary for desensitization. In addition, cell surface A 305 receptors were capable of being internalized from the cell surface at a rate and extent similar to those of WT receptors. Finally, CHO cell lines stably expressing either WT or A 305 receptors were incubated with 10 − 5 M histamine for 1, 6, 12 and 24 h. Total amounts of WT and A 305 receptors, as determined by <b>tiotidine</b> binding, were reduced by incubation, indicating downregulation. Downregulation of the A 305 receptor was more extensive than that of the WT receptor. Thus, palmitoylation of the H 2 R might be important for targeting to the cell surface and stability...|$|E
40|$|G-protein-coupled receptors {{generally}} share {{a similar}} structure containing seven membrane-spanning domains and extracellular site(s) for N-glycosylation. The histamine H 2 receptor {{is a member}} of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, and has three extracellular potential sites for N-glycosylation (Asn- 4, Asn- 162 and Asn- 168). To date, however, no information has been presented regarding N-glycosylation of the H 2 receptor. To investigate the presence, location and functional roles of N-glycosylation of the H 2 receptor, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to eliminate the potential site(s) for N-glycosylation singly and collectively. The wild-type and mutated H 2 receptors were expressed stably in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or transiently in COS 7 cells. Immunoblotting of the wild-type and mutated H 2 receptors with an antiserum directed against the C-terminus of the H 2 receptor showed that mutation at Asn- 162, but not at Asn- 168, resulted in a substantial decrease in the molecular mass. A mutation at Asn- 4 led to a further decrease in the molecular mass. Tunicamycin treatment of the transfected cells yielded a sharp band with a molecular mass identical to that of the mutant devoid of all three potential sites for N-glycosylation. These findings indicate that the H 2 receptor is N-glycosylated, and that N-glycosylation takes place mainly at two sites, Asn- 4 and Asn- 162. Neither the affinity for <b>tiotidine</b> nor that for histamine was affected by the mutagenesis. Immunocytochemistry and <b>tiotidine</b> binding showed that the mutated receptors were exclusively distributed on the cell surface in a fashion similar to that of the wild-type. In addition, the glycosylation-defective receptor was capable of activating adenylate cyclase and elevating the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in response to histamine in stable CHO cell lines. Thus N-glycosylation of the H 2 receptor is not required for cell surface localization, ligand binding or functional coupling to G-protein(s) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of histamine-stimulated adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in slices of rabbit cerebral cortex have been investigated. The selective H 2 -receptor antagonists, cimetidine, <b>tiotidine,</b> metiamide and ranitidine appeared to antagonize the stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine {{in a competitive}} manner consistent with an interaction with histamine H 2 -receptors. The H 1 -receptor antagonist mepyramine (0. 8 microM) produced only a weak inhibition of the response to histamine. The inhibition appeared to be non-competitive producing {{a decrease in the}} maximal response with little effect on the EC 50 value. The specific H 2 -receptor agonist, impromidine, produced a maximum response of only 31 +/- 2 % of that obtained with histamine. Studies with histamine and impromidine in combination indicated that impromidine was not acting as a partial agonist. 2 -Thiazolylethylamine, a selective H 1 -agonist, produced only a weak response (EC 50 approximately 1 mM) yielding a relative potency with respect to histamine (= 100) of 2. 5. In the presence of a supramaximal concentration of impromidine, histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine further elevated the response to impromidine. In these conditions the relative potency of 2 -thiazolylethylamine was increased to 59 (histamine = 100), a value which was comparable with that reported for H 1 -receptor-mediated contractions of guinea-pig ileum. The H 1 -receptor antagonists mepyramine, promethazine, triprolidine and chlorpheniramine competitively antagonized the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine in rabbit cerebral cortex without affecting the response to impromidine alone. (+) -Chlorpheniramine was some 150 fold more potent than the (-) -isomer in this respect. Histamine and adenosine in combination had a much greater than additive effect on the accumulation of cyclic AMP in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. The potentiation of the adenosine response could be partially but not completely antagonized by either cimetidine or mepyramine. In the presence of H 2 -receptor blockade with 0. 02 mM <b>tiotidine,</b> histamine elicited a significant potentiation (EC 50 44 microM) of the response to adenosine. This response was antagonized competitively by mepyramine yielding a KB value of 0. 05 microM similar to that obtained from inhibition of the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP (0. 02 microM). These results suggest that there are two components in the response to histamine in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{selectivity}} of 4 -methylhistamine (4 -MH) as an agonist at histamine H 1 - and H 2 -receptors {{has been}} evaluated in the guinea-pig isolated ileum. The EC 50 values of 4 -MH on H 1 - and H 2 -receptors that mediate contractile responses were determined. The EC 50 at H 1 -receptors was estimated after selective blockade of H 2 -receptors by <b>tiotidine</b> and the EC 50 at H 2 -receptors estimated after selective blockade of H 1 -receptors by mepyramine. The -log EC 50 values at H 1 - and at H 2 -receptors were 4. 57 and 5. 23, respectively. The dissociation constants for {{the interaction of}} 4 -MH with H 1 - and H 2 -receptors were determined. The -log KD values at H 1 - and H 2 -receptors were 3. 55 and 4. 27, respectively. These results suggest that 4 -MH is only about 5 times as potent at H 2 - as it is at H 1 -receptors in the guinea-pig ileum and that 4 -MH should be used with caution to discriminate between H 1 - and H 2 -receptors...|$|E
40|$|Although oxyntic cell {{secretion}} can {{be studied}} at many organisation levels between isolated cell suspensions and non-invasive techniques in animals, the isolated, lumen-perfused, stomach preparation of the mouse represents a hierarchical level which eliminates extrinsic regulatory influences but retains all the cellular architecture known to be necessary for physiological responses and so {{can be defined as}} the physiological unit of acid secretion. The feeding pattern before and the distending pressure during an experiment have been identified as the main determinants of basal secretion: the combination of an intragastric pressure of 12 cmH 2 O and the fasted state generated a stable basal secretion over 2 h providing a satisfactory basis for bioassays. Basal acid secretion was lowered by treatment with omeprazole and sodium thiocyanate but not with tetrodotoxin, N-methylatropine or <b>tiotidine,</b> suggesting that basal secretion does not involve nervous stimulation or the local release of histamine under these experimental conditions. The improved assay permitted the full characterization of cumulative agonist concentration-effect curves in single stomach preparations to histamine, 5 -methylfurmethide, pentagastrin and isobutyl-methylxanthine. Interestingly, pentagastrin produced sustained stimulation of gastric acid secretion under conditions when there was no pharmacological evidence that histamine secretion was taking place. This finding is discussed in relation to the role of histamine in the control of gastric acid secretion...|$|E
40|$|Histamine is {{generally}} regarded as a pro-inflammatory mediator in diseases such as allergy and asthma. A growing number of studies, however, suggest that this autacoid is also involved in the downregulation of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions and inflammatory responses through activation of the Gs-coupled histamine H 2 receptor. We report here that histamine inhibits thapsigargin- and ligand (PAF and fMLP) -induced leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis in human PMN in a dose-dependent manner. The suppressive effect of histamine on LT biosynthesis was abrogated by the histamine H 2 receptor antagonists cimetidine, ranitidine, and <b>tiotidine.</b> In contrast, the histamine H 1, H 3, and H 4 receptor antagonists {{used in this study}} were ineffective in counteracting the inhibitory effect of histamine on the biosynthesis of LT in activated human PMN. The inhibition of LT biosynthesis by histamine was characterized by decreased arachidonic acid release and 5 -lipoxygenase translocation to the nuclear membrane. Incubation of PMN with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor N-[2 -(p-bromocinnamylamino) ethyl]- 5 -isoquinoline-sulfonamide prevented the inhibitory effect of histamine on LT biosynthesis, suggesting an important role for PKA in this effect of histamine on LT biosynthesis in PMN. These data provide the first evidences that, similarly to adenosine and prostaglandin E 2, histamine is a potent suppressor of LT biosynthesis, and support the concept that histamine may play a dual role in the regulation of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{substantia nigra}} pars reticulata (SNr) forms a {{principal}} output from the basal ganglia. It also receives significant histamine (HA) {{input from the}} tuberomammillary nucleus whose functions in SNr remain poorly understood. One identified role is the regulation of serotonin (5 -HT) neurotransmission via the HA-H(3) receptor. Here we have explored regulation by another HA receptor expressed in SNr, the H(2) -receptor (H(2) R), by monitoring electrically evoked 5 -HT release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in SNr in rat brain slices. Selective H(2) R antagonists (inverse agonists) ranitidine and <b>tiotidine</b> enhanced 5 -HT release while the agonist amthamine suppressed release. The 'neutral' competitive antagonist burimamide alone was without effect but prevented ranitidine actions indicating that inverse agonist effects result from constitutive H(2) R activity independent of HA tone. H(2) R control of 5 -HT release was most apparent (from inverse agonist effects) at lower frequencies of depolarization (< or = 20 Hz), and prevailed {{in the presence of}} antagonists of GABA, glutamate or H(3) -HA receptors. These data reveal that H(2) Rs in SNr are constitutively active and inhibit 5 -HT release through H(2) Rs on 5 -HT axons. These data may have therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease, when SNr HA levels increase, and for neuropsychiatric disorders in which 5 -HT is pivotal...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we report a {{combined}} experimental and computational study concerning the effects of deuteration on the binding of histamine and two other histaminergic agonists to 3 H-tiotidine-labeled histamine H 2 receptor in neonatal rat astrocytes. Binding affinities were measured by displacing radiolabeled <b>tiotidine</b> from H 2 receptor binding sites present on cultured neonatal rat astrocytes. Quantum-chemical calculations were performed by employing the empirical quantization of nuclear motion within a cluster model of the receptor binding site extracted from the homology model of the entire H 2 receptor. Structure of H 2 receptor built by homology modelling is attached in the supporting information (S 1 Table) Experiments clearly demonstrate that deuteration affects the binding by increasing the affinity for histamine and reducing it for 2 -methylhistamine, while basically leaving it unchanged for 4 -methylhistamine. Ab initio quantum-chemical calculations on the cluster system extracted from the homology H 2 model along with the implicit quantization of the acidic N-H and O-H bonds demonstrate that these changes in the binding can be rationalized by the altered strength of the hydrogen bonding upon deuteration known as the Ubbelohde effect. Our computational analysis also reveals a new mechanism of histamine binding, which underlines an important role of Tyr 250 residue. The present work is, to our best knowledge, the first study of nuclear quantum effects on ligand receptor binding. The ligand H/D substitution is relevant for therapy {{in the context of}} perdeuterated and thus more stable drugs that are expected to enter therapeutic practice in the near future. Moreover, presented approach may contribute towards understanding receptor activation, while a distant goal remains in silico discrimination between agonists and antagonists based on the receptor structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{histamine}} to inhibit the overall contractile ('twitch') {{response of the}} isolated vas deferens of the mouse to electrical field stimulation (64 V pulse, 1 ms pulse width, frequency 0. 2 Hz) was studied in nine inbred mouse strains. The strains were also characterized {{in terms of the}} potency of the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist cimetidine in its inhibition of histamine-mediated effects. An apparently bimodal inter-strain variation (8 - 10 fold) in both characteristics was encountered, with three strains (SWR, A 2 G and C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn) relatively sensitive (S) to both agonist and antagonist actions, and six (C 3 H, A, C 57 /BL 6, DBA/ 2, Balb/C and 129 /Sv) relatively insensitive (IS). These strain differences were independent of extracellular calcium concentration in the range 1. 25 - 5 mM, and also independent of the frequency of tissue stimulation over the range 0. 2 - 6. 4 Hz. Representative S (SWR and A 2 G) and IS (DBA/ 2 and C 3 H) mouse vasa were also characterized in terms of their sensitivity to the agonist actions of dimaprit and the antagonist actions of <b>tiotidine.</b> In the S strain tissues, dimaprit produced 50 % inhibition of the twitch response at 4. 6 - 1. 8 microM (mean +/- s. d.) and was able to elicit complete inhibition of the twitch response at concentrations greater than 100 microM, whereas 48. 7 +/- 11. 9 microM dimaprit was required to produce 50 % inhibition of the twitch response in tissues from IS mice. In addition, the agonist actions of dimaprit were incomplete in the latter tissues, the drug eliciting no more than 75 % inhibition of the twitch response at concentrations in the range 300 - 1000 microM.

40|$|Resonance is a biophysical {{characteristic}} of a subset of neurons in which the voltage response of oscillating input peaks at a preferred frequency. Given the widespread distribution of histaminergic neurons and the known physiology of histamine receptors in the CNS, {{it was hypothesized that}} histamine modulates the resonance of pyramidal neurons by shifting the activation and kinetics of the hyperpolarization activated cationic current, Ih. [...] Employing standard whole cell voltage clamp recording, investigation of the modulation of Ih was confounded by a time dependent hyperpolarizing shift of Ih. The addition of cAMP to the recording pipette prevented rundown and resulted in a depolarizing shift in Ih activation consistent with an important role for intracellular cAMP in the maintenance and modulation of Ih. [...] In the presence of cAMP in the pipette, bath application of histamine, 8 -bromo-cAMP, and forskolin, mimicked cAMP-induced changes in Ih. Histamine's action was mimicked by amthamine (H₂ agonist), blocked by <b>tiotidine</b> (H₂ antagonist), and occluded by forskolin, consistent with an H₂ receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. H 7, a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor, blocked both the forskolin and histamine-induced effects on Ih consistent with involvement of a phosphorylation event. [...] Using the Impedance Amplitude Profile (ZAP) methodology to profile the resonant properties of pyramidal neurons, histamine increased both the resonant frequency (fres) and its magnitude (Q) in a concentration-dependent manner that closely resembled histamine's action on Ih. This was confirmed by application of ZD- 7288, an [...] irreversible blocker of Ih, which blocked both the histamine-induced action and resonance. [...] It is concluded that histamine, acting via H₂ receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase and possibly a protein kinase, shifts the activation of h to more depolarized potentials. This action modulates the resonant behaviour of these neurons, which in tum can influence their oscillatory properties and consequently aid in the synchronization of larger neuronal networks...|$|E
40|$|Rat {{histamine}} H 2 receptors were epitope-tagged {{with six}} histidine residues at the C-terminus to allow immunological detection of the receptor. Recombinant baculoviruses containing the epitope-tagged H 2 receptor were prepared and {{were used to}} infect insect Sf 9 cells. The His-tagged H 2 receptors expressed in insect Sf 9 cells showed typical H 2 receptor characteristics as determined with [125 I]-aminopotentidine (APT) binding studies. In Sf 9 cells expressing the His-tagged H 2 receptor histamine was able to stimulate cyclic AMP production 9 fold (EC 50 = 2. 1 ± 0. 1 [*]μM) by use of the endogenous signalling pathway. The classical antagonists cimetidine, ranitidine and <b>tiotidine</b> inhibited histamine induced cyclic AMP production with Ki values of 0. 60 ± 0. 43 [*]μM, 0. 25 ± 0. 15 [*]μM and 28 ± 7 [*]nM, respectively (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3). The expression of the His-tagged H 2 receptors in infected Sf 9 cells reached functional levels of 6. 6 ± 0. 6 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1 protein (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3) after 3 days of infection. This represents about 2 × 106 copies of receptor/cell. Preincubation of the cells with 0. 03 [*]mM cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin complex resulted in an increase of [125 I]-APT binding up to 169 ± 5 % (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3). The addition of 0. 03 [*]mM cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin complex did not affect histamine-induced cyclic AMP production. The EC 50 value of histamine was 3. 1 ± 1. 7 [*]μM {{in the absence of}} cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin complex and 11. 1 ± 5. 5 [*]μM in the presence of cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin complex (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3). Also, the amount of cyclic AMP produced in the presence of 100 [*]μM histamine was identical, 85 ± 18 [*]pmol/ 106 cells in the absence and 81 ± 11 [*]pmol/ 106 cells in the presence of 0. 03 [*]mM cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin complex (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3). Immunofluorescence studies with an antibody against the His-tag revealed {{that the majority of the}} His-tagged H 2 receptors was localized inside the insect Sf 9 cells, although plasma membrane labelling could be identified as well. These experiments demonstrate the successful expression of His-tagged histamine H 2 receptors in insect Sf 9 cells. The H 2 receptors couple functionally to the insect cell adenylate cyclase. However, our studies with cholesterol complementation and with immunofluorescent detection of the His-tag reveal that only a limited amount of H 2 receptor protein is functional.

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, {{a large amount of}} {{experimental}} data (for example Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) at fluorescently labelled receptors) supported the hypothesis of the dimerization of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), including neuropeptide Y (NPY YxR) and histamine (HxR) receptors. Targeting GPCR dimers could be helpful to understand (patho) physiological processes and may be applied therapeutically. This work aimed at the exploration of the applicability of FRET-based and ligand-based approaches to the investigation of NPY Y 1 R and histamine H 2 R dimers. Special attention was paid to bivalent NG-acylated hetarylpropylguanidines, the most potent H 2 R agonists, known so far, which were initially designed to bind to the orthosteric recognition sites of dimerized H 2 R protomers. Surprisingly, agonists having octamethylene linkers, insufficient in length to bridge two adjacent receptor molecules, proved to be most active. Thus, the intent of this thesis was to investigate the assumed mode of binding of such “twin compounds”, e. g. with respect to the ternary complex model, allosterism and functional selectivity. Fluorescently labelled NPY Y 1 receptors: Human Y 1 Rs, tagged either with enhanced cyan (ECFP) or with yellow fluorescent proteins (EYFP), were stably expressed in human U- 373 MG glioblastoma cells (plasmids from Prof. Dr. A. Beck-Sickinger, University of Leipzig). Membranal localization of the labelled receptors was confirmed by radioligand and flow cytometric binding assays. However, imaging of the transfected U- 373 MG and CHO cells by means of confocal microscopy (CLSM) revealed primarily intracellular distribution of the fusion proteins, precluding prospective FRET-based investigations of receptor dimerization. Additionally, bivalent argininamide-type Y 1 R antagonists, developed in our group, did not support the hypothesis of receptor dimerization. Thus, all further work was focused on bivalent H 2 R/H 4 R ligands. Hill slopes of bivalent H 2 R/H 4 R ligands: Radioligand binding assays were performed on Sf 9 membranes, expressing either the human (h) or guinea-pig (gp) H 2 R-GsαS fusion protein or the hH 4 R, because the imidazolylpropylguanidine moiety {{turned out to be a}} privileged structure with respect to histamine receptors (cooperation with Prof. Dr. Roland Seifert, Medical School of Hannover). Saturation binding experiments confirmed that <b>tiotidine</b> is an inverse agonist of H 2 R, and that fusing of the H 2 Rs and GsαS proteins did not alter ligand-receptor interactions. GTPγS-dependent shifts of the competition binding curves, predicted by the ternary complex model, were found for monovalent H 2 R agonists, but not for the bivalent ligands, tested at the gpH 2 R-GsαS, suggesting antagonism rather than agonism. Additionally, Hill coefficients (nH) 1 (positive cooperativity) for the bivalent compound with a 20 mem¬bered linker, approximated unity after very long periods of incubation (gpH 2 R-GsαS and hH 4 R), disclosing the failure of having reached equilibrium. Radioligand off-rate (k 2) : Radioligand dissociation kinetics at the gpH 2 R-GsαS and the hH 4 R (k 2 of [3 H]histamine at hH 4 R: 0. 0108 ± 0. 0007 min- 1, reported for the first time) revealed a concentration-dependent increase in k 2 in the presence of bivalent ligands. This could result from amphiphilic properties (for the “longer” bivalent compounds) or from an existence of the allosteric binding site either at the same protomer or at a neighboring receptor. H 2 R internalization: Clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis was visualized in transfected CHO cells by confocal microscopy (CLSM). Both mono- and bivalent H 2 R agonists, but not bivalent antagonists (with respect to G-protein activation), induced the internalization of human H 2 Rs fused to the monomeric far-red fluorescent protein mKate 2. These observations were in line with previously obtained functional data from GTPase assays, and there is no evidence for unconventional (biased) signalling of the hH 2 R. By contrast, agonist-dependent activities of standard antagonists were found in GTPase assays at the hH 2 R-GsαS in presence of a bivalent agonist with an 8 -membered linker. In conclusion, the obtained results cannot be solely explained by the competitive binding model. Considering the size of the bivalent H 2 R/H 4 R ligands, additional temporary interactions with the extracellular domains of the receptors seem to be inevitable. Provided that the ortho- and the allosteric binding sites were occupied by two pharmacophoric moieties simultaneously, these bivalent compounds might act as true dualsteric ligands. Future work at the H 2 R and the H 4 R should be focused on the differentiation between G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-mediated signalling. Additionally, the preparation of a bivalent radioligand is suggested to determine the ligand-receptor stoichiometry...|$|E
