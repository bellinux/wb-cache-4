5|$|The castle {{formed the}} {{backdrop}} for several scenes in William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Another Henry Percy inherited the family estates in 1585 and assumed the title of 9thEarl of Northumberland. After the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, the earl was imprisoned for his connection with Thomas Percy, one of the plotters. Shortly before he was sentenced (he was fined £30,000 and held in the Tower of London), the earl leased Warkworth Castle to Sir Ralph Gray, who owned Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Gray neglected the earl's building and allowed it to fall further into disrepair. The lead from the buildings in the bailey was sold in 1607 to alleviate the earl's financial problems. When JamesI visited in 1617 en route to Scotland, his entourage was angered by <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> state of the castle. With the unification of England and Scotland under a single ruler, the earls of Northumberland had no need for two great castles near the Anglo-Scottish border; they maintained Alnwick {{at the expense of}} Warkworth. In {{the first quarter of the}} 17thcentury, the keep was used to hold manor courts and for the laying out of oats.|$|E

On December 20, 1892, Colajanni read out long extracts in Parliament and Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was forced to appoint an expert commission to investigate the bank.

But Alexander, seeing <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> state of the enemy forces and advised by Mondragón and Gonzaga of the opportunity to surprise the enemy, gave the order to charge. After several clashes with the Spanish cavalry, the Netherlandish cavalry, which was protecting the rear of their forces, fled towards the army, causing an enormous panic amongst the rebel troops. The result was a crushing victory by Parma's cavalry. The entire army's order disintegrated, and the almost unopposed Spanish cavalry massacred fleeing troops.|$|E

25|$|Despite the raids, the Portuguese {{authorities}} {{were unable to}} raise an extensive defensive system for the city due to interference from Chinese officials. The means of defense that Macau {{had at the time}} were limited to a few batteries: one at the west end of the Macau Peninsula (later site of the São Thiago da Barra fortress), one {{at each end of the}} southern bay of Praia Grande (São Francisco on the east and Bom Parto on the west), and the half-completed Fortaleza do Monte overlooking the Cathedral of St. Paul. <b>The</b> <b>sorry</b> state of Macau's defenses was made known to the Hollanders when the Dutch ship Gallias seized a Portuguese ship carrying a case of letters off the coast of Malaya at the end of 1621. Judging by these intercepted letters and information available from Japan, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Jan Pieterszoon Coen considered that Macau was not in a position to resist a serious attack, and set his invasion plan in motion.|$|E

500|$|At this point, <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> {{state of}} the Byzantine fleet had dire consequences. The Norman {{invasion}} could not be forestalled, and their army seized Corfu, landed unopposed in Epirus and laid siege to Dyrrhachium, starting a decade of war which consumed the scant resources of the embattled Empire. The new emperor, Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118), was forced to call upon {{the assistance of the}} Venetians, who in the 1070s had already asserted their control of the Adriatic and Dalmatia against the Normans. In 1082, in exchange for their help, he granted them major trading concessions. This treaty, and subsequent extensions of these privileges, practically rendered the Byzantines hostage to the Venetians (and later also the Genoese and the Pisans).

500|$|At {{the start}} of the innings, Bradman used off theory, but left a large gap square of the wicket in an attempt to coax England's out-of-form top-order to play risky shots into the {{inviting}} gap. However, Bradman's offer was spurned as Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously. Meanwhile, Australia's attack appeared unsettled. Bradman set defensive fields for most of the first day as England's openers put on 168 for the first wicket. O'Reilly said that Bradman's defensive field settings [...] "made <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> admission of impotency". England's batsmen dominated to reach stumps at 2/268. Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and was its worst day of bowling since the Second World War, citing the proliferation of full tosses. O'Reilly criticised the display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said that no bowler could be excused. He said that the attack [...] "functioned without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He lambasted the bowlers for performing at a standard akin to county cricket. O'Reilly criticised the players for having a casual and lethargic manner, speculating that Bradman had been allowed them to become complacent.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich Foertsch was {{released}} from captivity on 9 October 1955. Bundeskanzler Konrad Adenauer had helped secure {{the release of the}} last German prisoners of war in 1955, a decade {{after the end of the}} war. He joined the Bundeswehr after the remilitarisation of the Federal Republic of Germany holding the rank of Generalmajor. His initial task was the leadership of the II. Korps and he was appointed commanding officer of the 2. Grenadier-Division in April 1957. He was then posted to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of Nato in Paris as deputy chief of the fundamental planning office. He succeeded Adolf Heusinger as the second Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr on 1 April 1961. Under his command the compulsory military service in the Bundeswehr was extended from 12 to 18 months. [...] He was also in command during the political Spiegel scandal, which led to the resignation of Federal Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauß. Der Spiegel, a widely read German periodical, had published the article [...] "Bedingt abwehrbereit" [...] ("Conditionally prepared for defense") about a NATO maneuver called Fallex 62, Fall Exercise 1962, in which the NATO forces were to demonstrate their preparedness to resist possible attack by the Soviet Union and/or other Eastern Block forces. [...] The maneuvers themselves had demonstrated the Bundeswehr's incapacity to repel attack, and the article exposed <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> state of Bundeswehr preparedness.|$|E

500|$|Griffin has {{frequently}} expressed views on Judaism, Islam and homosexuality. His {{comments on the}} Holocaust (which he once referred to as [...] "the Holohoax") made as an editor of The Rune demonstrate revisionism. He criticised Holocaust denier David Irving for admitting that up to four million Jews might {{have died in the}} Holocaust; he wrote [...] "True Revisionists will not be fooled by this new twist to <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> tale of The Hoax of the Twentieth Century." [...] In 1997, he told an undercover journalist that he had updated Richard Verrall's booklet Did Six Million Really Die? and, in the same year, he wrote Who are the Mindbenders?, about a perceived domination of the media by Jewish figures. [...] Despite this, the BNP had a Jewish councillor, Patricia Richardson, and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members. The BNP has stated that it does not deny the Holocaust, and that [...] "Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist." [...] In an interview with the BNP deputy leader Simon Darby, Griffin claimed that the English Defence League was a [...] "Zionist false flag operation", and added that the organisation is [...] "a neo-con operation". He also claimed that the EDL's activities are an attempt to provoke civil war.|$|E
500|$|Broadly, {{the critics}} did not welcome Fleming's {{experiment}} with the Bond formula; academic Christoph Linder {{has pointed out that}} The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books. The Daily Telegraph, for example, wrote [...] "Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!" [...] while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: [...] "His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail." [...] Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as [...] "a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation", going on to hope that [...] "this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking [...] "why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?" [...] The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, whom they describe as [...] "less a person than a cult" [...] who is [...] "ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that [...] "the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment". John Fletcher thought that it was [...] "as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association".|$|E
500|$|In bright sunshine, Bradman {{called on}} the off spin of Ian Johnson, who had {{delivered}} only three overs to this point, {{the rest of the}} proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman set a defensive ring field, with no slip in place. While Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, Washbrook took 24 at the other end to reach 85. O'Reilly said Bradman's defensive field settings [...] "made <b>the</b> <b>sorry</b> admission of impotency". Bradman then called for the new ball with the score on 164, which Hutton on-drove for four from Lindwall. This took the opening partnership to 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership ended on the very next ball when Hutton went onto the front foot and was clean bowled by Lindwall, much to the dismay of the home crowd. Nevertheless, England had made a strong start, continuing their spirited showing in the previous Test. Washbrook was joined by Edrich, who had scored two 50s in the Third Test at Old Trafford after a lean start to the series. O'Reilly said the hosts' incoming batsmen had an ideal opportunity to amass a large score as [...] "the Australian attack was completely {{at the mercy of the}} two Englishmen. It had lost all its sting and looked quite innocuous." ...|$|E
