2500|$|Much of {{the above}} {{analysis}} is predicated on voter turnout as measured {{as a percentage of}} the voting-age population. In a 2001 article in the American Political Science Review, Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin argued, that at least in the United States, voter turnout since 1972 has not actually declined when calculated for those eligible to vote, what they term the voting-eligible population. [...] In 1972, noncitizens and ineligible felons (depending on state law) constituted about 2% of the voting-age population. By 2004, ineligible voters constituted nearly 10%. Ineligible voters are not evenly distributed across the country – 20% of California's voting-age population is ineligible to vote – which confounds comparisons of states. Furthermore, they argue that an examination of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey shows that turnout is low but not declining among the youth, when the high youth turnout of 1972 (the first year 18- to 20-year-olds were eligible to vote in most states) is removed from the <b>trendline.</b>|$|E

She canvassed door-to-door for her 1972 legislative race while pregnant with her third child, William. In 1985, {{when looking at the}} <b>trendline</b> that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] I find myself in many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'

50|$|You’ve {{discovered}} how changes in direction {{are the way}} the KST triggers signals, but also that moving-average crossovers offer less timely, but more reliable signals. The average to use is a simple 10-day moving average. It is possible to anticipate a moving average crossover if the KST has already turned and the price violates a <b>trendline.</b> The KST started to reverse to the downside before the up <b>trendline</b> was violated. Since either a reversal or a trading range follow a valid <b>trendline</b> violation, it’s evident that upside momentum has temporarily dissipated, causing the KST to cross below its moving average. Traditionally, the MACD gives buy and sell signals when it crosses above and below its exponential moving average, known as the “signal line”. This approach isn’t perfect; the ellipses on the chart highlight all the whipsaws. As said earlier, the KST can also give false or misleading signals, {{as you can see}} from the April 2005 buy signal. It comes close to a couple of whipsaws, but by and large, it’s more accurate, even though the MACD often turns faster than the KST.|$|E

40|$|Ab initio MP 2 /aug′-cc-pVTZ {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out on the pnicogen-bonded homodimers (PH 2 X) 2 and the binary complexes H 2 XP:PYH 2, for X, Y = F, Cl, OH, NC, CCH, CH 3, CN, and H. The binding energies of these complexes are influenced {{by the nature of the}} X,Y pair, the intermolecular distance, the relative orientation of the interacting molecules, and the charge-transfer energies from the lone pair of one P to the σ-hole of the other. Binary complexes with X,Y = F, Cl, OH, and NC, as well as the homodimers, have a trans arrangement of the P-A and P-A′ bonds with respect to the P⋯P bond, with A and A′, the atoms of X and Y, respectively, bonded to the P atoms. The <b>trendlines</b> for the homodimers in plots of the binding energy versus the P-P distance, and the binding energy versus the total charge-transfer energy, exhibit better correlations than the <b>trendlines</b> for the binary complexes. The <b>trendlines</b> for the homodimers mark the boundary of the region in which points for the binary complexes appear. Pnicogen-bond radii for P in PH 2 X molecules have been determined from the P-P distances in the homodimers. The sum of these radii provides an excellent approximation to the P-P distance in the corresponding binary complex. EOM-CCSD spin-spin coupling constants 1 pJ(P-P) have also been computed for all complexes. Coupling constants for the dimers and binary complexes exhibit a similar linear increase as the P-P distance decreases. (Figure Presented). Peer Reviewe...|$|R
