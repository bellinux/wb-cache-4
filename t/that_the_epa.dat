25|$|In 1982 Congress charged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> had mishandled the $1.6 billion {{program to}} clean up {{hazardous}} waste dumps Superfund and demanded records from EPA director Anne M. Gorsuch. She refused {{and became the first}} agency director in U.S. history to be cited for contempt of Congress. The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by executive privilege. At that point, Gorsuch resigned her post, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation. Critics charged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> was in a shambles at that time.|$|E
25|$|The FQPA {{mandates}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> expedite {{the approval}} of reduced risk pesticides. To be considered reduced risk pesticides must have a proven low-impact on human health, have low toxicity to non-target organisms and have a low potential to contaminate groundwater.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the Government Accountability Office stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{violated}} {{federal law}} with covert propaganda on their social media platforms. The social media messaging {{that was used}} promoted materials supporting the Waters of the United States rule, including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule.|$|E
5000|$|Duke Energy {{initially}} {{prevailed in}} both the trial {{as well as the}} appeal in front of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, when they ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> rulings were inconsistent with prior decisions and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> previous interpretation of the NSR would also have to be applied to its application of its PSD rule. <b>The</b> <b>EPA,</b> along with <b>the</b> North Carolina Sierra Club appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which in a unanimous decision, overturned the Fourth Circuit's decision. The Court ruled the term [...] "modification" [...] did not have the same meaning in the PSD and NSPS provisions.|$|R
50|$|Respondents {{support the}} Second Circuit's finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> {{decision}} of site-specific cost-benefit variance provision {{and the use}} of CBA to determine NPS and BAT for existing facilities is not within the statute and remand the regulations to the agency for clarification.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of the bill, {{including}} Rep. Johnson, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> {{rule would}} cause a nationwide shortage of fire hydrants once the new rule {{went into effect in}} January. This is {{due to a lack of}} existing fire hydrants available for installation <b>that</b> already meet <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> rule. Supporters also argued that communities would be stuck with millions of dollars' worth of non-compliant fire hydrants they could not use if <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> rule took effect. Adding additional urgency to the situation, winter is when more hydrants are replaced due to damage from freezing or being hit by cars driving on slippery roads.|$|R
25|$|The Petitioners {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Administrator's {{decision not}} to regulate {{carbon dioxide and other}} greenhouse gases violated the terms of the CAA. Thus, the Supreme Court also considered whether the reasons given by the EPA were valid reasons within the CAA statute for the EPA Administrator to decide not to regulate carbon dioxide. The EPA argued that the Administrator has the discretion under the CAA to decide not to regulate.|$|E
25|$|Drilling has {{increased}} {{two out of}} six “criteria” pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> regulates due to their negative impacts. People who {{come in contact with}} these air pollutants can have severe health problems such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A study has found that people within half a mile from a gas well site {{were more likely to have}} health problems from air pollution than people living farther.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, a {{draft report}} of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{laid the groundwork for}} tough new {{standards}} to limit public exposure to trichloroethylene. The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy, and NASA, who appealed directly to the White House. They argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.|$|E
5000|$|Was the Court of Appeals correct <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> {{decision}} to transfer pollution-permitting authority to Arizona under the Clean Water Act was arbitrary and capricious because {{it was based on}} inconsistent interpretations of the Endangered Species Act? If so, should the Court of Appeals have sent the case back to <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> for further proceedings without ruling on the interpretation of the Endangered Species Act? ...|$|R
40|$|In the Spring of 1993 California and <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> faced-off over <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> new {{mandates}} for checking auto emissions. The California Senate {{asked the}} University of California Transportation Center {{to provide a}} "blue ribbon" evaluation of the issues. This article tells what we discovered. The final picture is not clear enough to distinguish good guys from bad guys, but we can see {{well enough to know}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> new national rules for smog checks are deeply flawed...|$|R
5000|$|TransCanada Corporation {{responded with}} a letter of its own, in which President and CEO Russel K. Girling stated that TransCanada [...] "rejects <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{inference}} <b>that</b> at lower oil prices the XL Pipeline Project will increase the rate of oil sands production growth and accompanying greenhouse gas emissions". Girling maintained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> conclusions [...] "are {{not supported by the}} facts outlined in the Final SEIS or actual observations of the marketplace".|$|R
25|$|One {{of several}} reasons <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Administrator {{declined}} to regulate {{carbon dioxide is}} uncertainty about whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming. This has attracted great attention to the case. However, the Supreme Court only decided whether the Administrator's reason is a valid reason within the CAA. The Supreme Court did not explicitly decide {{if it is true}} or untrue that man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming, although high-profile comments by Justices during oral argument are likely to affect the public debate.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the state}} of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy {{standards}} for new cars. EPA administrator Stephen L. Johnson claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> was working on its own standards, but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level, which would then preempt state laws. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with governors from 13 other states, stated that the EPA's actions ignored federal law, and that existing California standards (adopted by many states in addition to California) were almost twice {{as effective as the}} proposed federal standards. It was reported that Stephen Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision.|$|E
25|$|Gorsuch, {{appointed}} by Ronald Reagan, resigned under fire in 1983. Gorsuch based her {{administration of the}} EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states. She believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut {{the budget of the}} EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries {{they were supposed to be}} regulating. Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.|$|E
50|$|By November 2015, it was claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> PM2.5 Index {{indicated}} poor air qualities {{for almost}} one-third of Taiwan's cities {{for more than}} one hundred days that year, with Nantou topping the list at 147 such days. On November 8, central Taiwan, along with the Yunlin and Chiayi regions, reached the hazardous Purple Alert.|$|R

5000|$|In a post on her Facebook page, {{environmental}} activist Erin Brockovich {{called the}} water crisis a [...] "growing national concern" [...] and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crisis was [...] "likely" [...] {{connected to the}} Legionnaires' disease outbreak. Brockovich called for the U.S. Environment Protection Agency {{to become involved in}} <b>the</b> investigation, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> [...] "continued silence has proven deadly." ...|$|R
25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues {{to be used in}} construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products. Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of Artex, a decorative stipple finish, however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.|$|E
25|$|In West Dallas, Texas, {{a mostly}} African American and Latino community, a lead smelter {{poisoned}} the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares {{for more than}} five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to lead contamination. The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn't until 1981 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> commissioned a study on the lead contamination in this neighborhood, and found the same results that had been found a decade earlier. In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the lead smelter remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the clean up of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn't until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and {{at the time it was}} one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site.|$|E
500|$|Browner found {{criticism}} {{from both sides}} of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods. [...] Her announcement in May 1993 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however. A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support. [...] Many of her legislative desires had to {{take a back seat to}} the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{found in}} favor of the Defenders of Wildlife and invalidated <b>the</b> transfer, finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fish and Wildlife Service opinion was flawed and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> {{reliance}} on it [...] "arbitrary and capricious" [...] and inconsistent with previous transfers of permitting authority, in which the impact on endangered species was considered.|$|R
40|$|Holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{widespread}} {{effects of}} environmental regulation on {{the coal industry}} constituted sufficient importance, the Northern District of West Virginia ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct analysis on employment loss and plant reduction resulting from regulatory effects. In admonishing <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> inaction, <b>the</b> court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Agency had a non-discretionary duty to evaluate employment and plant reduction. Furthermore, <b>the</b> court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> attempt to put forth general reports in place of required evaluations was an invalid attempt to circumvent its statutory duty...|$|R

[...] Peabody Energy hired Laurence Tribe, President Obama's mentor at Harvard Law School, to author a brief which was later acclaimed on the Senate floor.

2500|$|Writing for a 5–4 majority, Justice Antonin Scalia held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{interpreted}} the Clean Air Act unreasonably when it {{decided that it}} should not consider costs when regulating power plants. Justice Scalia analyzed the EPA's interpretation of the Clean Air Act under Chevron Deference, and concluded that the Agency [...] "strayed far beyond [...] bounds" [...] of [...] "reasonable interpretation" [...] when it determined that it could ignore costs. Looking at the language of the Clean Air Act, Justice Scalia concluded that when [...] "ead naturally in the present context, the phrase 'appropriate and necessary' requires at least some attention to cost." [...] Additionally, Justice Scalia wrote that it is irrational and inappropriate [...] "to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits." [...] Consequently, Justice Scalia ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> [...] "must consider cost — including, most importantly, cost of compliance — before deciding whether regulation is appropriate and necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The EPA held {{seven months}} of {{hearings}} in 1971–1972, with scientists giving evidence for and against DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT – exempting public health uses under some conditions. Immediately after the announcement, both EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against EPA. Industry sought to overturn the ban, while EDF wanted a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit [...] ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> had acted properly in banning DDT.|$|E
