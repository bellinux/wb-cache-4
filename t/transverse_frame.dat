2500|$|The New England Barn was {{the most}} common style of barn built in most of the 19th century in rural New England and {{variants}} are found throughout the United States. This style barn superseded the ”three-bay barn” in several important ways. The most obvious difference is the location of the barn doors on the gable-end(s) rather than the sidewall(s). The New England and three bay barns were used similarly as multipurpose farm buildings (housing animals, crop storage and other uses all in one building) but the New England barns are typically larger and have a basement. Culturally the New England Barn represents a shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming thus are larger and show significant changes in American building methods and technologies. Most were used as dairy barns but some housed teams of oxen which are generally called teamster barns. Sometimes these barns are simply called “gable fronted” and “gable fronted bank barns” [...] but these terms are also used for barns other than the New England style barn such as in Maryland [...] and Virginia which is not exactly the same style as found in New England. A similar style found in parts of the American mid-west and south is called a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> barn or transverse crib barn.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advance in}} construction techniques {{was developed by}} naval architect Albert Percy Cole. Instead of going for <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> sections which were unnecessarily strong, but held together by weak longitudinals, Cole went for extra strong longitudinals and weaker transverse frames.|$|E
50|$|The leading {{pony truck}} was of rather complex construction. The weight borne {{on the leading}} wheels was {{transferred}} by a system of beams to a hollow cylindrical plunger, which rested on a rubber pad in a cradle immediately above the truck axle. Instead of a swing beam to control lateral movement, there were two transverse laminated springs, the ends of which were connected to three-point T-headed links. The two upper pins of these links bore on a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> which connected the axle boxes.|$|E
40|$|We apply a {{covariant}} and generic {{procedure to}} obtain explicit {{expressions of the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> that a type I spacetime admits {{in terms of an}} arbitrary initial frame. We also present a simple and general algorithm to obtain the Weyl scalars Ψ T 2, Ψ T 0 and Ψ T 4 associated with these <b>transverse</b> <b>frames.</b> In both cases it is only necessary to choose a particular root of a cubic expression...|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal framing (also {{called the}} Isherwood system after British naval {{architect}} Sir Joseph Isherwood, who patented it in 1906) {{is a method}} of ship construction in which large, widely spaced <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> are {{used in conjunction with}} light, closely spaced longitudinal members. This method, Isherwood felt, lent a ship much greater longitudinal strength than in ships built in the traditional method, where a series of <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> were fit together closely from the keel upwards.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>framed,</b> [...] length overall, [...] {{length between perpendiculars}} double {{bottomed}} hull {{was divided}} into fourteen watertight compartments by watertight bulkheads extending up to [...] "A" [...] deck.|$|R
50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided transverse frames, all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders. These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> girders on each side. The transverse frames were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{proposals}} in July 1915 to order more airships {{to the same}} design as the 9r then being built by Vickers, on 28 August Vickers were asked to design {{a new class of}} airship based on the 9r. To facilitate rapid mass-production, the same <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> design as the 9r were used, but lift was increased by adding an extra bay and by making the nose and tail fuller to accommodate larger gasbags. Power was provided by four [...] Rolls-Royce Eagles. [...] The triangular section exterior keel had a widened section amidships incorporating a bomb bay, sleeping quarters, radio room and toilet. Three gondolas were suspended from the keel. The forward gondola contained the control room and one engine driving a pair of swivelling propellors, a second amidships contained two engines each driving a fixed four-bladed pusher propeller on outriggers, and the aft gondola contained the fourth engine driving a single two-bladed pusher propeller and an emergency control car. Ballast and fuel were carried in tanks along the keel. Rudders and elevators were of the cruciform type. The design drawings were approved on 10 October 1915 ...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of the exhibition gallery will be located in Brno - Stránice. The steel structure of the exhibition gallery {{is made up of}} <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> consisting of columns and truss trusses. The <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> are reinforced by means of roof, wall and longitudinal stiffeners. The roof sheath carries purlins that are stored on truss trusses. The design is made of S 235 strength steel. The computational program Scia Engineer was used for the design and subsequent assessment of the steel structure. To calculate the details, the IDEA StatiCA computational program was used. The total length of the exhibition gallery is 60 m, width 45 m (30 + 15 m). The ridge height at the top is 12. 46 m...|$|R
50|$|The hull, {{deck and}} {{deckhouse}} are of welded marine aluminium alloy, with <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> and longitudinals. Integral double bottom tanks contain fuel {{with an additional}} gravity fuel tank at the center. The hull is divided into six watertight compartments which meet strict international flooded damage stability criteria.|$|R
30|$|The load–displacement curves were {{identical}} for the 2 D and 3 D specimens up to a vertical displacement of 18  mm. Because the flexural and arching {{actions of the}} in-plane beams are dominant during this stage, this similarity is obvious. Numerical analyses {{in the next section}} demonstrate that within this stage, small axial forces were developed in the transverse beam. Generally, owing to the lack of axial restraint in the transverse beam, arching actions could not develop. Hence, flexural action is the dominant mechanism in the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame.</b> The flexural capacity of a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> leads to higher resistance for 3 D specimen events – in the post peak phase of the load–displacement curve (Fig.  11). The area under the load–displacement curve for the 3 D specimen is 1.9 times larger than the corresponding value for the 2 D assembly.|$|E
30|$|Figure  6 {{shows the}} failure {{pattern of the}} frame model. Due to the entire failure of the <b>{{transverse}}</b> <b>frame</b> beam and the transverse direction of the frame slabs in the failure zone, {{the effect of the}} transverse beam and the transverse direction of the slabs can be ignored, while calculating the progressive collapse resistance of the whole structure at a collapse limit state.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{solution}} of a longstanding internal problem of noncommutative geometry, namely the computation of the index of a transversally elliptic operator on an arbitrary foliation. The new and crucial ingredient is a certain Hopf algebra associated to the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> bundle. Its cyclic cohomology is defined and shown to be canonically isomorphic to the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology. Comment: 54 page...|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{results in the}} present study demonstrate the significant role of <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> in the redistribution of unbalanced loads resulting from a column removal scenario. With RC moment frames, a consideration of the redistribution of unbalanced loads in all directions leads to more economical and precise design.|$|R
50|$|R100 {{was built}} {{suspended}} {{from the roof of}} its shed. The individual <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> were assembled horizontally then lifted up and slung from roof-mounted trackways before being slid into position and attached to the adjacent frames by the longitudinal girders. The ship remained suspended until the gasbags were inflated with hydrogen.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Ardent {{was built}} using {{longitudinal}} framing rather than conventional <b>transverse</b> <b>framing.</b> She was laid {{down under the}} 1911 - 1912 construction programme by William Denny & Brothers Limited and launched on 8 September 1913.

40|$|This work {{contains}} the basic hypothesis used for developing an expert system to synthesize automatically the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> of ship structure. The system is composed by a Finite Element module, a Graphic Display module and a User Friendly Data Entry and Management Module. It {{can be used}} for synthesis or for analysis of ship structures or any two-dimensional frame structure as well. The Finite Element module has in its library spar, beam and shear elements. With the last one is possible to calculate the primary shear stress among the ship cross section. The Graphic Display module can plot the model characteristics as mesh, loads, boundary conditions and the results as deformed shape, stress and force diagrams. The system was used to synthesize a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> for ship structure that was former designed and optimized by using three-dimensional finite element model. The results are similar but with one significant difference: the time dispensed by the using the synthesis system, few hours, is much less than the days spent by using three-dimensional models...|$|E
30|$|The {{progressive}} {{collapse of the}} structure occurs only in the bay where the removal side column is located. Also, {{due to the lack}} of lateral support or constraint, the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> beam and the transverse direction of the frame slabs in the collapse area almost entirely failed in the collapse limit state. Greater catenary action and tensile membrane action are respectively mobilized in the longitudinal frame beams and the longitudinal direction of the frame slabs.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} reconstructing the C- 12 (p,p') C- 12 *(1 dagger) amplitudes in the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> (without using {{phase-shift}} analysis) is suggested. We show that by supplementing the eight existing measurements on C- 12 (p,p') C- 12 *(1 dagger) with a carefully chosen set of measurements on C- 12 (p,p'gamma) C- 12, {{it is possible}} to determine the scattering amplitudes, completely free from discrete ambiguities. We also provide alternative equivalent sets, which may be employed depending on the experimental constraints, to determine the amplitudes...|$|E

50|$|PT-617 is a PT-103-class ELCO motor torpedo boat. The hull was {{constructed}} of {{two layers of}} mahogany planking laid diagonally over laminated spruce, white oak, and mahogany frames, reinforced with longitudinal battens, secondary <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> and clamps. A layer of fabric, impregnated with marine glue, was laid between the two layers of planking.|$|R
50|$|In {{longitudinal}} <b>framing,</b> {{very heavy}} <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> are spaced much further apart than in traditional framing - about 12 ft A {{large number of}} longitudinal frames are then attached to hold the shell plating. The longitudinal frames at the sides fit into notches cut into the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> while the ones {{near the bottom of}} the ship are sometimes made continuous between transverse bulkheads. The transverses are connected to the shell plating at heavy angles and with a tank top are cut at the margin plate. Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the tank top plating. Under the tank top, except for notches cut for the bottom and tank top longitudinals, the transverses are much like ordinary floor plates. The deck longitudinals furnish ample strength, even when large hatch openings must be accommodated.|$|R

50|$|Diesel fuel was {{contained}} in tanks in the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> {{the majority of}} the tanks having a capacity of 224 imp gal. A mechanism was provided for dumping fuel directly from the tanks in an emergency. By the use of tankage provided for weight compensation when travelling with a light passenger load a total fuel load of 10000 imp gal could be carried.|$|R
50|$|Scott {{also contributed}} to the design of {{airships}} themselves; with R101 designer Colonel Vincent Richmond, he was responsible for that ship's novel unbraced <b>transverse</b> <b>frames.</b> In collaboration with Richmond or with the designer's assistant, Michael Rope, Scott was awarded patents for the frame design and for other features of the ship, including the wires that restrained its gasbags, its gas valves and its internally located passenger accommodation.|$|R
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} transverse beams, a 3 D sub-assemblage including three columns, three beams and a middle column stub is tested in the present study. Due to the probable complexities, a 3 / 10 -scaled specimen is used here. The 3 D specimen {{is an extension of}} a planar (2 D) sub-assemblage that was tested separately by Ahmadi et al. (2016) and the results will be used to provide {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the transverse beam. The 2 D specimen includes two end columns, a middle column stub and two beams. To make a 3 D specimen, a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> consisting of a beam and an end column is added at the middle joint. The specimens were fastened to a displacement control point loaded above the column; the test continued until complete failure of the specimen. During testing, corresponding displacements and strains at predefined points and sections were measured and the formation of resistance mechanisms and failure modes were recorded.|$|E
30|$|No similar {{tests for}} {{calibrating}} a numerical model {{have been presented}} in {{the wide range of}} literature on the experimental study of progressive collapse that has been reviewed. Because of this deficiency, the tests performed in the present study, as well as the 2 D full-scale laboratory tests by Lew et al. (2011), have been used to calibrate the numerical models. Two specimens representative of Intermediate Moment Frames (IMF) and Special Moment Frames (SMF) were designed and tested under monotonic downward loading by Lew et al. (2011). The IMF model specimen N 1 is used for a parametric study in Sect.  4.4. The 2 D and 3 D specimens are the subject of the experimental work in this study. These specimens were identical in dimensions and detailing, but the 3 D specimen had an additional <b>transverse</b> <b>frame.</b> The characteristics of these two specimens were identical and reported in the specimen detail in Sect.  2.|$|E
40|$|Post-tensioned {{segmental}} concrete box girders {{have been in}} use in the United States since the early 1970 s. This unique bridge system uses post-tensioning to connect many smaller concrete bridge segments into very efficient long span bridges. However, because of the slender components, localized transverse bending becomes more critical when compared to more conventional bridge types. Bridge owners are finding that ratings for standard loads and permit trucks are often controlled by the transverse behavior of the girders near concentrated wheel loads. The popular analysis methods used today range from two dimensional frame models to three dimensional finite element models of the entire bridge. Currently, engineers must make sound engineering judgments on limited available information, while balancing safety and economy. To quantify and understand longitudinal and transverse behavior, the results from three live load tests of single cell {{segmental concrete}} box girder bridges are presented. Each bridge was instrumented with longitudinal and transverse strain sensors {{on at least two}} cross sections as well as rotation and deflection sensors, when possible.
