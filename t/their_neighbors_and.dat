5|$|The {{following}} month they traveled east, hoping {{to locate the}} Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> <b>and</b> {{the location of the}} Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E

25|$|The Natchez chiefdom was {{destroyed}} in the 1730s by the French; Natchez speakers took refuge among <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> accompanied {{them when they were}} eventually driven to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. That meant that Natchez speakers were frequently multilingual in Creek, Cherokee, Natchez, and English, and the language gradually became endangered, and it is now generally considered extinct in spite of recent revitalization efforts. What is known of the language comes mostly from its last fluent speakers, Watt Sam and Nancy Raven, who worked with linguist Mary R. Haas in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Starting in April 2005, she and {{her family}} spent a year making every effort to eat food {{produced}} as locally as possible. Living on their farm in rural Virginia, they grew much of their own food, and obtained most of the rest from <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> other local farmers. Kingsolver, her husband and her elder daughter chronicled their experiences that year in the book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle. Although exceptions were made for staple ingredients which were not available locally, such as coffee and olive oil, the family grew vegetables, raised livestock, made cheese and preserved much of their harvest.|$|E
25|$|From their {{principal}} settlements {{in cities like}} Byblos, Tyre and Sidon, the Phoenicians began to expand their trade influence to <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> {{among the first to}} bring wine to Egypt. From there they expanded from beyond mere trading to establishing colonies of trading cities throughout the Mediterranean. They continued along the southern shores to found Carthage in 814 BC in northern Africa, and from there to the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula. The Phoenicians were the founders of Málaga and Cádiz in present-day Spain sometime in the 9th century, though a small outpost may have been established even earlier.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or {{simply because they}} want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E
25|$|The Washington conference {{concluded}} in February with {{the adoption of}} the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1923, which had eleven supplemental conventions. The treaty in many ways followed the provisions of the 1907 treaty. The Central American court was reorganized, reducing the influence of the various governments over its membership. The clause providing for withholding recognition of revolutionary governments was expanded to preclude recognition of any revolutionary leader, his relatives, or anyone who had been in power six months before or after such an uprising unless the individual's claim to power had been ratified by free elections. The governments renewed their pledges to refrain from aiding revolutionary movements against <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> to seek peaceful resolutions for all outstanding disputes.|$|E
25|$|By the 15th century AD, {{the farming}} Bakongo people (ba being the plural prefix) were unified as the Kingdom of Kongo under a ruler called the manikongo, {{residing}} in the fertile Pool Malebo area on the lower Congo River. The capital was M'banza-Kongo. With superior organization, {{they were able to}} conquer <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the manikongo. Later, maize (corn) and cassava (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at Luanda and Benguela. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing millet as a main staple.|$|E

40|$|In Ad hoc {{networks}} every node {{plays an}} important part in the transmission of packets from sender to receiver. Most of the time packet delivery ratio of these networks depends on the behavior of intermediate nodes. Sometimes these intermediate nodes cooperate and forward the packets of <b>their</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>and</b> some time they simply drop their packets <b>and</b> cheat <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> We present a solution that not only detect these selfish nodes but also punish these nodes so that they avoid such misbehavior in future. To this account, we use an agent “Neighbor Monitor”, running on every node, to monitor the traffic of <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> assign a value called “Reputation Index”, associated with each node, based on its behavior...|$|R
25|$|There {{seemed very}} {{little hope of}} native Christians {{receiving}} anything through the instrumentality of their officials, nor did the foreign powers think they were called upon to provide indemnity for these. All {{the survivors of the}} churches were reduced to absolute poverty. They were harmless, inoffensive people who had no feuds with <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> had not intruded their religion on any one. This at least was true of the Protestant Christians. If a missionary, by means of his personal influence and by the assistance of the local official who might be friendly to him, could bring the neighbors of his persecuted people to see the error of their ways, and persuade them to contribute money for the rebuilding of destroyed houses and for the support of the survivors of the families, I think he was justified in so doing.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E
25|$|Rosen {{gives an}} {{overview}} of Jewish participation in the Confederate States Army (CSA) during the American Civil War of 1861–1865, and their attachment to the extant Confederate States of America. Even though Jews were only 2,000 out of 1 million members of the CSA, Rosen shows that both Sephardi Jews, {{who had been in}} the South for a long time, and Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom were immigrants from Prussia, joined the Confederacy alongside <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> served honorably. While the book mentions well-known Jewish Confederates like Judah P. Benjamin, David Levy Yulee, Abraham Myers and Phoebe Pember, and lesser known Jewish Confederates like Henry M. Hyams, Benjamin F. Jonas, Adolph Proskauer and Alexander Hart, it is also full of vignettes about the lives of ordinary Southern Jewish families who sent their sons to the war front, as well as their daughters and mothers, who often acted as Confederate informants.|$|E

25|$|An urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in {{the heart}} of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya. The Garamantes {{achieved}} this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> <b>and</b> capturing many slaves (who were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes' capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes' territory. The Garamantes' civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.|$|E
