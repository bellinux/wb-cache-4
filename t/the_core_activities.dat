30|$|First, a {{subsistence}} <b>activity</b> {{is either}} <b>core</b> or auxiliary {{depending on the}} physiographic areas (i.e. coastal plains, high mountains, high plateaux, interior valleys and interior plains), their resource endowments, climactic condition and access to alternative livelihood opportunities outside the pastoralists' primary residential domain. I schematically illustrate the alternation between subsistence activities by comparing mostly herding and fishing while neglecting a miscellany of other activities: On the coastal plains, fishing is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity,</b> while date cultivation and herding are auxiliary ones. Also, for a proportion of the coastal population, especially in the north, salaried employment is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with trading as an auxiliary activity, and where the cultivation of dates is an un-remunerative tradition-bound endeavour, and fishing is either an occasional leisure, or supplementary income, activity. In the high mountains, herding is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with negligible participation in auxiliary activities such as date cultivation. In the high plateau areas, herding is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> supplemented, in <b>the</b> central region, by date cultivation and the collection of resin from incense-bearing trees, and in the western region, some pastoralists migrate toward the southwestern coast for seasonal fishing. In the internal valleys, herding is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with date cultivation as an auxiliary one, but assumes core status seasonally. In the internal plains, herding is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>activity,</b> which is seasonally complemented by fishing on the northern coast as the auxiliary activity. However, <b>the</b> subsistence <b>activities,</b> whether <b>core</b> or auxiliary, in all the island's areas are regulated by the seasonal calendar, and in particular by the occurrence of monsoon winds and seasonal rains.|$|R
