40|$|Mapping of virus-specific nuclear {{transcripts}} {{was carried}} out in three lines of rat cells transformed by SV 40. Each of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines contained a single copy of integrated viral DNA with identified regions adjacent to cell DNA (1). The main virus-specific nuclear transcript in all of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines was shown to be complementary to the minus strand of the early region in SV 40 genome. Each cell nucleus contained approximately 50 copies of these RNAs. Transcripts complementary to both strands of the late region in viral genome were also detectable in all of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Its content varied depending on the cell line and was 20 - 50 -fold less than that of the main virus-specific transcript.

5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. <b>These</b> <b>cells</b> migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of <b>these</b> <b>cells</b> through the release of proteins known as BMPs. <b>These</b> <b>cells</b> then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E

40|$|We have {{established}} 3 cell lines ORL- 48, - 115 and - 136 from surgically resected specimens obtained from untreated primary human oral squamous cell carcinomas {{of the oral}} cavity. The in vitro growth characteristics, epithelial origin, in vitro anchorage independency, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, microsatellite instability status, karyotype {{and the status of}} various cell cycle regulators and gatekeepers of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines were investigated. All 3 cell lines grew as monolayers with doubling times ranging between 26. 4 and 40. 8 h and were immortal. Karyotyping confirmed that <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines were of human origin with multiple random losses and gains of entire chromosomes and regions of chromosomes. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the epithelial origin of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines, and the low degree of anchorage independency expressed by <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines suggests non-transformed phenotypes. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the p 53 gene in all cell lines and hypermethylation of p 16 INK 4 a in ORL- 48 and - 136. Analysis of MDM 2 and EGFR expression indicated MDM 2 overexpression in ORL- 48 and EGFR overexpression in ORL- 136 in comparison to the protein levels in normal oral keratinocytes. Analysis of the BAT- 26 polyadenine repeat sequence and MLH- 1 and MSH- 2 repair enzymes demonstrated that all 3 cell lines were microsatellite stable. The role of HPV in driving carcinogenesis in these tumours was negated by the absence of HPV. Finally, analysis of the tissues from which <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines were derived indicated that the cell lines were genetically representative of the tumours, and, therefore, are useful tools in the understanding of the molecular changes associated with oral cancers. ...|$|R

5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body.

Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. <b>These</b> <b>cells,</b> termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. <b>These</b> <b>cells</b> provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism.

The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) offer new avenues for studying human development and disease progression {{in addition to their}} tremendous potential toward development of cell-replacement therapies for various cellular disorders. We have earlier reported the derivation and characterization of Relicell® hES 1, the first fully characterized hESC line generated from the Indian subcontinent. Recent studies have demonstrated discrete differences among hESC lines, in terms of both their growth properties and their differentiation propensity. To address some of these issues in the context of hESC research in India, we have recently generated two new hESC lines: Relicell® hES 2 and Relicell®hES 3. Both <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines were derived using a combinatorial approach of immunosurgery followed by mechanical surgery for inner cell mass isolation. The cell lines exhibit the usual hESC characteristics including their ability to differentiate both in vitro and in vivo to yield the three germinal layers. Whole genome microarray analysis of <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines was compared with Relicell®hES 1 and it showed that approximately 9000 genes were expressed by these lines. As expected the expression pattern of <b>these</b> new <b>cell</b> lines bore close resemblance to that of Relicell®hES 1. A majority of the pluripotency genes and the genes known to inhibit various differentiation pathways were also expressed by <b>these</b> <b>cell</b> lines.
