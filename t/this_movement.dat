5|$|<b>This</b> <b>movement</b> was {{not part}} of Rossini's {{original}} version for two pianos and harmonium, but he inserted it in his version for orchestra. He transposed an earlier composition. It became customary to include it even in performances and editions with piano(s).|$|E
5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman {{as they do}} in many other languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, <b>this</b> <b>movement</b> occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of <b>this</b> <b>movement</b> came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of <b>this</b> <b>movement.</b> His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as his}} study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>movement's</b> melody is almost-exclusively in upwards or {{downwards}} appoggiatura-like scale fragments {{interspersed with}} punctuated, accented dissonances. However, the piece has a short, legato middle section in B-flat minor. A performance lasts about a minute.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>movement's</b> repeating bass {{immediately}} {{creates a}} sense of urgency until it opens up to a staccatoed and heavily-chordal melody that gradually grows in magnitude until one great final shove, after which the piece ends. A performance lasts just under a minute.|$|R
25|$|Latter Day Saints share {{a central}} belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. They accept his {{sacrifice}} {{as the only}} way to be saved. According to <b>this</b> <b>movement's</b> theology, that is the central message of the scriptures.|$|R
5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active member of <b>this</b> <b>movement,</b> he had close ties of friendship with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. <b>This</b> <b>movement</b> with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and <b>this</b> <b>movement</b> is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, {{hundreds}} of thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran, to protest the election outcome.

5|$|The {{conventional}} Mozartian coda {{concludes with}} an orchestral tutti and no written-out {{part for the}} soloist. In <b>this</b> <b>movement,</b> Mozart breaks with convention: the soloist interrupts the tutti with a virtuosic passage of sixteenth notes, and accompanies the orchestra through to the final pianissimo C-minor chords.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in 3/4 time, hitherto uncommon among Haydn's opening movements. In <b>this</b> <b>movement,</b> Haydn departs from the monothematic approach that characterises {{many of his}} other sonata form movements in the set. The exposition presents two clearly distinct themes: {{the first in the}} tonic and the second in the dominant.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme and}} its broken seventh chord (G-B-D-F) which {{characterize}} <b>this</b> <b>movement</b> is stated {{first as a}} major seventh in the two first passages of the first section A with a discreet accompaniment. To finish this section, the theme arpeggiates a dominant seventh. In the second A section, the theme first repeats the major seventh before developing into a minor seventh with a minor third in the second passage (G-B-D-F).|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>movement</b> is {{prompted}} by the feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. <b>This</b> <b>movement,</b> although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise <b>this</b> <b>movement.</b> As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of <b>this</b> <b>movement.</b> On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E

50|$|The finale {{relies heavily}} on {{chromatic}} scale figures and motor rhythms. From an orchestral standpoint, it {{is arguably the most}} complex movement. Penderecki uses an elaborate network of instrumental combinations, creating a dialogue of multiple orchestral colors as the finale unfolds. Much of <b>this</b> <b>movement's</b> melodic material utilizes the familiar tritone and chromatic scale.|$|R
50|$|However, next to {{the working-class}} {{socialism}} of Allemane, an intellectual socialist movement developed within the POSR, led by Lucien Herr, a librarian. <b>This</b> <b>movement's</b> priority was {{the education of the}} people. Overall, the POSR was a moderate reformist party, influenced by possibilism which believed that socialism could be achieved though democratic action, such as decentralization and legislative participation.|$|R
5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for <b>this</b> <b>movement</b> have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. <b>This</b> <b>movement</b> of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Borneo, {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo. <b>This</b> <b>movement</b> proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E

50|$|The Andante {{is written}} in the time {{signature}} of 6/8 time and consists of 129 bars; a typical performance would last just over six minutes. It repeats neither its exposition nor {{the remainder of the}} movement, which is unusual for Mozart's mature chamber music. A particularly recognizable feature of <b>this</b> <b>movement's</b> principal theme is the grupetto (turn) which appears throughout.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} highly inventive {{movement is}} a brilliant and animated allegro, a moto perpetuo. The busy semiquaver figure in the theme, passed constantly between {{different parts of the}} orchestra and the soloists, only adds to the overall sense of rhythmic and harmonic direction. Although superficially in concerto form, <b>this</b> <b>movement's</b> success is probably more a result of Handel's departure from convention.|$|R
