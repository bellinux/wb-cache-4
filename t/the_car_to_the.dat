5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, {{with the intent of}} improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal {{as much money as}} possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E

Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop {{the part of the}} road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

Its melody is built on a heavy electronic beat, and incorporates whistle registers and several studio-created synthesizers into its melody. Additionally, the song features the inclusion of Auto-Tune and several vocal manipulators, which are used heavily on both Carey and T-Pain's vocals. Lyrically, the song finds the singer during a night out, migrating from several locations: from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club, from the bar to the V.I.P, from the party to the after-party, and finally to the hotel. According to Brian Hiatt from VH1, she [...] "hops from my car into the club ... from the bar to VIP ... from the party to the after-party ... afterparty to hotel" [...] with T-Pain, who urges her to [...] "bounce, bounce, bounce." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Migrate" [...] is an up-tempo hip hop club track. Lyrically, it {{is about}} the freedom and {{independence}} of a girls' night out. It documents Carey's whereabouts and where she migrates from and to: [...] "from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club to the bar to the VIP lounge to the after-party to the hotel" [...] and contains a reference to Patrón, a brand of Mexican tequila. As the song is about movement from one place to another, T-Pain tells her to [...] "bounce" [...] in response. Carey displays a sense of [...] "confident, social forwardness" [...] on [...] "Migrate". Nick Levine of Digital Spy thought that Carey sounded her [...] "most diva-like" [...] on the song, with the references to champagne being [...] "compliments of the club" [...] while the DJ plays her [...] "jam". Melodically, Carey delivers the track over a [...] "repeating" [...] chorus backed by a [...] "descending echo-synth". It contains a reduced number of notes in order to further accentuate the hook. While Carey employs a [...] "sassy" [...] tone of voice, both her and T-Pain's vocals are processed with Auto-Tune. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic thought that the use of Auto-Tune on Carey's vocals served a [...] "dual purpose", and explained that while it [...] "camouflages her slightly diminishing range" [...] it also made her sound [...] "modern". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt that T-Pain sounded more interesting than Carey despite the use of Auto-Tune.|$|E

500|$|Rindt's {{best result}} came the {{following}} year at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American Masten Gregory for the North American Racing Team, Rindt won the event. Neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car. A 1998 article in Motor Sport stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race, but instead it was [...] "more a case of 'hope it breaks soon' so they could draw their money and split". At the start, the drivers had to run to their cars; Rindt entered with a forward roll {{that allowed him to}} get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead. The pair experienced considerable trouble {{in the early part of}} the race; the car did not restart during Gregory's first pit stop. Later, the engine failed partially and Gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders. At this point, Rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes, expecting their race to be over. After thirty minutes of repairs, the car restarted and Rindt and Gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event [...] "flat out", at full speed and with the accompanying risk. Rindt drove most of the night, advancing from 18th to third position by dawn. Gregory persuaded Rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race, suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish. Jacky Ickx later recalled that the two had driven [...] "like maniacs". Even so, the car survived, handing the pair what Ickx called an [...] "unexpected victory".|$|E
