Under the assumption of perfect competition in all markets, we show that if firms can substitute among pollutants, then setting the “optimal” number of permits for only one pollutant will not, in general, lead to an efficient outcome.

When establishing <b>transferable</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>rights</b> regulators should, therefore, consider the technology of firms. If firms discharge pollutants in the same fixed proportions, then the regulator need only set a market for one of the pollutants to ensure an efficient outcome. Where firms can substitute among pollutants, however, establishing a market for only one pollutant provides an incentive for firms to substitute to unregulated ones. This is an important policy issue as substitutability among pollutants within and across production processes may dampen the dynamic advantages of a tradeable permit policy.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to discuss the concept of {{cost-effectiveness}} of national air pollution abatement programmes, analyze it from a region-wide perspective, and outline a framework for integrating international and domestic environmental priorities. The paper refers to air protection policy priorities adopted {{by the government of}} Poland in 1990, and reviews policy instruments envisaged for their implementation. Additionally, it discusses international priorities and how the government of Poland attempts to address these in its policy. After defining cost-effectiveness, this paper reviews how the choice of policy instruments influences the costs of pollution control policy. Then, the recent Polish experience with charges, environmental funds, and transferable permits is confronted with the cost-effectiveness principles. The paper concludes that Poland has developed an extensive system of pollution fees which serves a revenue-raising purpose and gives modest incentives to abate, although the cost-effectiveness of this mechanism needs improvement. A potential role for transferable permits is emphasized.

In Chile, water pollution is a major problem. Until recently, existing regulations to control water pollution consisted mainly of non-market based instruments. Innovative instruments are now being explored via a recent national law for tradable emission/discharge permits. The instrument of tradable discharge permits {{is one of several}} market-based instruments used in water management and pollution control. Tradable discharge permits are actually among the most challenging market-based instruments in terms of both their design and implementation. Experience to date with tradable discharge permits for water pollution control has been limited and mainly comes from several regions of the US and Australia. The paper at first introduces tradable permits as part of an overall taxonomy of economic instruments in the field of water management. In this context, three fundamentally different fields of application of tradable permits systems relating to water are presented: tradable water abstraction rights, tradable rights to water-based resources and tradable water <b>pollution</b> <b>rights.</b> The remaining of the paper deals exclusively with the latter category, i. e. tradable water <b>pollution</b> <b>rights,</b> their role and applicability in water pollution control...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 : Tradable Permits under Environmental and Cost-reducing R&D: This chapter models {{simultaneous}} {{investments in}} both environmental and cost-reducing R&D by asymmetric Cournot duopolist. <b>Pollution</b> <b>rights</b> (emission permits) are allocated by the regulator {{and can be}} traded between firms. Both R&D competition and cooperation are considered. In a three-stage game, firms first invest in R&D, then trade permits, and then compete in output. The strategic interaction between different types of R&D investments is analyzed. It is found that giving more permits to one firm induces it to conduct more cost-reducing but less environmental R&D. The second-best optimal allocation of <b>pollution</b> <b>rights</b> is also analyzed. This allocation matters for social welfare under R&D competition, but is irrelevant under R&D cooperation. Moreover, the optimal allocation depends on R&D spillovers. This paper also studies the grandfathering of permits based on historical output. Compared with the second-best optimal allocation, the higher the emissions reduction level, the more likely that grandfathering allocates too few permits to the large firm and too many permits to the small firm. Adding an R&D budget constraint leads firms to under-invest in cost-reducing R&D relative to environmental R&D. Chapter 2 : Tradable Permits under Environmental R&D between Upstream and Downstream Industries: This chapter models the simultaneous investments in environmental R&D by both downstream and upstream industries, with two symmetric firms within each industry competing à la Cournot. <b>Pollution</b> <b>rights</b> are allocated by the regulator, and firms can trade permits. R&D competition, intra-industry (horizontal), inter-industry (vertical) and both intra- and inter-industry (generalized) R&D cooperations are considered. In a four-stage game, firms first invest in R&D, then trade permits, then upstream firms compete in intermediate good production, and finally downstream firms compete in final food production. The strategic interactions between R&D investments are analyzed. It is found that an increase in either vertical or horizontal R&D spillovers reduce the permit price but increase production, but the spillover effects on R&D investments are ambiguous and they depend {{on the number of}} permits that a firm receives from the government. However, firms undertake more R&D under generalized cooperation than vertical cooperation, irrespective of spillovers and the allocation of permits, and this results in higher social welfare under generalized cooperation than vertical cooperation. The optimal allocation of <b>pollution</b> <b>rights</b> by the regulator is also considered. This allocation matters for social welfare under R&D competition and horizontal cooperation, but is irrelevant under vertical and generalized cooperations. Chapter 3 : Is There a Principle of Targeting in Environmental Taxation?: This chapter studies whether the "principle of targeting", which is referred to by Dixit (1985) as the tax formulae for dirty goods have "additivity property" (Sandmo 1975) and externality-generating sources should be directly targeted (Bhagwati and Johnson 1960), can be applicable {{in the presence of a}} uniform commodity tax with an additional emissions tax. We consider three perfectly competitive markets, one of them produces a non-polluting good and the other two produce polluting goods. The regulator chooses optimal taxes on all three markets to maximize social welfare and finances an exogenous public expenditure. First all, it is found that the additivity property does not hold under differentiated taxes, and is even further weakened with a uniform commodity tax. It is also shown that the Pigouvian tax is unlikely to apply on the top of the uniform commodity tax. Furthermore, if there is only tax instrument available [...] i. e. either the uniform commodity tax or the emissions tax [...] then the uniform commodity tax (emissions tax) induces higher social welfare when marginal social damage is low (high) ...|$|R

40|$|When {{discussing}} {{tradable permit}} systems relating to water, three fundamentally different fields of application {{can be identified}} (Kraemer and Banholzer, 1999). Firstly tradable permits for water, or tradable water abstraction rights, {{can be used for}} quantitative water resource management. Secondly tradable discharge rights, or tradable water <b>pollution</b> <b>rights,</b> can be use to protect and manage (surface) water quality. Thirdly there are tradable permits to use or consume water- borne resources, such as fish or the potential energy of water at height. In this overview we concentrate on the second case; i. e. the use of tradable water <b>pollution</b> <b>rights.</b> Watershed based trading or effluent trading, allows a pollution source to buy controls or permits that will reduce the amount of a problem pollutant elsewhere in the watershed or drainage basin. By buying such controls, the factory does not need to install abatement technologies to lower the discharge of that pollutant for its own plant. Parties involved in the trade want to either: (a) trade directly with each other; or (b) create a market of 'credits' that represent a specific amount of pollutant reduction, as is currently done with trading air emission reductions. The intent of trading is to achieve an expected reduction of a particular pollutant at a lower cost. The challenge with trading is to allow for innovative, market-based reforms without compromising the existing safeguards in environmental protection (National Wildlife Federation, 1999). It is important to distinguish between two types of pollution sources: point and nonpoint sources. Point sources discharge from a defined route, such as a pipe. Nonpoint source, on the contrary, have diffuse discharges that enter a river or lake as runoff from a wide geographic area. Examples of this last category include runoff from agricultural fields, roads and parking lots. ...|$|R
