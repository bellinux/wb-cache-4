40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a single inventory (newsboy) problem in which <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> has {{a limited amount}} of funds to purchase items to sell. We assume that the manufacturer will either sell the items to <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> outright or offer the items to <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> on a revenue sharing (consignment) basis. In the latter case, that amount of money <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> pays per unit is less than if the items are purchased from <b>the</b> <b>vendor,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> must share some of the revenue with the manufacturer. The purpose of our analysis is to investigate under what circumstances, it would pay for <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> to only purchase the items from the manufacturer, only take the items on consignment from the manufacturer, or both purchase and take consignment shipments form the manufacturer...|$|R

25|$|In 1964, drummer Don Powell and guitarist Dave Hill {{were part}} of a Midland-based group called <b>the</b> <b>Vendors.</b> Regulars on the club circuit, they had also {{recorded}} a privately pressed four-track EP. At the time, Noddy Holder was playing guitar and contributing to vocals in Steve Brett & the Mavericks. Signed to Columbia Records, the band released three singles in 1965. After listening to American blues artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf, <b>the</b> <b>Vendors</b> decided on a change of direction and name: As the N Betweens they gained greater recognition and began to get supporting gigs with acts such as the Hollies, the Yardbirds, Georgie Fame and Spencer Davis.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} which <b>vendor</b> is cheating, <b>the</b> broker would request the InfoToB token (see message 3 in Section 5.5) that the client sends to <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> when he makes a payment. This token confirms the amount {{to be paid to}} <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> in <b>the</b> transaction and this information cannot be modified by <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> since it is signed using a symmetric key shared only between the client and the broker. Thus, from the InfoToB token received from each <b>vendor,</b> <b>the</b> broker can detect <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> that is cheating.|$|R

Moran Market, located in Seongnam, was the largest dog meat market in South Korea. Annually, it sold over 80,000 dogs and was the source for one-third of the dog meat consumption in country.

Naidu presents the scene of the music produced by traditional instruments played by the musicians and the chantings of the magicians, the various fruits being sold by the fruit-men, the weighing of saffron, lentils and rice by <b>the</b> <b>vendors,</b> and other depictions of different wares which are sold in the bazaar.

50|$|In Hong Kong, <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> is {{generally}} only required {{to prove his}} title up to 15 {{years prior to the}} date of the sale and purchase.

25|$|Although the SAM {{supported}} commerce, by arranging products by type {{rather than}} by brand it helped visitors compare features and prices. The Salon organizers tried to impose some degree of uniformity on the display stands, but there was naturally competition by <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> to attract attention through taller and more original stands. To counteract this, all displays had to meet standards and be approved by a committee. There was some social segregation. The displays of inexpensive small items in the basement from 1956 tended to be fairly chaotic, with visitors {{able to pick up}} and examine the products, while the booths upstairs showing the larger and more expensive items were calmer and more elegant.|$|E
25|$|Shopping on {{this day}} begin very early as this is when there is the best selection. However, not all of <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> on Sunday sell second hand items. Building One, the {{clothing}} section, is expanded by vendors who also sell clothes. While there is a notable presence of vintage clothing sellers {{on this day}}, most sell new and current fashions, many knock-offs of major designers. Stalls change merchandise frequently and currents modes of fashion can easily be seen from these stalls. One example was the proliferation of Indian style clothing which was popular in the mid 2000s in the city. There are also vendors selling other things related to fashion, such as henna tattoos and custom fingernail work.|$|E
25|$|Economically, all trading {{activities}} were sternly guarded, {{and the majority}} of the factories were taken over by the Imperial Japanese. Having deprived <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> and banks of their possessions, the occupying forces outlawed the Hong Kong Dollar and replaced it with the Japanese Military Yen. The exchange rate was fixed at 2 Hong Kong dollars to one military yen in January 1942. Later, the yen was re-valued at 4 Hong Kong dollars to a yen in July 1942, which meant local people could exchange fewer military notes than before. While the citizens of Hong Kong became poor in forced exchanges, the Imperial Japanese government sold the Hong Kong Dollar to help finance their war-time economy. Later, the yen was made the sole legal tender for official purposes in June 1943. Prices of commodities for sale had to be marked in yen. Hyper-inflation then disrupted the economy, directly affecting Hong Kong citizens. Enormous devaluation of the Imperial Japanese Military Yen after the war made it almost worthless.|$|E

30|$|Another {{possible}} {{attack that}} the client could try is to obtain <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> master key in order to eavesdrop other communications between <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> and other clients. There are two possible ways to obtain it. First, by eavesdropping <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> registration process, since in this process <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> sends master keys to the broker. However, the communication is ciphered. Second, from a client key, calculating the master key by brute force or finding collisions in the hash function (SHA- 2) used in the HMAC. But these attacks are not possible if we suppose perfect cryptography.|$|R
50|$|Vendor finance {{is a form}} of lending {{in which}} a company lends money to be used by the {{borrower}} to buy <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> products or property. Vendor finance is usually in the form of deferred loans from, or shares subscribed by, <b>the</b> <b>vendor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vendor</b> often takes shares in the borrowing company. This category of finance is generally used where <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> expectation of <b>the</b> value of the business is higher than that of the borrower's bankers, and usually at a higher interest rate than would be offered elsewhere.|$|R
