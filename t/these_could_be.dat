5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. <b>These</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> launched from a D1H catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted {{on either side of}} the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.|$|E

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> volunteers from the local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children. An executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, {{and a number of}} other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders and Section Leaders also form part of the committee. Their role is to ensure that the best interests of the young people and the community are served by the group, district, county, or national levels of the association.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. <b>These</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. <b>These</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E

5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> written {{as many times as}} necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Most {{taxes were}} due on {{each year on}} 1 September, and levied from {{individual}} landowners by decuriones (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect. Diocletian's reforms also {{increased the number of}} financial officials in the provinces: more rationales and magistri privatae are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes in gold, and the Imperial properties. Fluctuations {{in the value of the}} currency made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account. In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of capita and iuga.|$|E

5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would {{lay the groundwork}} for the modern Soviet air force and the industry that would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered that the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was {{a major problem for}} the residents in Broome. Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> set before the mission; the altitude {{of the target}} above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} {{objections to the}} process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that <b>these</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the pounding of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. <b>These</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not a war of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E
