5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E

5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E

This consists of either a rubber or plastic gasket fitted into <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> door and protruding up or down a short distance, or else a small metal plate with a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> it welded to <b>the</b> inside of the door through which <b>the</b> rod extends <b>in</b> any position.|$|R

During the battle, the ship suffered only minor damage; Helgoland {{was hit by a}} single 15-inch shell, but sustained minimal damage. Nevertheless, dry-docking was required to repair <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belt armor. Work was completed by 16 June. In the course of the battle, Helgoland had fired 63 main battery shells, and 61 rounds from her 15cm guns.|$|E
5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since {{the death of her}} second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called <b>The</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wall.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop {{two of the three}} pumps.|$|E

5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested {{and the results were}} inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into the area of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E

5|$|The Ryder Cup is contested in a {{match play}} format, which {{involves}} different {{methods of the}} format. A foursomes match is contested with two members from each team playing alternate shots. A fourball match consists of two players from either team, who each play their own shot throughout the round. The player that completes <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowest number of shots wins the hole. Singles matches are also played, with players from each team contesting a one-on-one match. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, if a match is tied after 18 holes then each team is awarded a ½ point. The format of the competition has changed throughout its history. Originally, foursome matches were played one day, with singles matches over 36 holes the next. Since 1979, the format has consisted of 28 matches held over three days, with each match worth a point. The first two days consist of eight matches; four foursomes and four fourball matches. The final day sees all 12 members of each team competing in singles matches.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{televised}} {{contest of}} Bound for Glory was the Steel Asylum {{to determine the}} number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. There were ten participants in this contest; those involved were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and Super Eric. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave to the ring, while SoCal Val accompanied Dutt. In this encounter, the ring was surrounded by a large red steel cage that domed with a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling. The objective was for a competitor to fight up the walls of the cage and escape via <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center. The first person to complete the task won the match and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. The duration of the bout was 12 minutes and 7 seconds. After several minutes of fighting among one another, several wrestlers attempted to climb the cage but were stopped. At one point, Devine performed his signature Devine Intervention maneuver on Rave, with Rave landing awkwardly on his neck. The winner of the contest was Lethal, who climbed the cage and escaped through the hole while everyone was preoccupied.|$|E

25|$|A {{pit latrine}} {{generally}} {{consists of three}} major parts: {{a hole in the}} ground, a slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is often known as an outhouse. The pit is typically at least 3meters (10feet) deep and 1m (3.2 feet) across. The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from groundwater and surface water should be as large as possible to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floor when not in use. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.|$|E
