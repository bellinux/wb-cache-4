40|$|Exophthalmos and eyelid {{retraction}} {{are typical}} symptoms of many orbital or systemic diseases, Graves' orbitopathy being the commonest. Independently from the cause, both may increase evaporation with drying of the ocular surfaces resulting in pain, tearing, and photophobia. The structural {{integrity of the}} cornea may also be damaged with possible compromise of the visual function. Acute onset of exophthalmos and/or eyelid retraction deserves maximum attention. In order to avoid corneal decompensation and waiting for a more definitive treatment, eye lubricants, moisture chambers, swimming goggles, temporary <b>tarsorrhaphies</b> or blepharorrhaphies represent the measures of choice.

Methods: Twenty eyes in 19 patients underwent the procedure with use of mitomycin; 15 eyes had primary and 5 had recurrent pterygia. These were compared with a previous group of 28 eyes in 26 patients that underwent pterygium/tarsorrhaphy surgery without use of mitomycin; 20 eyes had primary and 8 had recurrent pterygia. Postoperatively, all eyes in both groups were treated with dexamethasone/antibiotic drops. Results: In the mitomycin group, with an average follow-up of 12. 1 months, 19 eyes healed uneventfully; {{there have been no}} recurrences. The nonmitomycin group, with an average follow-up of 42. 6 months, has had nine recurrences (32 %); four required a second procedure. Recurrence was significantly lower in the mitomycin group (P =. 006). Conjunctival healing, as reflected in the time from surgery until <b>tarsorrhaphy</b> opening, was significantly delayed in the mitomycin group, 36. 7 versus 17 days (P =. 001).

The neurotrophic state was developed following keratoplasty (four eyes), herpes zoster ophthalmicus (four eyes), diabetes mellitus (four eyes), radiation (two eyes), removal of acoustic neuroma with neuroparalysis (one eye), and herpes simplex keratitis (one eye). â¨RESULTSâDuring a mean follow up period of 18. 8 Â (SD 13. 0) months, one to three layers of amniotic membrane with or without additional membrane as a patch were used for 17 Â procedures in 16 Â eyes for persistent neurotrophic corneal ulcers.

This condition can be treated by a range of techniques, including <b>tarsorrhaphy,</b> facial slings, and canthopexies. Gold plates provide a solution for temporary or permanent lagophthalmos resulting from facial paralysis. This study discusses the use of gold plates {{in the treatment of}} lagophthalmos but with the introduction of gold plates in two different positions in the upper lids. Methods: Group 1 (38 eyes) had a low level of placement (2 mm from the lid margin) of gold plates, while Group 2 (23 eyes) had a high level of placement (5 mm from the lid margin). Results: Noticeable bulge was seen in 18. 4 % of Group 1 eyes compared with 13 % in Group 2, and migration of the plate occurred in 2. 6 % and 0 % of eyes in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, as well as ptosis (7. 8 % and 4. 3 %) and conjunctival perforation (0 % and 4. 3 %). The degree of improvement of eyelid closure, keratopathy, and visual acuity were the same for both techniques.

40|$|AIM:To {{study the}} effect of {{different}} surgeries for vision and postoperative complications in leprosy patients with lagophthalmos. METHODS: A retrospective analysis. Totally 68 leprosy patients(97 eyes) with lagophthalmos were selected who treated with different surgeries during May 2007 to September 2015 in our sanatorium.

RESULTS: The effect on BCVA of patients treated with nylon thread correction surgery and tarsorrhaphy: the preoperative and postoperative BCVA was significantly different of the two groups(Z =- 4. 193, - 4. 213; P Z =- 1. 532, P > 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine whether antigenic presence on the ocular surface might directly influence the development or expression of the lacrimal secretory immune system. Experiments were designed to: (i) analyse the temporal accumulation of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-containing cells in lacrimal tissue during postnatal development (6 - 27 days of age); (ii) examine whether prevention of antigenic exposure to the ocular surface by unilateral <b>tarsorrhaphy</b> might inhibit lymphocyte immigration into the ipsilateral gland during development; and (iii) assess whether a non-invasive antigen, after placement on the ocular surface of infant or adult rats, undergoes retrograde transfer to the lacrimal gland. Our results demonstrated that: (i) the accumulation of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-containing cells in lacrimal tissue was most pronounced during the 6 -day period after eyelid opening (15 days of age). The pattern of appearance of these Ig-containing cells, which were predominantly IgA-positive, was identical in both left and right lacrimal glands. (ii) Closure of the left lid by <b>tarsorrhaphy</b> from 10 to 18 days of age had no effect on the accumulation of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-containing cells in the left lacrimal tissue compared to cell numbers in the right gland. (iii) Following placement of radiolabelled albumin on the ocular surface, antigen was almost completely cleared within 1 - 2 hr. Analysis of lacrimal glands showed no significant accumulation of radioactivity at any time-point, either in the presence or absence of ocular inflammation. In contrast, up to 17. 8 % of radioactivity was found in the stomach 1 - 2 hr following topical antigen application. Overall, our results show that a rapid development of the lacrimal secretory immune system occurs between 15 and 21 days of age.
