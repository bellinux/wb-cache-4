5|$|In October 1166, Becket ordered Robert and Roger of Worcester {{to attend}} him in France, {{so they could}} give him {{guidance}} on his dispute with the king. When they informed the king of <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> journey he forbade them to leave England. Nevertheless, they attempted to sneak {{out of the country}} in February 1167. They were apprehended on 2February, and ordered to remain in England not only in the king's name, but also in Alexander's.|$|E
5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.|$|E

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|Space telescopes were {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1923.

When finally launched in 1990, Hubble's main mirror {{was found to have}} been ground incorrectly, compromising the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> quality by a servicing mission in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

5|$|In rough {{seas and}} under enemy fire, the commandos began {{disembarking}} at Jig, some distance east of <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> position, at 09:50. Five of their LCAs were sunk by beach obstacles or enemy fire, {{at the cost}} of 76 casualties. Major P. M. Donnell temporarily took charge until Phillips and some others who had got separated from the unit rejoined the group at 14:00 along the Meuvaines–Le Carrefour road. The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so they dug in for the night. The town and port were captured in the battle of Port-en-Bessin on 7–8 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, partly as a {{response}} to criticism that they were not reaching <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students. Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program. In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was {{designed}} to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship, theoretically offering the ability to scout ahead {{of the group and}} locate targets for the smaller ships to attack. They were enlarged and more powerfully armed versions of the earlier ships, fitted with steam turbines. Curiously, they were no faster than the older ships and equally unsuccessful in <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> role as they lacked the speed of the destroyers they were supposed to escort.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Occupied Belgium {{was also}} {{targeted}} by the Allied bombers from both the British RAF and American USAAF. The policy led to high civilian casualties as bombs missed <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> targets and fell on civilian areas. In a raid on the Erla Motor Works in the Belgian town of Mortsel (near Antwerp) in April 1943, just two bombs dropped by the B-17s of the U.S. 8th Air Force fell on the intended target. The remaining 24 tons of bombs fell on civilian areas of the town, killing 936 and injuring 1,600 more in just eight minutes. The Allied policy was condemned by many leading figures within Belgium, including Cardinal van Roey.|$|E

5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E
5|$|The Burnley {{board had}} planned {{a tour of}} Spain to take place {{during the summer of}} 1921 after the {{culmination}} of the league campaign. However, the trip had to be cancelled when the club received notice from the Spanish Football Federation that one of <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> opponents, Barcelona, had been suspended from all matches. Further tours of Norway and France were then arranged, but these also had to be abandoned after the Football Association refused to grant permission. At {{the end of the season}} five players were given free transfers by the club; Len Smelt and Frank Birchenough, who had both played for Burnley during the campaign, and three reserve players. Moreover, two players–Bert Freeman and George Thompson–were placed on the transfer list by the manager.|$|E
5|$|The E60s were {{successful}} in the coal-hauling role. They ran on the BM for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in the Western United States. The passenger variants failed in <b>their</b> <b>intended</b> role. Problems with the truck design caused derailments above , rendering the locomotives unusable for high-speed service. By {{the end of the}} 1970s Amtrak abandoned the E60 in favor of EMD AEM-7 locomotives manufactured by Electro-Motive Division. In Mexico, the NdeM's project was delayed into the 1990s, then scrapped after three years of use. Most of the NdeM's electric locomotives never ran and were traded back to GE for diesels. Some were sold to various mining railroads.|$|E
