5000|$|When a draft {{promises}} immediate {{payment to}} the holder of the draft, {{it is called}} a sight draft. Cheques written on demand deposits are examples of sight drafts.

50|$|An {{acceptance}} credit {{is a type}} of letter of credit that is paid by a <b>time</b> <b>draft</b> authorizing payment on or after a specific date, if the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with. There are two types of {{acceptance credit}}, confirmed and unconfirmed. Unconfirmed acceptance credit means that the seller takes the risk that payment will not be made, due to any number of contingencies such as shipment non-delivery, confiscation by customs authorities, or any other problems. Confirmed acceptance credit means that the bank upon which the credit has been issued, essentially guarantees payment as long as the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with.|$|E
5000|$|Banker's {{acceptances}} make {{a transaction}} between two parties {{who do not}} know each other safer, because they allow the parties to substitute the bank's credit worthiness for that who owes the payment. They are used widely in international trade for payments that are due for a future shipment of goods and services. For example, an importer may draft a banker's acceptance when it does not have a close relationship with and cannot obtain credit from an exporter. Once the importer and bank have completed an acceptance agreement, whereby the bank accepts liabilities of the importer and the importer deposits funds at the bank (enough for the future payment plus fees), the importer can issue a <b>time</b> <b>draft</b> to the exporter for a future payment with the bank's guarantee.|$|E

Before acceptance, the draft {{is not an}} obligation of the bank; it is merely an order by the drawer to the bank to pay a specified sum of money on a specified date to a named person or to the bearer of the draft. Upon acceptance, which occurs when an authorized bank employee stamps the draft “accepted ” and signs it, the draft becomes a primary and unconditional liability of the bank. If the bank is well known and enjoys a good reputation, the accepted draft may be readily sold in an active market. 1.

Economists have long argued that compulsory military service amounts to a hidden tax on soldiers. American conscripts were paid poorly while in the military and lost valuable labor-market experience relative to their civilian counterparts (Walter Oi, 1967). On the other hand, some social scientists see military service as a possible leg up, even for draftees, primarily because of the generous GI Bill schooling benefits available t...|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} analyses {{the rules}} {{on the creation of}} security rights contained in the (at the <b>time)</b> <b>Draft</b> UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions. It first presents the basic general assumptions on which such rules are based and then offers an assessment of their compatibility with existing European secured transactions regimes, with particular regard to the prevailing approach found in continental legal systems. A number of specific issues are dealt with: differentiation between “attachment” (effectiveness inter partes) and “perfection” (effectiveness as against third parties); the influence of a “notice-filing system” as opposed to a “transaction-based system” of registration; the recognition of title-based security devices; the need to provide rules for acquisition security rights and retention of title instruments (with a comparative discussion of existing national and uniform models). The conclusion is that the UNCITRAL rules on the creation of security rights over movables not only are compatible with modern European legal systems, but, in addition, should be considered a good model for a future common European secured transactions' law, since they represent a marked improvement in efficiency with respect to more traditionally oriented solutions.

40|$|The {{focal point}} of this {{dissertation}} is the novel The Big House (La Casa Grande) by Álvaro Cepeda Samudio (1926 - 1972) a Colombian journalist,novelist, short storywriter, and filmmaker.

Waiting (Todos estábamos a la espera). In his novel he def 1 ects the town' s theme which is dominant one in his short stories and his novel emerges from his birthplace and its history.

This is the backdrop to perform an individual drama, the one of a Colombian family whose inner problems ref 1 ect the whole society and acquire universal dimension.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{considers the}} topical {{issue of the}} relationship between secured transactions and insolvency laws in the light of two recent international instruments, the 2001 Cape Town Convention on international interests on mobile equipment and the (at the <b>time)</b> <b>Draft</b> UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions. Both instruments, though differing in their scope of application and in their nature, pursue the primary goal of promoting secured credit through efficient and clear rules. Such a goal may be, however, in contrast with national insolvency law policies, especially when rescue of the defaulting debtor's economic activity is attempted. Thus, the international uniform rules should try to find an - admittedly difficult - balance between the need to foster reorganisation procedures and the goal of encouraging pre-commencement financing of enterprises. The contribution considers several aspects which are crucial to the relationship between the pre-commencement creditor rights and insolvency-related policies: avoidance of preferential transactions, priority of liens arising by operation of law, opportunity to limit all-encompassing security devices in favour of (certain) unsecured creditors, tension between creditors’ preferential satisfaction and rescue proceedings, treatment of title retention instruments in insolvency. After a thorough analysis of the uniform law provisions dealing with the above mentioned aspects, the conclusion is reached that both the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide and the Cape Town Convention offer a number of fruitful suggestions towards finding a balanced solution, while the Aircraft Protocol to the Cape Town Convention shows a marked preference for enhancing the secured creditor's position to the detriment of general insolvency policies.
