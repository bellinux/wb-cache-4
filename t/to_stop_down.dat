50|$|The Grafik-Clarons are 6-element, 4-group, {{symmetrical}} plasmat-type lenses with a 64° {{angle of}} coverage, designed for 1:1 flat-field reproduction, {{but can be}} used as macro lenses at magnifications up to 5:1 as well. It is recommended <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> to at least than f/22 for use at infinity. They are available in barrel mount, as well as mounted in shutters.|$|E

25|$|As {{a matter}} of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus {{generally}} have better sharpness when <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> some– note that this is sharpness in the plane of critical focus, setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>down,</b> and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the 4– 8 range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.|$|R
5000|$|Binder {{created the}} {{signature}} gun barrel sequence {{for the opening}} titles of the first Bond film, Dr. No (1962). Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down {{the barrel of a}} [...]38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear.|$|E
50|$|Catadioptric lens - {{catadioptric}} lenses are {{a form of}} {{telephoto lens}} but with a light path that doubles back on itself and with an objective that is a mirror combined with some form aberration correcting lens (a catadioptric system) rather than just a lens. A centrally-placed secondary mirror and usually an additional small lens group bring the light to focus. Such lenses are very lightweight and can easily deliver very long focal lengths but they can only deliver a fixed aperture and have none {{of the benefits of}} being able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the aperture to increase depth of field.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma 30mm 1.4 EX DC HSM lens has unusual optical properties. With most {{photographic}} lenses, vignetting is {{drastically reduced}} by stopping down the aperture by about 1 f-stop. This lens {{has a more}} linear response to stopping down the aperture. To reduce vignetting by about one half, it is required <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the aperture by over 3 full f-stops. The optical resolution properties of this lens are also unique. Most lenses are typically sharp {{in the center of}} the image frame, and softer in the edges. This problem is typically solved by stopping down the lens. This lens has little response to such an effort. When stopped down by over 4 stops, the edges of the frame are still soft. However, the center resolution of the lens is high when used wide open, and becomes exceedingly high when the lens is stopped down.|$|E

5000|$|Walsh had a 22 year {{career in}} politics, {{beginning}} {{with her first}} election in 1988 when she was voted in {{as a member of}} the Massachusetts State House. She served the 10th Suffolk District in the House of Representatives between 1988 and 1992. During her political career, she helped to pass notable legislation including an amendment to increase education funding which directly affected Norfolk County Agricultural High School. She voted for gay civil marriage in March of 2004 and also established jail diversion programs. During her career, she was also attributed with bringing back the Truman Rally, an election eve political rally in West Roxbury. She was also the first state lawmaker to call for Cardinal Bernard Law <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> amid the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston in 2002. She also pushed for reform of the Big Dig transportation project in Boston.|$|E

50|$|At 12:17 p.m., Scott Brayton, {{testing a}} back-up car, did a half-spin {{in the middle}} of turn two, and crashed hard into the outside wall exiting the turn. The car slid 600 feet <b>to</b> a <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the backstretch. Brayton was found {{unconscious}} in the car, and was transported immediately to Methodist Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 12:50 p.m. EST. Brayton was killed instantly of basilar skull fracture.|$|R

50|$|The lens {{was part}} of a group of four {{convertible}} lenses: 400mm f/8, 600mm f/8, 800mm f/8, and the 1200mm. The lenses were in two parts: a focusing and aperture control section which mounted directly to the camera using the Canon FL breech-lock bayonet mounting ring; and the head end, which determined the focal length of the lens. The control section was common to each of the four head-end sections. The 1200mm head end was a preset aperture type, so the lens had <b>to</b> be <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> manually for exposure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you have}} made a nice {{business}} of it, young ladies,' Mr. Singleton said, when he paid them his first visit; 'this is what comes of mountaineering. You would have done much better <b>to</b> have <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> here in the valley, instead of pretty nearly frightening us all to death, besides risking your own lives and injuring your health. I am glad to hear that your sister is a little better this morning, Miss Fortescue; the doctor thinks that the worst has passed, though she will still have a troublesome time of it.' ...|$|R

50|$|Similarly, {{most modern}} {{motorcycles}} use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the pedal operated selector on modern motorcycles, with no neutral position between gears (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is {{not conducive to}} having the long shift time of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> slow <b>down,</b> or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.|$|R

50|$|Normally a train {{can only}} enter a block {{if it is}} free. The block is a track section delimited by signals, whose length depends on the {{distance}} needed for a train <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> or slow <b>down,</b> in the worst conditions on the portion of line under consideration.

5000|$|Fittipaldi's team {{scheduled}} a [...] "timed" [...] splash & go fuel-only stop for lap 194. Jockeying for position, Unser unlapped himself on lap 183. Two laps later, Unser was {{just ahead of}} Fittipaldi as they approached turn 4. Fittipaldi admitted a driver error as he drove over the inside rumble strips causing the rear tires to lose grip. Fittipaldi's car slid loose, and the right rear wheel tagged the outside wall exiting turn 4. After leading 145 laps, Fittipaldi's crashed car slid <b>to</b> a <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the main stretch. The crash handed Unser {{the lead of the}} race, with Jacques Villeneuve on the lead lap in second.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} junction at Upwey Junction was immediately {{south of the}} station; the branch line descended steeply from the junction, while the main line continued to climb. The line was falling at 1 in 44 and unfitted goods trains required <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> pin <b>down</b> brakes. Upwey station was at 0m 35c, and gradients were more moderate from there passing Friar Waddon Milk Platform at 2m 00c and climbing at 1 in 228 and then a short length of 1 in 60 to Coryates Halt, 2m 79c. Continuing then at 1 in 60 rising, the line reached Portesham at 4m 47c. The line then fell with a ruling gradient of 1 in 60 to Abbotsham at 6m 3c.|$|R

This claim has yet to be confirmed. WikiLeaks alluded to the attack on Twitter, tweeting [...] "Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing. We ask supporters <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> taking <b>down</b> the US internet. You proved your point."

50|$|The United FNL {{groups were}} a strong {{movement}} {{in support of}} the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam, and progg bands often played at their demonstrations.

Lincoln had been in seventh place and in a play-off position in the previous January.|$|R
