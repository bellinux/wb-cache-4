5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the {{architecture of}} southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} emigrated. Traditional construction in this part of Borneo, also known as South Kalimantan, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved. The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (andry) supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (tandro-trano). In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> peak. Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.|$|E
5|$|The niches in {{the lowest}} zone of <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> contain nine angels, of which Cockerell {{identifies}} Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the spandrel of the door.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is a commercial version of the Italianate style. The bracketed eaves in <b>the</b> <b>gables</b> are typical of the style. Originally <b>the</b> <b>gables</b> had round-arch windows {{that are associated with}} local German immigrants.|$|R
50|$|The attic {{level of}} <b>the</b> east <b>gable</b> and <b>the</b> central <b>gable</b> on <b>the</b> south {{have a small}} triple window with smooth-faced stone {{segmental}} arch and transom. The roof {{is marked by a}} wide overhanging eave and cornice between <b>the</b> <b>gables</b> and a thin cornice of metal-trimmed stone on them. The two dormers piercing the roof on either side of <b>the</b> central <b>gable</b> have hipped roofs.|$|R

5|$|The west {{elevation}} {{is covered}} with white-painted clapboarding and is undecorated, {{with the exception of}} an off-center concrete block chimney and a single drop pendant similar to the one located at the top of <b>the</b> <b>gable.</b> The concrete block perimeter foundation is visible {{on the south side of}} the church, as is the metal embankment doors that allow access to the church's basement.|$|E
5|$|Two Stars of David {{were added}} {{to the center of the}} facade. One is seen in the old {{photograph}} (above left), over a palmette ornament at the top of the window arch. The other, mounted above the top of <b>the</b> <b>gable,</b> remains visible in the modern photograph (top). The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> in the old photograph, now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The panel with a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older photograph. The decorations to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
50|$|Externally {{the most}} {{noticeable}} architectural {{features of the}} long rectangular building are <b>the</b> numerous <b>gables</b> of <b>the</b> mostly single story structure. <b>The</b> <b>gables,</b> often placed above lancet shaped windows, serve to accentuate the Gothic motifs. This is particularly evident on {{the exterior of the}} altar tribune where three tall narrow windows rise up into <b>the</b> <b>gables</b> themselves, <b>the</b> tribune itself is three sided, the wooden construction making the traditional Romanesque curve in stone impossible.|$|R

50|$|There is one listed {{building}} within the village called <b>the</b> <b>Gables.</b> <b>The</b> {{building is a}} pair of cottages thought to have been built around 1840. One of the outstanding features of the cottages are <b>the</b> ornamental fretted <b>gable</b> end barge boards.|$|R
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at either side of <b>the</b> <b>gable.</b> Thorpe originally intended the main entrance {{of the house to}} be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in <b>the</b> <b>gable.</b> The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E

5|$|The chancel, {{which has}} a ceiling {{decorated}} by C. E. Kempe, has three windows {{in the style of}} the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{mausoleum}} {{was built}} in 1909 by Edward Lyulph, 4th Lord Stanley. He died in 1925 and it contains his ashes and those of his wife, Mary Katherine, who died in 1929. The mausoleum is built in ashlar buff and red sandstone with a Kerridge stone-slate roof. It was designed in the neo-Jacobean style by Paul Phipps, and is rectangular in shape, with two storeys and a three-bay north front. The central bay contains a door, above which is the Stanley crest, a three-light window and a date plaque in <b>the</b> <b>gable.</b> On {{the sides of the}} upper storey are three four-light windows. Inside the mausoleum is a white marble sarcophagus. The yew tree in the churchyard is 1,200 years old.|$|E
5|$|The sculptures on {{the west}} front at Wells include {{standing}} figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures {{and many of the}} architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy <b>the</b> <b>gable.</b> A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.|$|E

5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Charleston, South Carolina, the {{hurricane}} washed aground several ships and uprooted numerous trees, though {{damage to the}} city harbor was minimal. The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, {{the hurricane}} {{was considered to be}} the worst since the 1804 Antigua–Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94acres was ruined nearby. At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. <b>The</b> <b>gable</b> sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations. At Bald Head Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern. Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the Bogue Banks, the remains of the Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, a dead body was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. <b>The</b> <b>gable</b> wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
50|$|Innisfail Court House, {{designed}} in the inter-war classical style, is a two-storeyed brick building with a corrugated-iron roof and rendered details to <b>the</b> <b>gables</b> and verandahs. A curved portico forms {{the entrance to the}} building and addresses the corner through two columns with Ionic capitals. A double-height verandah runs down each street facade. <b>The</b> <b>gables</b> are embellished with broken pediments and Venetian windows.|$|R
50|$|The bargeboards to <b>the</b> {{verandah}} <b>gable</b> {{are shaped}} and rounded at each end, with a star pattern cut {{out from the}} resulting panel of timber. <b>The</b> triangular <b>gable</b> infill is made of decorated timber. A similarly ornate infill panel adorns <b>the</b> other larger <b>gable.</b> It projects approximately 30 cm from the wall below and is supported by carved timber brackets. A double set is located {{either side of the}} triple window below. A finial projects from <b>the</b> <b>gable's</b> ridge.|$|R

5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of <b>the</b> <b>gable</b> beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E
