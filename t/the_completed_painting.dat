25|$|Alma-Tadema left Taeye's {{studio in}} November 1858 {{returning}} to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where {{he began working}} with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio {{was one of the}} most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{completed}} {{by the start of}} 1519, <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> was apparently only exhibited to a wider public in the Vatican in late December 1519 and then again in the following April, before being sent to Narbonne. [...] In the second exhibition, from 12 April 1520, it was shown together with Raphael's Transfiguration. [...] Raphael had died on April 6th, and his Transfiguration came straight from being displayed by his body as it lay in state in his studio. [...] In the event, as described by Vasari, both paintings were praised, but the Raphael much preferred, and only the Sebastiano was sent to Narbonne.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> was gifted to King William III of the Netherlands. Saleh {{said that}} it was a [...] "token of thanks" [...] for the Dutch {{government}} paying for his education in Europe for nearly twenty-three years. After several years in the Palace in The Hague, The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro was hung in Bronbeek, a home for Royal Colonial Military veterans. Around the early 1970s, The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro was given some restoration, including a new coat of varnish. In 1978, the Oranje Nassau Foundation arranged for the work to be sent to the government of Indonesia; this was done {{under the terms of the}} Cultural Accord of 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Hale's friend Clare Boothe Luce, {{an ardent}} admirer of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, almost {{immediately}} commissioned Kahlo {{to paint a}} recuerdo (remembrance) portrait of their deceased mutual friend, so that in Kahlo's words: [...] "her life must not be forgotten". Luce understood a recuerdo to be an idealized memorial portrait and was doubtless expecting a conventional over-the-fireplace portrait for her $400. After being shown in March in Paris, <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> arrived in August 1939: Luce claims she was so shocked by the unwrapped painting that she [...] "almost passed out". What Kahlo created was a graphic, narrative retablo, detailing every step of Hale's suicide. It [...] depicts Hale standing on the balcony, falling to her death while also lying on the bloody pavement below. Luce was so offended that she seriously considered destroying it, but instead, she had the sculptor Isamu Noguchi paint out {{the part of the}} legend that bore Luce's name. Luce simply left the work crated up in the care of Frank Crowninshield, only to be presented with it again decades later, when Crowninshield's heirs discovered it in storage. She donated it anonymously to the Phoenix Art Museum, where it was eventually outed as a Luce donation. The museum retains ownership, although the painting is frequently on tour in exhibitions of Kahlo's works.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> {{is fixed}} with an {{application}} of [...] "waterglass" [...] (sodium silicate) treated with ammonium carbonate, applied in a fine spray in several layers, until no more is absorbed. The chemical interaction of the fixative with the underlying pigments and ground create a material analogous to marble, and highly resistant to chemical corrosion.|$|E

50|$|Fiberglass {{cloth and}} mat {{replaced}} canvas as reinforcement {{and support for}} the colored resin (paint). They were painted with a brush face down on a waxed Formica table mold.

5000|$|The former abbey church, St. Mary's, {{began in}} 1168 as a palace church for the Rügen prince, Jaromar I, and was {{completed}} before 1193, {{apart from the}} westwork. The triple-aisled basilica church is the oldest surviving brick building in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

50|$|The {{painting}} of The Wedding at Cana was commissioned on 6 June 1562 {{to decorate the}} new refectory of the Benedictine Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice; the dining hall had been designed by the architect Andrea Palladio. The business contract, between the Benedictine monks and the painter Paolo Veronese, stipulated {{that he was to}} receive 324 ducats, personal and domestic maintenance, and a barrel of wine in payment for the painting. Assisted by his brother, Benedetto Caliari, Veronese produced the biblical picture in fifteen months, and delivered <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> in September 1563.|$|E
50|$|For his oil {{paintings}} on canvas, Aimé Morot had {{a preference for}} a colour palette consisting of silver white, zinc white, yellow ochre, red ochre, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, raw sienna, burnt sienna, cobalt blue, emerald green, rose madder, carmine lake and ivory black. His painting medium consisted of oil mixed with some turpentine or sometimes with copal. He would start his painting by making a rough outline of the entire subject on a well-dried oiled canvas using a brush or charcoal, then applied the paint. When <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting</b> had dried for a long time, he finally applied light varnish.|$|E

The new church was consecrated in 1745. It was renovated several times: in 1912, <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>painted</b> and carved wooden ceiling and the chancel were changed into concrete.

5000|$|Parrish {{referred}} to Daybreak as his [...] "great painting", {{the epitome of}} his work. Measuring 26.5 x 45 in, the painting employs a formal layout similar to a stage set, with two feminine figures. Painted using preparatory photographs, the models were his regular models, Kitty Owen (granddaughter of William Jennings Bryan), Parrish's daughter Jean, and Susan Lewin. Only two figures appear in <b>the</b> <b>completed</b> <b>painting,</b> though pencil studies indicate that the artist originally intended a third near the righthand column.

40|$|Practiced {{for more}} than three {{thousand}} years, Chinese painting stresses the notion of "implicit meaning" in which painters use a minimum amount of strokes to express their deepest feelings. Chinese landscape and figure paintings are the two major themes of Chinese painting. Of relevant interest is more thoroughly understand Chinese art by analyzing basic rules of Chinese painting. This paper proposes two novel methods capable of synthesizing rock textures in Chinese landscape painting and synthesizing portraits in Chinese figure painting, respectively. In addition to saving time during trial and error, these two methods attempt to synthesize painting styles. After users only specify the contour and parameters, our methods underwrite <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>painting</b> process. With <b>the</b> requirement of familiarity with painting skills, individuals can paint various styles of Chinese painting...|$|R
