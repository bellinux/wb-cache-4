5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of several studies.

5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> preferred location. An alternative interpretation {{of the events of}} 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.|$|E

25|$|Members of Python contributed their {{services}} to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble, {{at other times}} as individuals. The cause <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of Amnesty International. Between 1976 and 1981, the troupe or its members appeared in four major fund-raisers for Amnesty—known collectively as the Secret Policeman's Ball shows—which were turned into multiple films, TV shows, videos, record albums, and books. These benefit shows and their many spin-offs raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty, raised public and media awareness {{of the human rights}} cause, and influenced many other members of the entertainment community (especially rock musicians) to become involved in political and social issues. Among the many musicians who have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own benefit events—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Monty Python are U2, Bob Geldof, Pete Townshend, and Sting. The shows are credited by Amnesty with helping the organisation develop public awareness in the US, where one of the spin-off films was a major success.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} dissented from {{the view of}} Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music.

The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype." [...] Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: [...] "What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> dominant style in rock since, with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackie Chan {{contacted}} Benny Chan {{shortly after}} the release of New Police Story to discuss plans for a new action film. Chan stated {{that he did not want}} to play the typical nice guy role <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> staple of his previous films. Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a petty criminal who has fallen out with his family over his gambling habit. Benny Chan had originally intended for Jackie to play a full-fledged villain, who [...] "hits women and burns people with cigarettes". However, the script was toned down to appease the Chinese censors, who found the character to be too evil. Nevertheless, for only the third time in his acting career, Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison.|$|E
500|$|Ben Rawson-Jones of {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy gave the episode two stars out of five. He characterised the episode as being [...] "as hollow {{as a big}} chocolate Easter egg" [...] because it was [...] "lacking in the enthralling drama and compelling characterisation <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> lynchpin of the Russell T Davies era". His main criticism was towards Ryan's character, describing the romantic tension between Christina and the Doctor as [...] "feeling forced" [...] and arguing that Ryan was [...] "utterly unconvincing" [...] as Christina. Conversely, he was appreciative of Strong's direction and the UNIT subplot. Specifically, he approved of Evans' performance, noting that [...] "the fact that Malcolm names a unit of measurement after himself is both inspired and hilarious". His review ended by describing the episode as [...] "lifeless {{for much of the}} hour" [...] and expressing his hope that the ambiguous entity from Carmen's premonition would [...] "hurry up".|$|E
