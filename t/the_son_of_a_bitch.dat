5000|$|Some researchers—among them Gaeton Fonzi, Larry Hancock, Noel Twyman, and John Simkin—believe that CIA {{operative}} David Morales {{was involved}} in the Kennedy assassination. Morales' friend, Ruben Carbajal, claimed that in 1973 Morales opened up about his involvement with the Bay of Pigs Invasion operation, and stated that [...] "Kennedy had been responsible for him having to watch all the men he recruited and trained get wiped out." [...] Carbajal claimed that Morales said, [...] "Well, we took care of that SOB, didn't we?" [...] Morales is alleged to have once told friends, [...] "I was in Dallas when we got <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch,</b> and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard", presumably referring to the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas and to the later assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles, California on June 5, 1968. Morales is alleged to have expressed deep anger toward the Kennedys for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of Pigs Invasion.|$|E

5000|$|Orson Welles (1915-1985) is {{included}} on the list {{on the basis of}} a comment taken from a collection of Kenneth Tynan interviews: [...] "I think Oxford wrote Shakespeare. If you don't agree, there are some awfully funny coincidences to explain away". In other interviews conducted in the late '60s and early '70s, Welles expressed the orthodox opinion that Shakespeare wrote the plays: [...] "... He was a country boy, the son of a butcher, who'd made it into court. He spent years getting himself a coat of arms. He wrote mostly about kings." [...] In the 1980s he said [...] "The mystery surrounding Shakespeare is greatly exaggerated. We know a lot about his financial dealings, for example. He was brilliant in arranging his finances, you see. He died very rich from real-estate investments. <b>The</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> did everything! And finally he got what his father had always wanted—a coat of arms. His father was a butcher. And a mayor of Stratford." [...] His listing has since been amended to acknowledge that Welles was not an anti-Stratfordian for most of his life.|$|E
50|$|As {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Harrison {{was one of the}} three or four key people behind the creation of the Social Security system in 1935. He also promoted low tariffs and reciprocal trade agreements. When the Senate majority leader’s job opened up in 1937, Harrison was expected to win the position, but nose counts put him in a near tie with Kentucky’s Alben Barkley. Harrison’s campaign manager asked Bilbo, the junior member from Mississippi, to consider voting for his fellow Mississippian. Bilbo, a race-baiting Democratic demagogue whose base was among tenant farmers, hated the upper-class Harrison, who represented the rich planters. The rivalry between the two had deepened over years of disagreement over aspects of the New Deal and how federal money should distributed throughout Mississippi. Bilbo said he would vote for Harrison only if he were personally asked. Harrison replied, “Tell <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> I wouldn’t speak to him even if it meant the presidency of the United States.” Despite Harrison's support for Roosevelt and his policies, shortly before the vote, the president wrote a letter of support for Barkley. When the ballots were in, Pat Harrison lost by one vote, 37-to-38.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "son of a bitch" [...] in {{the line}} [...] "I'm <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> that named you Sue!" [...] was censored in the Johnny Cash version both on single and the At San Quentin album, and the final line was also edited to remove the word [...] "damn". Both the edited and {{unedited}} versions are available on various albums and compilations. The term [...] "son of a bitch" [...] was edited to [...] "son of a gun" [...] or altogether bleeped out in some versions. When performing the song live in later performances (such as in April 1970 at the White House and in 1994 at the Glastonbury Festival, for example), Cash would himself utter a bleep-censor sound {{in lieu of the}} word. The unedited version of the original San Quentin performance is included on later reissues of the At San Quentin album and on Cash's posthumous The Legend of Johnny Cash album. Silverstein, for his part, does not utter any profanity in his original version, with Sue's father instead identifying himself as the [...] "heartless hound" [...] that named him Sue.|$|E
