5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who, despite {{evidence}} to the contrary, deny that the moon landings took place. The Apollo moon landing hoax claims helped propel conspiracy theories into a quasi-political narrative.|$|E
5|$|The cathedrals {{fall into}} three {{distinct}} groups, {{depending on their}} earlier organisational structure. Firstly, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> that, during the Medieval period as now, were governed by a body of secular clergy or chapter, presided over by a dean. These cathedrals are Chichester, Exeter, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, London, Salisbury, Wells, and York, all of which built specifically to serve as cathedral churches.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as {{the expression of a}} certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5000|$|Cohen {{sees the}} Arabs of Mandatory Palestine as split between two positions. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who agreed with al-Husayni {{that all of}} Palestine must remain Arab and the Zionists must <b>be</b> fought, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who argued that the Zionists were too {{powerful}} to be defeated and that, therefore, the path of wisdom lay {{in some sort of}} co-existence.|$|R

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> {{who will}} {{consider}} it their duty, as {{friends of the}} Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

25|$|In Norway, brunost and gomme (food) {{are also}} popular toppings. As with crèpes, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who prefer a salted style with various mixes, such as blue cheese.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> {{who would}} claim both Samson Raphael Hirsch and Hildesheimer as {{indirect}} philosophical founders of Modern Orthodox Judaism; in fact, of the two, Hildesheimer {{is more likely}} classifiable as such.|$|E
50|$|One thing should, perhaps, be {{made clear}} about the phrase. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who thought (correctly) that you couldn't find seven and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who felt (stuffily) that the seven were not arts. Lively was {{for the most part}} unchallenged. The sacred 7 came from the classics, from 'the seven arts' (which was also the name of a {{magazine}} recently defunct) and I never tried to categorise the contents of the book to conform to the figure.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the air of}} {{persecution}} <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> priests that moved to the area in order to sustain the people in their faith.|$|R
50|$|The French {{art scene}} {{immediately}} after the war went roughly in several directions. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who continued in the artistic experiments of the 1930s and 1940s, especially Surrealism and Geometric abstraction, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> associated with Lyrical abstraction, Tachisme, Nuagisme, Art Informel and paysagisme abstrait (modes of expression along similar lines as Abstract Expressionism or action painting from New York). These artists included Wols, Jean Fautrier, Hans Hartung, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Jean Degottex, Pierre Soulages, Jean Messagier and Georges Mathieu.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> {{who believe}} or {{say they believe}} that Adam is our father and our god, {{that he is the}} father of our spirits and our bodies, and that he is the one we worship.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who {{now call}} {{themselves}} Santa Muerte priests or priestesses, such as Jackeline Rodríguez in Monterrey. She maintains a shop in Mercado Juárez in Monterrey, where tarot readers, curanderos, herbal healers and sorcerers {{can also be}} found.|$|E
25|$|In the {{north-east}} of Magnamund's northern continent {{lies the}} realm of Sommerlund. Its people, the Sommlending, are devoted followers of Kai. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> among them, known as Kai Lords or simply 'the Kai', who possess extraordinary innate abilities. Trained from childhood at the Kai Monastery, the Kai Lords are Sommerlund's greatest defense against Naar's agents.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> freshly {{brought to}} Rome from overseas, whose merits or demerits {{had not yet}} been appraised--they wore no tablet round the neck, but their feet were whitened all over with chalk; and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> whose heads <b>were</b> surmounted by an ugly felt hat in token that the State {{treasury}} tendered no guarantee for them. Their period of servitude had been so short that nothing was known about them, about their health, their skill, or their condition.|$|R

25|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the population believes {{that at least some}} UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view is that although they may be unexplained, they do not {{rise to the level of}} convincing evidence.|$|E
25|$|Government policies- the {{different}} {{policies that are}} present in the various countries influences the level of housing inequality. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> policies which favor the rich and disadvantage the poor thus changing infrastructures available in an area. The housing system and the legal documents required to set up structures are a limiting factor to many people in a given country/ area.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{economic}} ramifications of such restrictions, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those,</b> including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits. They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> {{among the}} unregenerated who {{attributed}} the unceasing head-winds to our distressing choir-music. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who said openly {{that it was}} taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going on, {{even when it was}} at its best; and that to exaggerate the crime by letting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence. These said that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship.|$|R

25|$|Gwon Geun {{wrote that}} Li Zemin's map had many gaps and {{omissions}} concerning Korea. It {{is not clear}} how Korea was depicted on Li's map since Korea is out of the range of the extant derivative (southern half of the original). The modified version of Qingjun's map provides a relatively proper shape of Korea though place names presented <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> of the preceding Goryeo Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> in golf {{who would}} argue into next {{month that the}} final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the {{greatest}} head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around {{for the first five}} hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters. What's for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.|$|E
25|$|And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> {{who have}} {{determined}} {{not only the}} year of our Lord's birth, but also the day… And the followers of Basilides hold {{the day of his}} baptism as a festival, spending the night before in readings. And they say that it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the fifteenth day of the month of Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of the same month.|$|E
50|$|Among {{descendants}} of Sephardic Anusim, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> {{who attempted to}} maintain crypto-Judaism. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> people still today in Spain, Portugal and throughout Hispanic America and Brazil who retain familial customs of Jewish origins.|$|R
60|$|I suppose {{things are}} just the same elsewhere,--I mean the {{peculiar}} kind of discontent that crept into the Church of England congregation in Mariposa after the setting up of the Beacon. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who claimed that they had seen the error from the first, though they had kept quiet, as such people always do, from breadth of mind. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who had felt years before how it would end, but their lips were sealed from humility of spirit. What was worse <b>was</b> that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> others who grew dissatisfied with the whole conduct of the church.|$|R
50|$|This case {{showed that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a growing {{class of people}} willing to depart from {{tradition}} and attend a baseball game on a Sunday. It also indicates that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who adamantly resisted such change.|$|R
