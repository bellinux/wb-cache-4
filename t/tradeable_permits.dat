40|$|We {{develop a}} three-stage model of {{abatement}} technology search, adoption, and deployment. Using this model, which draws on search theory tools more frequently used in labour and monetary economics, we compare market-based and command-and-control pollution control instruments {{with respect to}} the incentives each provides for abatement technology search and adoption, expected emissions reductions, and expected compliance costs. We motivate our work by examining firm-level decisions in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, where firms are developing new abatement technologies to reduce fluid tailings associated with mining operations. We show that the polluting firm always has more incentives to search for and adopt a more efficient abatement technology under either an emissions tax or a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> system than under an equivalently stringent emissions standard. We also show that while expected incentives for innovation are comparable under emissions taxes and <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regimes, the likelihood for total future compliance costs to be reduced after an increase in the stringency of environmental policy - the so-called Porter hypothesis - is higher with a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regime...|$|R

The developing countries will, nevertheless, bear the highest burdens under this treaty. The agreement is also analysed under different <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regimes and compared to uniform percentage reductions. The transfers from <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> systems are high, and may be difficult for political leaders to justify.

40|$|Market-based {{economic}} instruments {{have become}} increasingly important as alternatives to conventional methods of environmental regulation, as public policy makers are increasingly aware of the ineffectiveness of command and control regulation. A remarkable breakthrough {{in the search for}} lasting solutions to pressing environmental problems is the emergence of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits.</b> They recognize the need for establishing property rights prior to addressing the issues of environmental degradation, and offer solutions that are cost-effective, without requiring complex technical information about industry structures to monitor compliance. However, the current literature provides little guidance for evaluating the overall effectiveness of this new economic instrument. The lack of simultaneous emphasis on all of the important dimensions of market-based regulation led to conflicting views among economists as to the significance of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> and the circumstances under which they perform effectively. In an attempt to resolve these different viewpoints, this dissertation undertakes an in-depth inquiry into three fundamental facets of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> namely political economy aspects, cost aspects and efficiency aspects. The primary emphasis is on the U. S. SO 2 emissions trading program which was accompanied by the Amendments to the U. S. Clean Air Act in 1990 (CAAA). Using a political economy framework, the dissertation examines the institutional dimensions of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> and explores how they influence the instrument choice at different stages of the policy making process. The investigation uncovers a number of important linkages of political, social, legal and market conditions, whose interactions determine the desirability of market-based economic instruments over other alternatives. Using examples mainly from the United States, it demonstrates how the performance of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> depends on situation-specific characteristics of the above factors. The dissertation then considers the cost aspects of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> in order to elucidate the behaviour of the affected firms, and to resolve conflicting views of the potential effects of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> on the production costs of regulated industries. The investigation is based on an econometric framework and a large-scale data set representing coal-fuelled electric utilities operating in the United States. It reveals that there has been an upward pressure on the production costs of electric utilities {{in the aftermath of the}} CAAA, and that as a result, the utilities have adjusted their optimal mix of inputs by shifting away from pollution-intensive inputs. The empirical analysis of market-based regulation then explores efficiency aspects of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a Tobit model. This reveals that <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> created an incentive to search for "greener" production technologies as part of the compliance with the new market-based regulation. In particular, the resulting improvements to the existing power generation technologies surpass the increases in production costs. Therefore, the CAAA resulted in a net improvement in production efficiency of the U. S. electric utilities. This evidence is consistent with the latest findings of the literature, and supports the Porter hypothesis, that environmental regulation confers to firms a dynamic incentive to innovate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We compare three {{different}} {{views on the}} long run efficiencies of emission taxes which include thresholds (inframarginal exemptions), and of <b>tradeable</b> emission <b>permits</b> where some permits are initially free. The differences are caused by different assumptions about whether thresholds and free permits should be subsidies given only to firms that produce, or full property rights. Treating tax thresholds, as well as free permits, as property rights would depart from the conventional view, but would allow greater flexibility in making economic instruments both efficient and acceptable. Such flexibility could be very important in achieving efficient control of greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{advocate}} a new initial allocation mechanism for a tradable pollution permit market. We outline a Permit Allocation Contest (PAC) that distributes permits to firms {{based on their}} rank relative to other firms. This ranking is achieved by ordering firms based on an observable 'external action' where the external action is an activity or characteristic of the firm that is independent of their choice of emissions in the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market. We show that this mechanism efficiently allocates permits and, as a result, the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market is cost-effective. We determine the symmetric equilibrium strategy of each firm in choosing their external action and find the choice {{is influenced by the}} firm's cost structure and the regulator's choice of permit allocation schedule (distribution of permits to the market). Furthermore, we investigate the factors that determine the regulator's choice of optimal permit allocation schedules. Rank-order contests, pollution permits, initial allocation...|$|R

40|$|Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention, {{came into}} force in 2005, {{emissions}} trading {{has been the}} preferred approach for any international efforts to control, and eventually reduce, greenhouse gas emissions. There are several emission trading schemes already in operation {{and others at the}} planning stage. The purpose of this note is to provide the reader with a brief overview of emissions trading, the types of trading schemes and an examination of existing and proposed schemes. Emissions trading schemes are based around the concept of setting a desired level of emissions and issuing a number of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> or allowances, allowing this level of emissions to be made. The number of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> is fixed, in effect limiting the total quantity of emissions that can be made in any one period. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> are quotas, allowances or ceilings on emissions levels that, once allocated to an emitter, can be traded subject to a set of prescribed rules...|$|E
40|$|Australia's {{ability to}} meet its {{commitment}} to reduce greenhouse gases under the Kyoto convention will probably require at least some government intervention. Traditionally, approaches to reducing pollution in Australia have {{tended to focus on}} the adoption of emission standards. Theoretical criticism by environmental economists has, in part, resulted in a movement toward the adoption of market based mechanisms for pollution abatement; and flirtations with carbon taxes and <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each instrument is subject to significant weaknesses. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> are administratively complex for both polluter and administrator and can lead to production bottlenecks where polluters cannot find requisite permits. A carbon tax is simpler to administer and offers much more flexibility, but can have regressive and inequitable economic impacts. Of these approaches, <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> offer greater potential for achieving set emissions reductions, but tend to be restricted in application to large emitters such as industry. It is argued here that to be truly cost effective, incentives to reduce emissions need to be targeted {{as close as possible to}} the point of fuel consumption-and hence greenhouse emission: by both industry and the household consumer. This paper explores the benefits and limitations of adopting a mixed incentive scheme applied to the energy consumer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed consumer carbon reduction incentive (CBCRI) incorporates elements of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> carbon taxes and emission reduction subsidies. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} a compliance system for a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market as an informal mechanism design problem in an international situation with limited information, and weak enforcement. We specifically consider the embryonic <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market associated with the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). We outline the practical constraints on the compliance system for this market in terms of information flows, incentives and capacities. Then we use a heuristic contracting model to apply results from contract theory, and find the important elements of an effective system. We conclude that clear definition ex ante of compliance, in terms of verifiable outcomes, is critical to effective monitoring and enforcement. The best way to define compliance will depend on a tradeoff between efficiency, risk and transaction costs, and may vary among different types of project. We also conclude that the buyer country, which is a developed country, should be held solely liable for compliance ex post. This is because of its advantageous position as a monitor and enforcer for the global community in a given project...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 {{attempts}} {{to address the}} problem of global warming by establishing national greenhouse gas emissions targets and timetables. To reduce emissions, the protocol outlines a <b>tradeable</b> pollution <b>permit</b> system. The system would allow countries with high abatement costs to purchase permits from countries with low abatement costs, equalizing global marginal abatement costs. The protocol, however, is destined to fail because of the free-rider problem and the problem of trade leakage.
