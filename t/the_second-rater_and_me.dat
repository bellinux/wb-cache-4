The greatest portrait painters have painted both, man and the intention of his soul; Rembrandt and El Greco; it's only <b>the</b> <b>second-raters</b> who've only painted man. A {{lily of the valley}} would be lovely even if it didn't smell, but it's more lovely because it has perfume. That picture"--he pointed to Lawson's portrait--"well, the drawing's all right and so's the modelling all right, but just conventional; it ought to be drawn and modelled so that you know the girl's a lousy slut. Correctness is all very well: El Greco made his people eight feet high because he wanted to express something he couldn't get any other way." ...|$|R

Fifty linguistic cultural items from the Malay translation of Shui Hu Zhuan have been used as the corpus of this analyses.

A simple quantitative and qualitatif analysis on the feedbacks shows that {{the differences in}} the perception of the concept of translatability between the one that is held by the reseachers <b>and</b> that of <b>the</b> <b>second-raters</b> prove to be the main source of varieties of translation outputs.

40|$|Two novel type I ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) {{were found}} in the storage roots of Mirabilis expansa, an underutilized Andean root crop. The two RIPs, named <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2, were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange perfusion chromatography, and C 4 reverse-phase chromatography. The two proteins were found to be similar in size (27 and 27. 5 kD) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their isoelectric points were determined to be greater than pH 10. 0. Amino acid N-terminal sequencing revealed that both <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 had conserved residues characteristic of RIPs. Amino acid composition and western-blot analysis further suggested a structural similarity between <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2. ME 2 showed high similarity to the Mirabilis jalapa antiviral protein, a type I RIP. Depurination of yeast 26 S rRNA by <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 demonstrated their ribosome-inactivating activity. Because these two proteins were isolated from roots, their antimicrobial activity was tested against root-rot microorganisms, among others. <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 were active against several fungi, including Pythium irregulare, Fusarium oxysporum solani, Alternaria solani, Trichoderma reesei, and Trichoderma harzianum, and an additive antifungal effect of <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 was observed. Antibacterial activity of both <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 was observed against Pseudomonas syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and others...|$|R
