5|$|The {{archbishop}} {{swore to}} Henry I {{that he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135.

The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose <b>the</b> <b>oath,</b> and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> in any event.

5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> he made to protect his men would be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oaths</b> of Allegiance and Supremacy Act 1688 (1 Will. & Mar., c. 8) was an Act of the Parliament of England {{passed in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Glorious Revolution. The Act required all office-holders, Members of Parliament and clergy to take <b>the</b> <b>oaths</b> of allegiance and supremacy for the new monarchs, William III and Mary II. The Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, five bishops and approximately four hundred lower clergy refused to take <b>the</b> <b>oaths</b> because they believed their oaths to James II were still valid. The Act thus triggered the nonjuring schism in the Church of England. The non-jurors were deprived of their offices.|$|R
