5|$|The {{ultimate}} decision, {{reached by}} a majority of four judges to three, was that <b>the</b> <b>Migration</b> Act did permit indefinite detention.

Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby dissented, finding instead that <b>the</b> <b>Migration</b> Act should not be interpreted to permit indefinite detention.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Richter {{suggested}} that the majority's legalistic approach, while yielding a workable construction of the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Migration</b> Act, resulted in a dangerous situation {{in this case because}} the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation to be filled.|$|E

However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and <b>the</b> <b>migration</b> of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171â€“168 BC).|$|E

5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in <b>the</b> <b>Migration</b> Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive.
