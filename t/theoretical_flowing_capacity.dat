40|$|The <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> of a {{transportation}} network {{can be reduced}} significantly if its constituent bridges are damaged by natural or man-made hazards. For rapid risk-informed decision making on hazard mitigation and response, it is therefore essential to have a capability to predict the post-hazard <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> of the network efficiently and accurately. However, this is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in hazards and structural damage, and the complex nature of the network flow analysis. Moreover, the bridge structures may experience significant deterioration over their life cycle, which requires time-varying network reliability analysis. This paper proposes a new non-sampling-based approach to estimate the time-varying post-hazard <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> of a bridge transportation network considering structural deterioration of bridges. The proposed approach evaluates the probabilities of structural damage scenarios efficiently using the matrix-based system reliability method and rapidly computes the corresponding <b>flow</b> <b>capacities</b> using a maximum <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> analysis algorithm. The matrix-based framework facilitates the integration of these results to obtain the probabilistic distributions and statistical moments of the network <b>flow</b> <b>capacity.</b> It also enables computing various measures useful for risk-informed decision making, such as the conditional {{mean and standard deviation}} of <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> given observed structural damage, and component importance measures. In the proposed approach, probability calculation and network flow analysis are performed separately, which renders time-varying post-hazard <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> analysis efficient. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example based on the Sioux Falls network under multiple bridge-deterioration scenarios simulating the progress of deterioration. close 111...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel concept of flow {{to measure the}} {{efficiency}} of urban street networks (a kind of complex networks) for travel or shipping goods. More specifically, we define two quantities: flow dimension and <b>flow</b> <b>capacity,</b> to characterize structure of urban street networks. To our surprise for the topologies of urban street networks, previously confirmed {{as a form of}} small world and scale-free networks, we find that (1) the range of their flow dimension is rather wider than their random and regular counterparts, (2) their flow dimension shows a power-law distribution, and (3) they has a higher <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> than their random and regular counterparts. The findings confirm that (1) the wider range of flow dimension and the higher <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> both can be a signature of small world networks, and (2) the <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> can be an alternative quantity for measuring the efficiency of networks or that of the individual nodes.

40|$|It {{is an open}} {{question}} whether a street network of a city has a certain <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> characterizing the <b>flow</b> that can pass through the street network. It s our hypothesis that at least the simple street network has a certain <b>flow</b> <b>capacity.</b> With the purpose of exploring this we studied numerically and experimentally the <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> in some idealized long-street models continuously lined with buildings and exposed to a parallel approaching wind. The height of all the models is the same (H = 69 mm). Three groups of models were studied: models with the same uniform street width (W = H) but different lengths (L = 21. 7 H, 43. 5 H, 72. 5 H); models with the same length (L = 43. 5 H) but different uniform width (W = H, 2 H, 4 H); and models with a change of width at half distance, L/ 2. In the last of the three cases, the width of the upstream half was always the same (W 1 = H), but there was a wider (W 2 = 1. 25 H, 1. 5 H, 2 H) or narrower (W 2 = 0. 75 H, 0. 5 H) downstream half. We normalized flow rates by a reference flow rate equal to the flow rate through an opening far upstream with the same area as the windward entry. The normalized flow rate through the windward entry was about 1. 0 in all cases. For a sufficiently long-street models, a flow balance is established, creating a fully developed region with a constant horizontal <b>flow</b> (<b>flow</b> <b>capacity)</b> and zero vertical mean velocity. The street length does not affect the <b>flow</b> <b>capacity</b> but as expected the width of the street affects the <b>flow</b> <b>capacity.</b> © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The main criteria used to evaluate {{the performance}} are: Fairness, Backward compatibility, Efficiency, Responsiveness, Scalability, TCP friendliness, and convergence. Most of researches were conducted to evaluate fairness. The majority of these researches used only two flows in a Dumbbell topology. Only few papers used several flows. In all cases, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, all flows have the same capacity which may not give an accurate idea about Fairness of different protocols and impact performance results. We propose an evaluation method of Fairness for different high-speed protocols: H-TCP, HS-TCP, Scalable TCP, BIC-TCP and CUBIC protocols using multiple flows with the same <b>flow</b> <b>capacity,</b> and with different <b>flow</b> <b>capacities.</b> Index Terms—High-Speed TCP Protocols, Fairness, <b>flow</b> <b>capacity,</b> Performance...|$|R
