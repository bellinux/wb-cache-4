50|$|In 1981 RAF Trimingham {{was closed}} and the site had been sold and the guardhouse {{converted}} into a private house, but by {{the latter part of}} the 1980s the now Ministry of Defence decided to re-purchase the site. The RAF installed a Marconi Type 91 Martello radar acting as a Ready Platform (along with RAF Hopton and RAF Weybourne) for the UKADGE Series II (United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment) Radar System controlled from the R3 underground control centre at RAF Neatishead. The guardhouse was converted into staff accommodation and offices and basic mess facilities. In May 1996 the Marconi Type 91 'Martello' radar at Trimingham was sold to the Turkish Ministry of Defence and it was replaced by what used to be known as No 86 Signals Unit, with a Type 93 (Plessey type ADGE-305, NATO designation TGRI 50011) that had been moved from Hopton when that base was closed. The Type 93 was originally a mobile installation (however it never actually obtained UK Dept of <b>Transport</b> <b>authorisation</b> to be allowed on UK roads under its own power and anytime it had to be moved, civilian low-loader transport specialists had to be contracted in), but at Trimingham it was fixed to a permanent mounting, due to constant cracking issues with the frame and mobile trailer. The Kevlon dome composed of irregular polygons erected around it and became known locally as the Trimingham golf ball.|$|E

40|$|Current Internet {{communications}} security is typically {{provided by the}} integration of secure transport functionality into client and server software. Two problems arise with this approach: Firstly, the use of integrated security services requires modification to the existing Internet applications, requiring re-development and re-deployment projects. Secondly, high-level security services such as authorisation are not provided by secure transport protocols, requiring applications to rely on customised (and often insecure) mechanisms {{for the provision of}} such services. We propose a platform-independent system that uses proxy applications to provide both secure <b>transport</b> and <b>authorisation</b> services transparently to existing Internet applications. We demonstrate that our approach requires no modification to existing applications, and that our security services are based on existing and widely used technologies. We discuss the merits of our architecture {{in the context of the}} intended deployment environment: an Internet-based heterogeneous private network such as an extranet or Virtual Private Network (VPN). We show that our approach achieves its goals at the expense of introducing a minor degree of performance loss into overall clientâ€“server communications, yet we maintain that this performance loss is a minor expense in relation to the advantages of the system as a whole...|$|R
