Names were given by the unhappy spirit which proved to be correct, and a cupboard was described, which was duly found, though it had never before been suspected. On getting into touch with the spirit I endeavoured to reason with it and to explain how selfish it was to cause misery to others in order to satisfy any feelings of revenge which it might have carried over from earth life. We then prayed for its welfare, exhorted it to rise higher, and received a very solemn assurance, <b>tilted</b> <b>out</b> at the table, that it would mend its ways. I have very gratifying reports that it has done so, and that all is now quiet in the old house.|$|E

40|$|The {{octahedron}} tilt transitions of ABX_ 3 perovskite-structure materials {{lead to an}} anti-polar (or antiferroelectric) {{arrangement of}} dipoles, with the low temperature structure having six sublattices polarized along various crystallographic directions. It is shown that an important mechanism driving the transition is long range dipole-dipole forces acting on both displacive and induced parts of the anion dipole. This acts in concert with short range repulsion, allowing a gain of electrostatic (Madelung) energy, both dipole-dipole and charge-charge, because the unit cell shrinks when the hard ionic spheres of the rigid octahedron <b>tilt</b> <b>out</b> of linear alignment.

40|$|Data {{obtained}} by Pioneer 10 on {{the properties of}} energetic electrons in the Jovian magnetosphere are analyzed. The basic detectors (seven miniature Geiger-Mueller tubes) are described together with the signal processor and sampling techniques. The model of Jupiter used in the data analysis is a centered dipole with a tilt of 9. 5 deg toward 230 deg System III longitude. The energetic-electron observations within the inner magnetosphere are found to indicate that radial as well as pitch-angle diffusion of energetic electrons must take place very rapidly. Outbound observations within the magnetodisk (the region beyond 20 Jupiter radii) are found to indicate a spiraling of the apparent location of the longitude of the dipole tilt, while inbound data indicate a constant value for the apparent longitude of the dipole <b>tilt</b> <b>out</b> to 70 Jupiter radii...|$|R

The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory. The library's architecture is equally striking. The main reading room stands beneath a 32-meter-high glass-panelled roof, <b>tilted</b> <b>out</b> toward the sea like a sundial, and measuring some 160 m in diameter.

50|$|Deployment of the LRV {{from the}} LM's Quadrant 1 bay by the astronauts was {{achieved}} {{with a system}} of pulleys and braked reels using ropes and cloth tapes. The rover was folded and stored in the bay with {{the underside of the}} chassis facing out. One astronaut would climb the egress ladder on the LM and release the rover, which would then be slowly <b>tilted</b> <b>out</b> by the second astronaut on the ground through the use of reels and tapes. As the rover was let down from the bay, most of the deployment was automatic. The rear wheels folded out and locked in place. When they touched the ground, the front of the rover could be unfolded, the wheels deployed, and the entire frame let down to the surface by pulleys.|$|E
5000|$|Most, but not all, large format {{cameras are}} view cameras, with fronts and backs called [...] "standards" [...] {{that allow the}} {{photographer}} to better control rendering of perspective and increase apparent depth of field. Architectural and close-up photographers in particular benefit greatly from this ability. These allow {{the front and back}} of the camera to be shifted up/down and left/right (useful for architectural images where the scene is higher than the camera, and product images where the scene is lower than the camera), and <b>tilted</b> <b>out</b> of parallel with each other left/right, up/down, or both; based on the Scheimpflug principle. The shift and tilt movements make it possible to solve otherwise impossible depth-of-field problems, and to change perspective rendering, and create special effects that would be impossible with a conventional fixed-plane fixed-lens camera.|$|E
5000|$|The axes of {{rotation}} associated with Listing's law are only in Listing's plane for movements that head toward {{or away from}} primary position. For all other eye movements towards or away from some non-primary position, the eye must rotate about an axis {{of rotation}} that <b>tilts</b> <b>out</b> of Listing's plane. Such axes lie in a specific plane associated with this non-primary position. This plane's normal lies halfway between the primary gaze direction and the gaze direction of this non-primary position. This is called 'the half angle rule'. (This complication {{is one of the}} most difficult aspects of Listing's law to understand, but it follows directly from the non-commutative laws of physical rotation, which specify that one rotation followed by a second rotation does not yield the same result as these same rotations performed in the inverse order.) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the adsorption of bis(phthalocyaninato) lutetium(III) (LuPc 2) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite(0001) (HOPG). The growth and self-assembly of the molec-ular layers {{as well as the}} electronic structure has been investigated systematically using scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy combined with density functional the-ory (DFT) calculations and molecular mechanics simulations. We reveal that the adsorption of LuPc 2 leads to the formation of a square-like close-packed structure on the almost inert surface of HOPG, which is corroborated by simulations. Moreover, we observed a parallel orientation of the LuPc 2 molecules in the first monolayer, whereas in subsequent layers an increasing <b>tilt</b> <b>out</b> of the surface plane was found. Tip−sample distance-dependent tunnelling spectroscopy measurements allowed us to detect a shift in the energy positions of the peaks assigned to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital toward the Fermi energy with decreasing tip−sample separation. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{surfboards}} {{intended for}} larger waves are longer (to increase hull speed for paddling, wave-catching, and surfing), and as most shapers orient the rail fins toward {{the nose of}} the board, a longer board inherently results in reduced toe-in of rail fins, therefore less negative angle of attack, less oscillation, greater stability, and higher speeds. Rail fins also typically have some degree of [...] "cant," [...] that is, are <b>tilted</b> <b>out</b> toward the rail they are adjacent to. This is a significant additional factor in lift at various attitudes, drag, and performance, as are the variables of other foils - including flexibility, thickness, and planform. Rail fins evolved into being and surged into popularity as riders (Simon Anderson, most famously) sought a solution to two major performance issues of a central [...] "single" [...] fin - both related to engagement of the foil: For one, a centrally-mounted fin is tilted up out of the water as the board is leaned over, and thus it loses more and more of its lift as the lean angle increases - if the lean angle is acute enough, the fin's tip can be the only area left in the water; the tip may then rapidly stall and, having lost its lift, become disengaged from the water, leaving the board's bottom as the only control surface still operating. Before rail fins became (extremely) popular, this tendency of [...] "single fins" [...] led to riders [...] "nursing" [...] turns - this tendency was a significant limiting factor on performance. The enhanced hold offered by rail fins during turning led to more types of maneuvers being possible. The other major issue leading to rail fins' use is the fact that a rider can use the lift near the rail to increase speed and performance on smaller waves due to the above effects and abilities of these foils.|$|E

40|$|Precessing {{accretion}} discs {{have long}} been suggested as explanations for the long periods observed {{in a variety of}} X-ray binaries, most notably Her X- 1 /HZ Her. We show that an instability of the disc's response to the radiation reaction force from the illumination by the central source can cause the disc to <b>tilt</b> <b>out</b> of the orbital plane and precess in something like the required manner. The rate of precession and disc tilt obtained for realistic values of system parameters compare favourably with the known body of data on X-ray binaries with long periods. We explore other possible types of behaviour than steadily precessing discs that might be observable in systems with somewhat different parameters. At high luminosities, the inner disc tilts through more than 90 degrees, i. e. it rotates counter to the usual direction, which may explain the torque reversals in systems such as 4 U 1626 - 67.
