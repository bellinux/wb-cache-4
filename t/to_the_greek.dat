5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th {{century the}} ideals of the Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became widely known <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E

In 1906 there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined.

5|$|In respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> {{language}} question, {{it becomes}} obvious {{that from the}} very beginning Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E

5|$|On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, {{initiating}} the Greco-Italian War {{as part of}} the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's expansionist ambitions. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to Albania. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British Raid on Taranto, which significantly reduced the threat the Italian Regia Marina posed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> fleet. From the start of the conflict, Kilkis was used as a floating battery based in Salamis. Spare guns from Kilkis and Lemnos were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia.

5|$|After basic {{education}} in Greek with a tutor known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in Romanian Cyrillic (reportedly {{by studying the}} Alexander Romance {{with the help of}} his father's Oltenian servants).
