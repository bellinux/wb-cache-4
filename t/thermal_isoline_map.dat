40|$|Gould and White (1968) {{introduced}} the measurement and <b>isoline</b> <b>mapping</b> of regional preferences, producing preference or “isoeutope” maps. As cartographers know, {{the decision to}} employ <b>isoline</b> <b>mapping</b> as a cartographic display technique is valid insofar as certain assump-tions are met, notably {{the assumption that the}} variable being mapped reflects an underlying continuum. This assumption is doubtful {{in the case of a}} variable such as regional preference insofar as it is based on rankings or ratings of existing regional units such as states for which human cognition is not continuous. The implications of <b>mapping</b> preference with <b>isolines</b> are discussed, particularly with respect to the attitudes they reflect and the cognitive responses they elicit in viewers. We argue that <b>isoline</b> <b>mapping</b> of data such as state preferences pro-duces misleading impressions of intraregional variation and is neither necessary nor desirable. Alternative methods for the collection and cartographic display of regional preference data are discussed. Notably, we propose the use of “psuedo-Chernoff ” faces as an appropriate technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Queries over {{streaming}} data offer {{the potential to}} provide timely information for modern database applications, such as sensor networks and web services. Isoline-based visualization of {{streaming data}} {{has the potential to}} be of great use in such applications. Dynamic (real-time) isoline extraction from the streaming data is needed in order to fully harvest that potential, allowing the users to see in real time the patterns and trends – both spatial and temporal – inherent in such data. This is the goal of this paper. Our approach to isoline extraction is based on data terrains, triangulated irregular networks (TINs) where the coordinates of the vertices corresponds to locations of data sources, and the height corresponds to their readings. We dynamically maintain such a data terrain for the streaming data. Furthermore, we dynamically maintain an <b>isoline</b> (contour) <b>map</b> over this dynamic data network. The user has the option of continuously viewing either the current shaded triangulation of the data terrain, or the current <b>isoline</b> <b>map,</b> or an overlay of both. For large networks, we assume that complete recomputation of either the data terrain or the <b>isoline</b> <b>map</b> at every epoch is impractical. If n is the number of data sources in the network, time complexity per epoch should be O(log n) to achieve real-time performance. To achieve this time complexity, our algorithms are based on efficient dynamic data structures that are continuously updated rather than recomputed. Specifically, we use a doubly-balanced interval tree, a new data structure where both the tree and the edge sets of each node are balanced. As far as we know, no one has applied TINs for data terrain visualization before this work. Our dynamic isoline computation algorithm is also new. Experimental results confirm both the efficiency and the scalability of our approach. ...|$|R

Finally, for the investigated Italian geographical regions (Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, and Campania), the regionalization procedure is developed, and the rainfall-duration-frequency factor appearing in the rainfall-depth-duration equa-tion is calibrated.

These self-adaptive grids add new receivers to the sampling grid in those locations where they are expected to be more useful, so that the performance at the output of the interpolator is enhanced. Self-adaptive sampling grids can be used for minimizing the overall error of the map (improving its quality), or for reducing calculation times, and can be also applied selectively to target areas or contour lines.

Uni- and multivariate data analysis was applied to the data concerning 13 mainly chemical and some biological parameters for the time period 2000 – 2009 from 33 sampling sites. The sampling sites were first clustered then grouped. Besides reed belt and open water areas, smaller localities, which are influenced by water inputs (the treatment plant, the river Wulka, the channels of weekend houses) were also distinguished.

40|$|Previously {{published}} <b>isoline</b> <b>maps</b> of Fennoscandian timberlines {{show that}} their highest elevations {{lie in the}} high mountain areas in central south Norway and from there the limits decrease in all directions. These maps are assumed to show differences in “climatic forest limits”, but the isoline patterns indicate that factors other than climate may be decisive {{in most of the}} area. Possibly the effects of ‘massenerhebung’ and the “summit syndrome” may locally have major effects on the timberline elevation. The main aim of the present study is to quantify the effect of latitude and mountain height on the regional variation of mountain birch timberline elevation. The study is a statistical analysis of previous published data on the timberline elevation and nearby mountain height. Selection of the study sites has been stratified to the Scandinavian mountain range (the Scandes) from 58 to 71 o N where the timberlines reach their highest elevations. The data indicates that only the high mountain massifs in S Norway and N Sweden are sufficiently high to allow birch forests to reach their potential elevations. Stepwise regression shows that latitude explains 70. 9 % while both latitude and mountain explain together 89. 0 % of the timberline variation. Where the mountains are low (approximately 1000 m higher than the measured local timberlines) effects of the summit syndrome will lower the timberline elevation substantially and climatically determined timberlines will probably not have been reached. This indicates that models of future timberlines and thereby the alpine area extent in a warmer world may result in unrealistic conclusions without taking account of local mountain heights...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the spatial variaility of soil moisture content and total porosity as influenced by land use, in Faculty of Agriculture, teaching and Research farm, Shabu, Lafia. A total of 81 observations and samples were collected at every 10 m along the X-axis and 10 m apart along the Y-axis and soil moisture content of the samples was determined gravimetrically, while total porosity was calculated using bulk density from gravimetric measurement. Spatial analyses of the physical properties were done in a GIS environment. Geo-statistical procedure (Mvariogram) of Genstat Package {{was used to determine}} and select appropriate spatial models for all the data set. Win- Surfer Version 7. 0 (Golden Software Inc, Golden, Colorado) was used for interpolation technique called “Ordinary Kriging “ to produce the spatial distribution of soil moisture content and total porosity. The results showed that soil moisture content was negatively skewed but positive kurtosis, while kurtosis and skewness values in soil total porosity were both positive. This implies that both, tested parameters were highly variable and were not normally distributed. Anisotropy was not evident in the directional semivariograms for any of the properties. Therefore, isotropic models were fitted. Relative Nugget Effect (RNE) (The nugget-to-sill ratio (Co/Co + C)) of total porosity was 50 % and 2. 3 % for moisture content. Contour <b>Isoline</b> <b>mapping</b> showed that the surface soil physical properties varied between the experimental plots as determined by land use type and management practices, plots with soil amendments having higher but highly varied surface soil moisture and better porosity. The results of this study demonstrated the need for Site-specific management as required in Precision Agriculture...|$|R
