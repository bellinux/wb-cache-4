5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the <b>talus</b> <b>bone</b> and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the <b>talus</b> <b>bone</b> was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E

40|$|Certain markers in bone {{structure}} allow researchers {{to estimate the}} length of an entire bone based only on a fragmented piece. Forensic anthropologists and bio-archeologists have recently devoted greater attention to the estimation of bone length from fragmented bones. This study aims to evaluate osteometric data in order to distinguish the population affinity of Byzantine individuals, {{as well as to}} estimate the length of the calcaneus and <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> based on incomplete specimens. This is vital because of the importance of talar bones in the assessments of the population-specific features and because calcaneus and <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> tend to preserve better archaeologically. The study includes 160 adult, male, complete and non-damaged calcanei (72 left and 88 right) and 84 adult, male, complete and non-damaged <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> (38 left and 46 right) from the dry, late Byzantine era (13 th Century AD) contexts. A total of 10 bony markers were selected for measurements of calcanei and 14 were selected for tali. Data were subjected to statistical analysis in order to assess bilateral differences in the bony markers. Correlation coefficients were also determined between maximum lengths of calcanei and tali against other markers. Dorsal articular facet length and dorsal articular facet breadth parameters of calcanei showed significant side differences (p< 0. 01).

A total of 99 subjects underwent computed tomography scanning, and {{the left and right}} <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> were both virtually modeled in 3 dimensions. The 4 morphologic parameters were measured 3 times each to obtain the intraclass correlation, and analysis of variance was used to check for any significant differences between the repeated measurements. The average intraclass correlation coefficient for the measurements for 2 to 3 trials was 0. 94 ± 0. 04. Statistical analyses were performed on the data from all 198 <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> using SAS software, comparing male and female and left and right bones. All 4 morphometric values were greater in the male group. No {{significant differences were found between}} the left and right <b>talus</b> <b>bones.</b> A strong positive correlation was observed between the trochlea tali length and the anterior width. The angle of trapezium shape showed no correlation with the other 3 parameters.

Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (<b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|R

Likewise, the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis have been reinterpreted as being the upper fourth premoloar (P4) of Azibius and has been considered a synonym. However, in 2010, Godinot cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar.

40|$|Background: Congenital {{vascular}} malformations are tumour-like, non-neoplastic lesions {{caused by}} disorders of vascular tissue morphogenesis. They are characterised by a normal cell replacement cycle throughout all growth phases {{and do not}} undergo spontaneous involution. Here we present a scintigraphic image of familial congenital vascular malformations in two sisters. Material/Methods: A 17 -years-old {{young woman with a}} history of multiple hospitalisations for foci of vascular anomalies appearing progressively in the upper and lower right limbs, chest wall and spleen. A Parkes Weber syndrome was diagnosed based on the clinical picture. Due to the occurrence of new foci of malformations, a whole-body scintigraphic examination was performed. A 12 -years-old girl reported a lump in the right lower limb present for approximately 2 years, which was clinically identified as a vascular lesion in the area of calcaneus and talus. Phleboscintigraphy visualized normal radiomarker outflow from the feet via the deep venous system, also observed in the superficial venous system once the tourniquets were released. In static and whole-body examinations vascular malformations were visualised {{in the area of the}} medial cuneiform, navicular and <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> of the left foot, as well as in the projection of right calcaneus and above the right talocrural joint. Conclusions: People with undiagnosed disorders related to the presence of vascular malformations should undergo periodic follow-up to identify lesions that may be the cause of potentially serious complications and to assess the results of treatment.

Less fragmentary remains discovered between 2003 and 2009 demonstrated a close relationship between Azibius and Algeripithecus. Descriptions of the <b>talus</b> (ankle <b>bone)</b> in 2011 have helped to strengthen support for the strepsirrhine status of Azibius and Algeripithecus, which would indicate that the evolutionary history of lemurs and their kin is rooted in Africa.

50|$|First {{described}} in the journal Nature by Marc Godinot and Mohamed Mahboubi in 1992, Algeripithecus was once widely {{considered one of the}} oldest known fossil simian primates, giving weight to the African origins hypothesis for simians. It was originally interpreted as a propliopithecid, but was also seen as a proteopithecid by Godinot in 1994 and as a parapithecoid by Seiffert et al. starting in 2005. Based on the discovery of additional fossil teeth and a maxilla (upper jaw) between 2003 and 2009, Tabuce et al. reconstructed Algeripithecus as an azibiid, a group thought to be a type of stem lemuriform, or strepsirrhine primate. According to Tabuce et al., the mandible of Algeripithecus indicates it had an inclined canine tooth, similar to that found in toothcombed primates. Although the anterior dentition of azibiids is unknown, they may have possessed a toothcomb, indicating an ancient stem lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa, possibly descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms). As a result, the African origins of crown strepsirhines (including lemurs and lorisoids) is well supported, whereas the African origins of simians has been placed in doubt, possibly giving favor to an Asian origins hypothesis. However, in 2010, Godinot reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that azibiids may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms. In 2011, Marivaux et al. published an interpretation of recently discovered <b>talus</b> <b>bones</b> of closely related Azibius found at Gour Lazib, which they claimed were more similar to those of living strepsirrhines and extinct adapiforms, not simians, thus reinforcing the strepsirrhine status favored by Tabuce et al. two years earlier.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{paleoanthropologist}} Marc Godinot {{favored a}} relationship between Azibius and simians, but tentatively suggested Azibius may be {{more closely related to}} toothcombed primates, which include all extant strepsirrhines. This latter view has gained increasing support with the reclassification of Algeripithecus (once considered a basal simian) as a closely related azibiid. Additional fossil teeth and the maxilla (upper jaw) of both genera discovered between 2003 and 2009 helped demonstrate their relationship. Based on the same fossil finds, Tabelia—which was also considered {{to be one of the}} oldest known simians along with Algeripithecus—is also now considered to be a synonym of Azibius. Also, the third and fourth lower premolars (P3 and P4) distinguish azibiids from carpolestids, while the upper fourth premoloar (P4) matches what was thought to be the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis, another suspected plesiadapiform or genus of azibiid. Specimens of Dralestes are now recognized as being either Azibius and Algeripithecus, and Tabuce et al. claimed that Dralestes was a synonym of Azibius in 2009. However, in 2010, Godinot cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar. He also reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that they may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms.
