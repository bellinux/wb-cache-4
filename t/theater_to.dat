5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s.

5|$|At this time, Yiddish {{theater in}} London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of {{professional}} Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London {{to a new}} level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage.

Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedlerâa playwright, orchestra leader, and stage managerâthe Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious <b>theater</b> <b>to</b> audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848.
