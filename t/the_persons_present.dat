6000|$|But, as {{the event}} proved, the poor lady's {{withdrawal}} {{was the most}} fortunate circumstance that could have occurred, in her own interests. After condemning the husband's conduct with unsparing severity, the Lord President surprised most of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> by speaking of the wife in these terms: ...|$|E

60|$|Not a {{word was}} spoken {{by any of}} <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present,</b> as the two {{returned}} to their places. The noise of a carriage passing in the street was painfully audible. The chance banging of a door in the lower regions of the house made every one start.|$|E
60|$|WHILE the {{consultation}} at Doctor Lagarde's was still fresh {{in the memory}} of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> at it, Chance or Destiny, occupied in sowing the seeds for the harvest of the future, discovered as one of its fit instruments a retired military officer named Major Mulvany.|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of {{precaution}} he drew up an exact account of {{the proceedings of the}} two nights on the lagoons, giving an account of the meeting, and the names of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present,</b> and placed it in a drawer in his room. He told Giuseppi what he had done.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had barely}} {{pronounced}} the last words, when a startling interruption led to consequences which <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> had not foreseen. A shrill, wailing voice suddenly pierced through the flimsy partition which divided {{the front room}} and the back room. [...] "Bread!" [...] cried the voice in French; [...] "I'm hungry. Bread! bread!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} that when the night porter {{was asked if he}} could, among <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> in court, recognize the Hon.

6000|$|Please {{note that}} roar {{at the end}} of the English {{personal}} anecdote. It is the sign that indicates that the story is over. When you are assured by the narrators that all <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> [...] "roared" [...] or [...] "simply roared," [...] then you can be quite sure that the humorous incident is closed and that laughter is in place.|$|E
60|$|The infant's {{clothing}} proved, on examination, {{to be of}} {{the finest}} linen. He was warmly wrapped in a beautiful shawl of some foreign manufacture, entirely unknown to all <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present,</b> including the master and mistress of the house. Among the folds of the shawl there was discovered an open letter, without date, signature, or address, which it was presumed the woman must have forgotten.|$|E
60|$|While <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> {{were all}} {{gathered}} round {{the doctor and}} the overseer, Madame Fontaine softly {{pushed open the door}} from the courtyard. After a look at the recesses--situated, five {{on either side of the}} length of the room, and closed by black curtains--she parted the curtains of the nearest recess to her, on her left hand; and stepped in without being noticed by anyone.|$|E
50|$|In verbs, <b>the</b> 1st <b>person</b> <b>present</b> {{indicative}} ending is -e (∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugation), or -o.E.g., parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western). In verbs, <b>the</b> 1st <b>person</b> <b>present</b> indicative ending is -o, -i or ∅ in all conjugations. E.g., parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), parli (Northern), ('I speak').|$|R
50|$|This {{results in}} <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>presenting</b> a female {{phenotype}} (i.e., is born with female-like genitalia) {{even though that}} person possesses an XY karyotype. The lack of the second X results in infertility. In other words, viewed from the opposite direction, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> goes through defeminization but fails to complete masculinization.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{a curious}} circumstance," [...] remarked the surgeon, halting Wilson a moment to paste some more court-plaster on his chin, which had gone to leaking blood again, [...] "that in this duel neither of the parties who handled the pistols lost blood while nearly all <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> in the mere {{capacity}} of guests got hit. I have not {{heard of such a}} thing before. Don't you think it unusual?" ...|$|E
60|$|To {{turn to a}} more {{pleasant}} subject. Reflecting on all that had passed at my memorable interview with Romayne, I felt some surprise that one of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> had {{made no effort to}} prevent the burning of the will. It was not to be expected of Stella--or of the doctors, who had no interest in the matter--but I was unable to understand the passive position maintained by the lawyer. He enlightened my ignorance in two words.|$|E
6000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{apparition}} on <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> was utterly appalling. Cedric started {{back as far as}} the wall of the apartment would permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed on the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth which he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself, repeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred to his memory, while Richard alternately said, [...] "Benedicite", and swore, [...] "Mort de ma vie!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} why {{she wants to see}} me, uncle?" [...] said Gwendolen, whose mind had quickly gone over various reasons that an {{imaginary}} Mrs. Mompert with three daughters might be supposed to entertain, reasons all of a disagreeable kind to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>presenting</b> herself for inspection.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> other <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> testified their {{unanimous}} acquiescence in what Sir Richard Glendale had said.|$|R
5000|$|The common phrase [...] "I don't know" [...] uses {{a special}} {{negative}} form of <b>the</b> first <b>person</b> <b>present.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the room. The eyes of all <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> turned more or less anxiously on Julian. Mercy was vaguely {{surprised}} and alarmed. Horace, like Lady Janet, felt offended, without clearly knowing why. Even Grace Roseberry herself was subdued by her own presentiment of some coming interference for which she was completely unprepared. Julian's words and actions, from {{the moment when he}} had written on the card, were involved in a mystery to which not one of the persons round him held the clew.|$|E
6000|$|Introduced to Number Fourteen, {{the doctor}} looked round {{him with a}} certain {{appearance}} of interest which was noticed by everyone present. 'The last time I was in this room,' he said, 'was on a melancholy occasion. It was before the palace was changed into an hotel. I was in professional attendance on an English nobleman who died here.' One of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present</b> inquired {{the name of the}} nobleman. Doctor Bruno answered (without the slightest suspicion that he was speaking before a brother of the dead man), 'Lord Montbarry.' ...|$|E
60|$|A great {{portion of}} their time is passed in revelry, music, dancing, and gambling. Their music {{scarcely}} deserves the name; the instruments being of the rudest kind. Their singing is harsh and discordant; the songs are chiefly extempore, relating to passing circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>present,</b> or any trifling object that strikes {{the attention of the}} singer. They have several kinds of dances, some of them lively and pleasing. The women are rarely permitted to dance with the men, but form groups apart, dancing to the same instrument and song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses to tell Israelites {{that when they}} would present a bull for a burnt {{offering}} to God, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>the</b> offering was also to bring flour mixed with oil and wine. And when a resident alien wanted to present an offering, the same law would apply.|$|R

2500|$|A {{particular}} {{convention in}} illuminated manuscripts was the [...] "presentation portrait", where the manuscript {{began with a}} figure, often kneeling, presenting the manuscript to its owner, or sometimes the owner commissioning the book.
