25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E

He has said, [...] "If somebody's doing that for entertainment purposes, that's one thing.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The title {{originally}} started development under GRIN, who {{had developed}} the previous title. [...] When the company folded four months into development, Fatshark took over, having worked with GRIN previously on other games. [...] Some key employees worked with Fatshark following {{the closing of}} GRIN. [...] Simon Viklund, Creative Director on the first Rearmed {{was hired as a}} Creative Advisor to the Fatshark team. [...] Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked [...] "They were taking over things mid-project and I worked as a creative advisor during the hand-over to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking at." [...] Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. [...] "I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. [...] a nice way to convey that now everyone will see that bionics can't always be controlled." [...] He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them.|$|E
2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

5000|$|Estimating {{the demand}} for {{products}} or services in emerging markets and developing economies can be complex and challenging for managers.

5000|$|The {{downside}} of negative criticism is, often, that it tells people <b>what</b> <b>they</b> cannot {{or should not}} do or believe, rather than <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can or should do (what possibilities or options there are). So it may be disabling, rather than enabling. People might reply to a negative criticism that [...] "this is all very well, but I cannot do anything with it", or they might say [...] "now what?!". Yet, negative criticism may be necessary at times, to prevent {{a course of action}} harmful to the people concerned. If people are afraid to state a negative criticism, the existing problem might get worse.|$|R

Nevertheless, she found their methodology and interpretation of data open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, {{that they did not}} sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought they wanted to hear, and that they relegated the fact that respondents who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote.

60|$|To an {{observer}} of men, {{the end of}} this affair presented several strong points for comment. As soon as the truth became generally known, in reference to the real ownership, and the public came to ascertain that instead of hitherto possessing a right, it had, in fact been merely enjoying a favour, those who had commit ted themselves by their arrogant assumptions of facts, and their indecent outrages, fell back on their self-love, and began to find excuses for their conduct in that of the other party. Mr. Effingham was loudly condemned for not having done the very thing, he, in truth, had done, viz: telling the public it did not own his property; and when this was shown to be an absurdity, the complaint followed that what he had done, had been done in precisely such a mode, although it was the mode constantly used by every one else. From these vague and indefinite accusations, those most implicated in the wrong, began to deny all their own original assertions, by insisting that they had known all along, that Mr. Effingham owned the property, but that they did not choose he, or any other man, should presume to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> knew already. In short, {{the end of this}} affair exhibited human nature in its usual aspects of prevarication, untruth, contradiction, and inconsistency, notwithstanding the high profession of liberty made by those implicated; and they who had been the most guilty of wrong, were loudest in their complaints, as if they alone had suffered.|$|E
60|$|Yet I do {{not deny}} that such {{scientific}} nomenclature has its uses; and I should be far from undervaluing this side of Mrs. Creevey's book. In fact, I secretly respect it the more for its botanical lore, and if ever I get into the woods or fields again I mean {{to go up to}} some of the humblest flowers, such as I can feel myself on easy terms with, and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are in Latin. I think it will surprise them, and I dare say they will some of them like it, and will want their initials inscribed on their leaves, like those signatures which the medicinal plants bear, or are supposed to bear. But as long as I am engaged in their culture amid this stone and iron and asphalt, I find it best to invite their presence by their familiar names, and I hope they will not think them too familiar. I should like to get them all naturalized here, so that the thousands of poor city children, who never saw them growing in their native places, might have some notion of how bountifully the world is equipped with beauty, and how it is governed by many laws which are not enforced by policemen. I think that would interest them very much, and I shall not mind their plucking my Barmecide blossoms, and carrying them home by the armfuls. When good-will costs nothing we ought to practise it even with the tramps, and these are very welcome, in their wanderings over the city pave, to rest their weary limbs in any of my pleached bowers they come to.|$|E

Spyler and CeCe then start searching for the items. After each item is found they sing their [...] "Whoop! We Found It!" [...] song. Duck arrives again and <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have found and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need to find in rhyme. Spyler also calls for Wheeler to take their stuff home.

5000|$|Edsel Ford Fong {{was born}} and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown. He worked the second floor of the Sam Wo Restaurant on Washington Street. (The {{restaurant}} name means [...] "three in peace", a reference to its founding partners.) As head waiter, Fong greeted visitors with an admonition to [...] "Sit down and shut up!" [...] He was known for calling patrons [...] "retarded" [...] and [...] "fat", criticizing people's menu choices and then <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should order, slamming food on the table, and complaining about receiving only 15% tips. An imposing man with a crew cut hair style, he also was notorious for seating people with strangers, forgetting orders, cursing, spilling soup on customers, hazing newcomers, refusing to provide forks or English menu translations, and busing tables before diners were finished.|$|R
60|$|The great God, {{instead of}} giving the ungodly any ease, will even {{aggravate}} their torments; first, by slighting their perplexities, and by <b>telling</b> of <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> must be thinking of.

60|$|Now the {{students}} of heredity, especially, understand all of their subject except their subject. They were, I suppose, bred and born in that brier-patch, and have really explored it without coming {{to the end of}} it. That is, they have studied everything but the question of what they are studying. Now I do not propose to rely merely on myself to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are studying. I propose, as will be seen in a moment, to call the testimony of a great man who has himself studied it. But to begin with, the domain of heredity (for those who see its frontiers) is a sort of triangle, enclosed on its three sides by three facts. The first is that heredity undoubtedly exists, or there would be {{no such thing as a}} family likeness, and every marriage might suddenly produce a small negro. The second is that even simple heredity can never be simple; its complexity must be literally unfathomable, for in that field fight unthinkable millions. But yet again it never is simple heredity: for the instant anyone is, he experiences. The third is that these innumerable ancient influences, these instant inundations of experiences, come together according to a combination that is unlike anything else on this earth. It is a combination that does combine. It cannot be sorted out again, even on the Day of Judgment. Two totally different people have become in the sense most sacred, frightful, and unanswerable, one flesh. If a golden-haired Scandinavian girl has married a very swarthy Jew, the Scandinavian side of the family may say till they are blue in the face that the baby has his mother's nose or his mother's eyes. They can never be certain the black-haired Bedouin is not present in every feature, in every inch. In the person of the baby he may have gently pulled his wife's nose. In the person of the baby he may have partly blacked his wife's eyes.|$|E
60|$|And {{it is to}} {{be noted}} that it is the fact that Art is this intense form of Individualism that makes the public try to {{exercise}} over it an authority that is as immoral as it is ridiculous, and as corrupting as it is contemptible. It is not quite their fault. The public has always, and in every age, been badly brought up. They are continually asking Art to be popular, to please their want of taste, to flatter their absurd vanity, to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have been told before, to show them what they ought to be tired of seeing, to amuse them when they feel heavy after eating too much, and to distract their thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity. Now Art should never try to be popular. The public should try to make itself artistic. There is a very wide difference. If a man of science were told that the results of his experiments, and the conclusions that he arrived at, should be of such a character that they would not upset the received popular notions on the subject, or disturb popular prejudice, or hurt the sensibilities of people who knew nothing about science; if a philosopher were told that he had a perfect right to speculate in the highest spheres of thought, provided that he arrived at the same conclusions as were held by those who had never thought in any sphere at all--well, nowadays the man of science and the philosopher would be considerably amused. Yet it is really a very few years since both philosophy and science were subjected to brutal popular control, to authority in fact--the authority of either the general ignorance of the community, or the terror and greed for power of an ecclesiastical or governmental class. Of course, we have to a very great extent got rid of any attempt {{on the part of the}} community, or the Church, or the Government, to interfere with the individualism of speculative thought, but the attempt to interfere with the individualism of imaginative art still lingers. In fact, it does more than linger; it is aggressive, offensive, and brutalising.|$|E

2500|$|LaVey {{believed}} that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting {{what he called the}} [...] "colorless existence" [...] that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it. He praised the human ego for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires. He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait, and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival. Accordingly, he praised the Seven Deadly Sins as virtues which were beneficial for the individual. The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in The Black Flame, in which one writer described [...] "a true Satanic society" [...] as one in which the population consists of [...] "free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' <b>them</b> or <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can and cannot do." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} orders, merchants {{would send}} a review emails to consumers. Some of those emails are <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have bought before, some are post-purchase survey, etc. Before consumers make purchase decisions, they are heavily rely on the customer reviews about the products. Here is an example. Sephora, a leading beauty retailer, thanks the customer for their recent purchase while simultaneously asking them to review their new products. Within the email they also give the shopper an additional reason to engage by promoting other content resources including Sephora TV and beauty news.This review campaign appears to be extremely successful. In addition, {{in the first quarter}} of 2015, the read rate for these campaigns was 58% higher than their average read rate and the deleted unread percentage was 44% lower.
