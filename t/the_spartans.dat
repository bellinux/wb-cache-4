5|$|After a brief {{engagement}} between Thebes and Phocis, {{in which}} Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces {{met at the}} dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> and their allies lost only 1,100.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to <b>the</b> <b>Spartans,</b> based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> chases {{and catches}} up to him, trying to thrust his spear again. The Ninja dodges and breaks the spear in half with his sickle. He tries to stab <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> with <b>the</b> broken spear, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> blocks with his shield. This time, <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> swings his shield and sends the Ninja flying back. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> unsheathes his short sword and {{advances}} towards the Ninja. The Ninja pulls out a black egg and waits for <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> to get close. He then jumps in front of <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> kicks <b>the</b> shield, and throws the egg at the Spartan's face. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> blindly swings at the air as the Ninja back-flips off the shield and retreats. When <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> regains his vision, he sees the Ninja running away and pursues him.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> {{stands in}} a forest, spear and shield in hand. Hidden in the treetops above, the Ninja watches him. He quietly jumps down and sneaks up behind <b>the</b> <b>Spartan.</b> As he approaches, he draws his ninjato. When close enough, he yells and swings his sword. Alerted, <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> quickly blocks <b>the</b> sword with his shield. He turns and thrusts his spear, but the Ninja rolls away {{to hide in the}} thick grass. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> thrusts his javelin into the ground for later use. He hears the Ninja and turns to see him {{spinning}} the ball and chain of his kusarigama. He throws the ball at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> who blocks with his shield. The Ninja starts to swing his kusarigama again, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> charges with <b>the</b> spear and misses. The Ninja swings the ball at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> again but, as before, <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> blocks with his shield. He swings it around a third time, but at the Spartan's leg. The chain wraps around and trips <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> sending him to <b>the</b> floor. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> sits up and grabs the chain. The Ninja tries to pull the kusarigama away from <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> keeps a firm grip. In a desperate move, the Ninja breaks the kusarigama’s chain and rushes at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> with <b>the</b> remaining sickle part. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> knocks him away with his shield and gets back up. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> tries to stab him with his spear, but the Ninja kicks the shield and runs away.|$|R
50|$|The battle {{begins with}} the Samurai walking through a forest with his Naginata and Yumi Bow in his hands. As he is walking, <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> emerges from behind a giant rock and eyes the Samurai. The Samurai, sensing danger, thrusts his Naginata {{into the ground and}} watches <b>the</b> <b>Spartan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> grunts and holds out his Javelin, ready for battle. The Samurai takes an arrow and fires at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> jumps down from the rock and towards the Samurai, {{knocking}} the arrow away with his Spartan Shield. He throws the Javelin at the Samurai, but aims too high and misses completely. The Samurai readies another arrow while <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> pulls out his Spear and charges at the Samurai. At the last second, the Samurai aims for the Spartan's legs and shoots, but it goes in between them and hits <b>the</b> floor. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> tries to hit the Samurai with his Spear, but the Samurai dodges and picks up his Naginata. The two begin swinging at each other until the Samurai hits his shield. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> uses <b>the</b> Shield as a wall and shoves the Samurai {{all the way up to}} a tree. The Samurai tries to stab <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> with <b>the</b> Naginata, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> parries with his Spear and breaks the Naginata in two with his Shield. The Samurai, undeterred, grabs the Spartan's Spear and flips over <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> causing him to release the Spear. The Samurai throws it away and pulls out his Kanabo club. He starts to viciously swing at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> uses his shield to cover his body and block the blows. The Samurai stops briefly to regain his strength, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> draws his Short Sword and stabs the Samurai's ear. The Samurai shrieks in pain, backs away and checks his ear for blood. Meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> now very angry, gets back up and starts advancing towards the Samurai. The two stop in the middle of a field while the Samurai grabs a hold of the handle of his Katana. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> makes his move first and thrusts the Short Sword at the Samurai, but the Samurai dodges and swings his Katana. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan,</b> however, blocks it with his Shield and shoves the Samurai away. The two stand off again, and <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> once again tries to stab the Samurai. The Samurai avoids it and again tries to hit <b>the</b> <b>Spartan,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> blocks and hits the Samurai with his Shield. The Samurai gets up and readies himself and his Katana. The Samurai makes a quick thrust at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> in an attempt to finish him off. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan,</b> however, effortlessly blocks again with the Shield and thrusts his Short Sword. It cuts into the Samurai's stomach and leaves him frozen in place. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> swings <b>the</b> Shield into the Samurai's face and knocks him to <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> walks up to him and thrusts the Short Sword into the Samurai's neck, killing him. He pulls out the sword and watches as blood spurts from the Samurai's neck. He raises his Short Sword in the air and roars in victory.|$|R
5|$|News of the Spartan defeat, accordingly, was a {{profound}} shock to Agesilaus, who soon {{returned home to}} Sparta. In the months following Agesilaus' departure, Iphicrates reversed many of the gains that <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> had made near Corinth, recapturing three of the forts that <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> had previously seized and garrisoned. He also launched several successful raids against Spartan allies in the region. Although <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> and their oligarchic allies continued to hold Lechaeum {{for the duration of}} the war, they curtailed their operations around Corinth, and no further major fighting occurred in the region.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of the {{relieving}} force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia. However, he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos. Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity, Antigonus took his army to Argos, being harried along the way by <b>the</b> <b>Spartans.</b> Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing mêlée, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece.|$|E
5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging <b>the</b> <b>Spartans,</b> Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' hope was that his son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time to extricate the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was set upon by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with <b>the</b> <b>Spartans.</b> However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> {{finds himself}} in a deeper, darker part of the forest. He slowly walks through the trees, javelin in hand, shield up, looking for the Ninja. The Ninja pops {{out from behind a}} tree and tries to shoots him with his blowgun. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> blocks <b>the</b> darts and throws his javelin. The javelin lands off-target, {{allowing}} the Ninja to run away. He pulls out some shurikens and turns to throw them, only to find that <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> has caught up. He quickly throws one, but the shield protects <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> as he knocks over <b>the</b> Ninja. <b>The</b> <b>Spartan</b> unsheathes his short sword again and swings at the Ninja, who dodges. The Ninja jumps onto a tree and prepares to leap at <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> with his sword, but <b>the</b> <b>Spartan</b> impales <b>the</b> Ninja on his sword and pins him to the tree, stabbing him to death and yelling [...] "Sparta".|$|R

5|$|Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors {{to allow}} him to {{continue}} his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of Leuctra. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based nearest the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> across the ravine, but Lydiadas of Megalopolis disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>Spartans.</b> Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. <b>The</b> <b>Spartans,</b> encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers.

5|$|Once the Persians {{discovered}} that the Greeks had abandoned their positions {{and appeared to be}} in retreat, Mardonius decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite Persian infantry.

The rearguard under Amompharetus began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from Persian cavalry, to join them. Pausanias sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with <b>the</b> <b>Spartans.</b> However, the Athenians had been engaged by the Theban phalanx and were unable to assist Pausanias. <b>The</b> <b>Spartans</b> and Tegeans were first assaulted by the Persian cavalry, while the Persian infantry made their way forward.

5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> with other contingents.

The right wing thus began fighting with the Persians while the left wing was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gythium {{was fought}} in 195 BC between Sparta and the {{coalition}} of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. <b>The</b> <b>Spartans</b> held out {{but one of the}} joint commanders, Dexagoridas, decided to surrender the city to the Roman legate. When Gorgopas, the other commander, found out, he killed Dexagoridas and took solo command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> held out more vigorously. However, Titus Quinctius Flamininus of the allied forces arrived with 4,000 more men and <b>the</b> <b>Spartans</b> decided to surrender the city on the condition that the garrison could leave unharmed.
