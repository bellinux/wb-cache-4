[...] Aware that his mother had been watching the game on TV, he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her. Then he asked for a priest.|$|E
5000|$|Angel's {{recording}} {{career began}} when she sent an email to producer Mikal Blue {{who has also}} worked with Colbie Caillat, Brendan James, and Jason Reeves and this resulted in an invitation to his studio, Revolver Studios. [...] "I played two songs, 'Chai' and 'It's Easy,' {{and he said he}} wanted to work with me — I told him all I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> my music on a CD, and asked him how long that was going to take, and he said, 'Oh no, I want to really work with you....'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... the {{gameplay}} is {{more action}} horror. We have built {{on all the}} elements of survival horror games in the past, but what we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> away from the slow [...] "plodding for hours" [...] style of gameplay, which made us more likely to fall asleep than wet our pants from fear. So we made the shooting aspects more frenzied in order to really wake the player up. So when we do slow the pace back down, your sense that any minute it might get hairy again really starts to mess with you.|$|E

Brumby admits that he was involved in the murder, and warns Jack that killing him will force him to run {{for the rest of his}} life. As Brumby is walking away Carter calls out to him, but Brumby says he won't turn around. Jack shoots him in the back.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after getting}} out of jail, Thomas {{connected}} with several local musicians. He played {{in a series of}} cover bands and began writing songs in earnest. Thomas said that [...] "in songwriting I felt special for the first time. And all I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> out of Florida." [...] One of his bands, Fair Warning, earned a three-week job playing at a hotel in Vero Beach. They were fired three days into the job, after they were caught stealing beer and candy from the hotel.

The balloon was very light and had no internal pressure so it was hard getting the balloon to settle down. I flew probably five miles over nothing but solid woods. I wasn’t worried about getting the balloon down, but I was worried that I might damage the balloon. So I said to myself I should take {{it all the way to}} the shoreline, then I thought better of it and decided I had the record, the thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> down, be safe and get it over with." ...|$|E

On first down Robert Newhouse lost a yard. On second down, a screen pass to Tony Hill only gained a yard. On third down Staubach was rushed and he rolled out to his right and was tackled for no gain. In the process of stopping the Cowboys from getting a first down the Rams also used their last two timeouts and the Cowboys were forced to punt for the eighth time in the game.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the success}} of Soft Cell, in particular, Stevo began to have immense clout with the major record companies. Johnson and Laws had {{released}} the single [...] "Cold Spell Ahead" [...] on the independent side of Some Bizzare but later Stevo dealt with Decca Records, who paid for Johnson to re-record the song with producer Mike Thorne in New York. The clever thing that Stevo had managed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> Decca {{to pay for the}} recordings while still keeping ownership of the recordings. This was {{a good example of how}} Stevo dealt with the large major recording companies at the time. After Johnson had completed the recordings Stevo began dealing with both Decca and CBS for a record deal. The deal famously went to CBS with a bizarre contract signing in Trafalgar Square.|$|E

[...] Brockman had known Sajak since the two worked for NBC in the late 1970s. At that time, Brockman had approached Sajak, a weatherman, about doing a game show, but Sajak rejected the idea, saying what he really wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> a talk show. Brockman kept him in mind over the years, and at a lunch in 1986 he reminded Sajak about the conversation. Sajak confirmed his interest in a talk show, and Brockman went to work getting approvals from his management for the plan and getting network affiliates to commit to the show.|$|E

I was just getting ready to go to Europe on some sort of a business trip... to meet somebody to discuss something about Marvel. And I think I wasn't thinking too clearly, because when they said, 'We'd like to kill Gwen Stacy,' I said, 'Well, if that's what you want to do, okay.' All I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> them out of the office so I could finish packing and get out of there. ... and when I came back and found out that Gwen had been killed, I thought 'Why would they do that? Why would Gerry write anything like that?' And I had to be reminded later on that I had perhaps reluctantly or perhaps carelessly said 'Okay' when they asked me." ...|$|E

Shooting over the winter of 2011/2 {{on the streets of}} London and at Abbey Road Studios, it was an attempt to move the character from the stage to the screen. The film-maker Mat Snead has said of the film: [...] "I think what I {{wanted to do was to}} try and take Wilfredo off stage and almost push the absurdity of it by showing him in a real world environment. Wilfredo really does exist on stage, so what I was trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> him off stage and get him into some different environments and do some things that you can’t do on stage. I’ve seen a lot of those kinds of acts, but there are very few that can actually pull it off." ...|$|E
5000|$|The protest resumed on Monday 3 September, {{the first}} day of the Autumn school term. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (over the summer the RUC had {{undergone}} a name change), supported by the British Army, were by then better prepared and managed to force a path through the protesters. Loyalists jeered and shouted sectarian abuse as the children, some as young as four, were escorted into the school by their parents and the police. Stones and bottles were thrown at the children and their parents; one woman was injured. A mother of one of the schoolgirls said: [...] "It was absolutely terrifying. They were shouting 'dirty tramps', 'your kids are animals', 'Fenian scum', 'you Fenian bastards'. And all we were trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> our kids to school". Unionist politicians claimed a [...] "heavy-handed" [...] police presence had inflamed the situation, while the Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson alleged that five known IRA men had been allowed to walk with the children through the Protestant area.|$|E

Vickers after the race Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane to celebrate his first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate ... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help ... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient."

50|$|Almost {{three months}} later, Briony discovers that she’s pregnant. Before {{she can get}} over that shock, her doctor tries to drug her and kidnap her. She and her brother escape and go on the run. Twice more {{enhanced}} soldiers find her and try to “return her to the lab”. Then a man calling himself Kaden Montague appears and shows her a file of her life. The story told to her adoptive family is a lie; she is not {{the daughter of a}} man whose wife died in childbirth. She is one of several orphaned girls who have been psychically and physically enhanced by a man named Peter Whitney. She was given to her family because he wanted to see if she was tough enough to survive the constant bombardment of human emotion without an anchor (a psychic who can filter strong emotion). Not only was that, but the overwhelming attraction between Jack and Briony is no accident. Whitney designed pheromones that would insure strong physical compatibility. All he needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> them both at the same place at the time and nature would take care of the rest. All of this was done so that Briony and Jack would be the parents of the second generation of Whitney’s supersoldiers.|$|E
5000|$|One More Day was {{recorded}} in 18 months. The band discussed their take of the album on Arista's website in 2000. [...] "We feel like we've got the best group of songs that we've ever had on record," [...] says Dana Williams. [...] "Every time we do a record, we feel that way - if you don't, then there's something wrong." [...] The group made {{a conscious effort to}} conquer new musical territory with this project. [...] "Part of what we set out to do on this record was to do something that we hadn't done before, and try to approach things in a different manner," [...] says Gene Johnson. [...] "Dana and I approached the harmony vocals differently. In fact, {{we did a lot of}} harmony vocals on this album; there's not a whole lot of Marty by himself." [...] Gene continues, [...] "We have unique instrumentation, and we're all distinctive players. So one of the things we didn't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> too much light material. We wanted it to be pretty serious." [...] The album's intended title was to be [...] "Stuff" [...] after the lead-off single's title.

5000|$|On {{the second}} day of the ground war, General Norman Schwarzkopf {{publicly}} expressed frustration over what he characterized as VII Corps' slow pace, allowing elements of the Republican Guard to escape destruction by fleeing toward Basra. Gen Franks ( [...] then a Lt. Gen [...] ) later gave his reasons for the slow pace to a documentary filmmaker. He said that [...] "I was thinking of forty eight hours ahead. I wanted to be in a posture that when we hit the Republican Guard, that we would hit them with a fist massed from an unexpected direction at full speed, and so what I needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> the corps in a posture that would allow this to happen." [...] He also worried about friendly fire in the fluid opening phase of ground operations. In his memoir, Franks criticized Schwarzkopf as a career infantryman who had little feel for the maneuvering of armoured formations and for being a [...] "chateau general" [...] by trying to run the war from a bunker 400 miles to the south in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [...] General Franks is credited in United States Air Force history in bringing modern day ISR capabilities to the fight. After witnessing a demonstration of JSTARS in exercise Deep Strike in Germany, Franks positive impression led to him raving about the capability to Gen Schwarzkopf. JSTARS proved indispensable in proving the JFACC with real-time intelligence and targeting information on advancing and retreating Iraqi ground Forces.|$|E

Aside from Hopper, the rest of the band were not completely comfortable with the recording process as they thought that playing in a studio was [...] "a bit more surgical then just playing live." [...] Jones recalled that [...] "because so much of what they did was visual, one of the things I do remember is that, when we were doing vocals with Mick he kind of almost had to turn himself inside out to exaggerate what he was doing to the point where it seemed funny just by listening to it rather than having the additional benefit of seeing him jerking himself around." [...] Hopper recalled that the recording sessions, and this entire era of the band, were [...] "a happy exciting time. The influences we all brought to the band were working well at this point, even though our democratic writing and rehearsal process was tortuously slow." [...] It had taken the band months to [...] "fashion all the wobbly noises, tumbling drums and lyrics into songs, and unlike most bands, the band contributed equally. Hopper recalled [...] "there was no songwriter coming in with a guitar showing everyone the chords. Instead, we relied on a fine balance of each other’s discrete musical contributions." ...|$|E
