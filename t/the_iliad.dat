5|$|The Firebrand is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set {{in the ancient}} city of Troy, the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, <b>the</b> <b>Iliad.</b> The Firebrand is written {{from the point of}} view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in <b>the</b> <b>Iliad,</b> Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. <b>The</b> <b>Iliad,</b> possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{information}} offered by the Greek epics and especially by Homer's epics, <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> and Odyssey, this time period of Greek history {{was regarded as a}} period of warrior-heroes who led various military campaigns in Greece and adjacent areas. The picture of the Mycenaean Greeks in the Homeric Epics is one of a quarrelsome people and of a warrior Ã©lite to whom personal honor was the highest value.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{territory}} and its inhabitants, the Achaeans, {{one of the}} names that Homer {{used to refer to}} the Greeks in <b>the</b> <b>Iliad.</b> Historically important about the Achaeans in the time of Attarsiya is that they undertook an expedition to Anatolia, as well as Cyprus. The latter expedition indicates that the Achaean leader commanded a significant fleet and that the Achaeans were a sea power.|$|E
5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point.

5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultures}} of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, animal stereotypes grew until {{by the time of}} Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion simile {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In <b>the</b> <b>Iliad,</b> Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E

However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.|$|E

5000|$|The Aethiopis or Aithiopis (Greek: , Aithiopis; Aethiopis) is a lost epic {{of ancient}} Greek literature. It {{was one of}} the Epic Cycle, that is, the [...] "Trojan" [...] cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the Aethiopis comes {{chronologically}} immediately after that of <b>the</b> Homeric <b>Iliad,</b> and is followed by that of <b>the</b> Little <b>Iliad.</b> <b>The</b> Aethiopis was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (see Cyclic poets).

5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>Iliad,</b> the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control {{are based on the}} use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|Troilus' {{death was}} also {{described}} in the Cypria, one of {{the parts of the}} Epic Cycle that is no longer extant. The poem covered the events preceding the Trojan War and {{the first part of the}} war itself up to the events of <b>the</b> <b>Iliad.</b> Although the Cypria does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought to be by Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (phoneuei) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.|$|E

The story of <b>the</b> Little <b>Iliad</b> comes {{chronologically}} after that of the Aethiopis, and is followed by that of the Iliou persis ("Sack of Troy"). <b>The</b> Little <b>Iliad</b> was variously attributed by ancient writers to Lesches of Pyrrha, Cinaethon of Sparta, Diodorus of Erythrae, Thestorides of Phocaea, or Homer himself (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised four books of verse in dactylic hexameter, the heroic meter.|$|R

50|$|The {{emergence}} of the heroes from the horse, and the Greeks' destruction of Troy, seem not to be recounted in <b>the</b> Little <b>Iliad,</b> but are left for the Iliou persis.

5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmÃªn is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance {{and the advent of}} the first English translation of <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> in the form of Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{culminates in}} the Trojan War, fought between Greece and Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer's works, such as <b>the</b> <b>Iliad,</b> the chief stories {{have already taken}} shape and substance, and {{individual}} themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a Trojan hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.|$|E

25|$|The Aeneid can {{be divided}} into two halves based on the {{disparate}} subject matter of Books 1â6 (Aeneas's journey to Latium in Italy) and Books 7â12 (the war in Latium). These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil's ambition to rival Homer by treating both the Odyssey's wandering theme and <b>the</b> <b>Iliads</b> warfare themes. This is, however, a rough correspondence, the limitations of which should be borne in mind.|$|R
5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all these}} fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most is}} known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to <b>the</b> <b>Iliad</b> states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E
5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in <b>the</b> <b>Iliad,</b> and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
40|$|In {{this guide}} we pick {{our way through}} a range of themes and issues that help {{negotiate}} the distance between Homerâs time and our own: the question of who, or what, Homer is and how to approach reading his poetry (the Introduction); the epic cosmos that Homer inherits, challenges and changes forever (Ch. 1); <b>the</b> <b>Iliadâs</b> examination of politics through its depiction of the Achaeansâ coalition against the Trojans (Ch. 2); its emotional core that invites the audience inside Troy to experience war from the âotherâ perspective (Ch. 3); the disarming humanity of <b>the</b> <b>Iliadâs</b> final vision of the meeting of godlike Achilles {{and the old man}} whose son he has killed (Ch. 4); the Odysseyâs rollercoaster ride through epic as we catch up on what has been happening since the fall of Troy (Ch. 5); a storytelling master-class from Odysseus himself including his great escape from the cave of the Cyclops (Ch. 6); the Odysseyâs show-stopping finale as Odysseus takes on the suitors (Ch. 7); and a brief tour through many receptions of Homer from Greek tragedy to science fiction (the Epilogue) ...|$|R
