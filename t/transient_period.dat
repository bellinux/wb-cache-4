These <b>transient</b> <b>periods</b> occur in a background of stochastic motion. We employ a quantitative method to identify these <b>transient</b> <b>periods</b> within individual trajectories (Huet et al., 2006). Linear filtering using a moving average isolates the trend in a time series (Diggle, 1994). The trend in nuclear position was measured using an equally weighted moving average over a window of t ± 5 / 6 minutes. A moving analysis window (± 14 / 15 minutes, matched to the approximate duration of <b>transient</b> movement <b>periods),</b> scans {{the full length of}} the trajectory and assigns a score to the central time point of each subtrajectory, where the score is the slope of the trend over the subtrajectory (evaluated by linear regression). Because random walks can temporarily mimic directed movement, the method used to identify non-random movement periods must incorporate a threshold to exclude false positives (Saxton, 1994). The threshold is selected through analysis of simulated random walk controls. One thousand one-dimensional random walks of one hundred steps were simulated using steps randomly sampled from a gaussian distribution fitted by maximum likelihood to the nuclear displacement distribution from control embryos. The transient {{motion analysis}} algorithm was applied to random walk controls, and the threshold was set so that a random walk subtrajectory would have negligible probability (< 0. 01) of being identified as nonrandom motion. Mean squared displacement calculation and model fitting Where δt is the time interval between consecutive measurements of nuclear position, the mean squared displacement for time lag Δt = n δt (where n is an integer), may be calculated for an individual trajectory by averaging over all pairs of time points Δt apart (Qian et al. ...|$|R

Current {{activities in the}} field of public lighting research and standardization are focused on establishment of energy efficiency numerical indicator based on installed power, target photometric parameters and operation time.

Because {{of the length of}} the pipelines the models are mostly one-dimensional (1 D) which in turn requires input parameters like a friction factor and heat transfer coefficients. These parameters are usually the result of steady state correlations. There are doubts about the validity of using steady state correlation in <b>transient</b> <b>periods.</b> The objective of this thesis was to simulate <b>transient</b> <b>periods</b> with an one-dimensional (1 D) model and a more detailed two-dimensional (2 D) model from a commercial CFD package, extracting the friction factor and then comparing the resulting friction factors from the two models. The RANS k-ω model was chosen from a set of criteria. To limit the computational demand, periodic boundary conditions were used at the inlet and the outlet of the pipe-segment and the flow was simplified to be isothermal, incompressible, and with constant viscosity. Furthermore, an 1 D model was derived and three different friction models were implemented, namely the quasi-steady friction model, the Instantaneous Acceleration Based (IAB) Daily et al. model, and the Vardy et al. friction model. <b>Transient</b> <b>periods,</b> defined as ramp-up and ramp-down flows, were simulated by the models. Ramp-up and ramp-down transients are seen as a sudden increase or decrease in pressure difference, resembling a valve opening or closing.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is Current Transformer Transient {{response}} study using an electromagnetic Transient program (EMTP). Current transformers are considered eyes for power system protection. Behaviours of protection systems depend largely on information fed to them by instrument transformers. Ferromagnetic current transformers have for many years provided practical method of current measurement, however there are limitations associated with current transformer operation:- notably, difficult in maintaining accuracy over {{the full range of}} operating conditions, and most particularly current transformers tendency to suffer saturation of iron core during severe faults, with accompanying severe ratio or loss of output. These limitations might lead to mal operation of protective relays due to distorted inputs from current transformers particularly in <b>transient</b> <b>periods.</b> This thesis involved studying the behaviour of current transformers in both steady state and <b>transient</b> <b>periods.</b> An emphasis being put on <b>transient</b> <b>periods</b> which are very crucial in behaviour of current transformers because transformation errors are greatest in these periods. Errors in current transformer transformation might affect operation of entire protection schemes. Maloperation of current transformers in <b>transient</b> <b>periods</b> have very bad effect on relay co-ordination and worst condition might be failure of protection scheme operation altogether. Over the past decades engineers have been trying to develop a current transformer model that would represent a current transformer well in <b>transient</b> <b>periods.</b> It has proved to be rather difficult {{to come up with a}} single detailed model that would satisfy all possible conditions. This is due to non-linearity of magnetising curve and saturation effects of current transformer iron cores. The author has considered different current transformer models with their merits and demerits being highlighted. It has been shown that different current transformer models have to be used when considering different operating conditions of a current transformer in a power system. ATP-EMTP an Electromagnetic Transient Program was developed in the sixties for the study of electromagnetic transients in power systems. It has proved to be a very useful tool in this regard. The program development is still going on today to accommodate a wide application in power systems. Several components have been developed to represent different components in a power system. It is only recently that there has been a growing interest to include modelling of protective equipment. This has been accelerated by the inclusion of MODELS in the EMTP program. This thesis explores the effect of transients taking into account different conditions like transient fault currents, effects of high frequency waves and surges. Effects of different types of burdens on current transformers were explored as well. Due to limitations of EMTP, simulation results are only applicable to current transformers with ARMCO M 4 oriented steel with ungapped cores. The author arrived at several conclusions. The most important conclusion is that mal operation of protective relays due to current transformer saturation can be avoided easily if proper current transformer selection is given priority in power protection design. EMTP package proved to be very useful and handy when studying transients though one has to be careful with numerical oscillations which might be present during simulations. Problems of numerical oscillations have been discussed under current transformer simulation tools...|$|R
