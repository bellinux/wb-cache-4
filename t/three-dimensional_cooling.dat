40|$|A laser-cooling {{scheme for}} {{molecules}} is presented based on repeated cycle of zero-velocity selection, deceleration, and irreversible accumulation. Although this scheme also employs a single spontaneous emission as in [Raymond Ooi, Marzlin, and Audretsch, Eur. Phys. J. D 22, 259 (2003) ], {{in order to}} circumvent the difficulty of maintaining closed pumping cycles in molecules, there are two distinct features which make the cooling process of this scheme faster and more practical. First, the zero-velocity selection creates a narrow velocity-width population with zero mean velocity, such that no further deceleration (with many stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) pulses) is required. Second, only two STIRAP processes are required to decelerate the remaining hot molecular ensemble to create a finite population around zero velocity for the next cycle. We present a setup to realize the cooling process in one dimension with trapping {{in the other two}} dimensions using a Stark barrel. Numerical estimates of the cooling parameters and simulations with density matrix equations using OH molecules show the applicability of the cooling scheme. For a gas at temperature T = 1 K, the estimated cooling time is only 2 ms, with phase-space density increased by about 30 times.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{interaction between}} light and atoms is an extensive {{field of study}} with {{a broad range of}} applications in quantum information science and condensed matter physics. Nonlinear optical phenomena occurring in cold atoms are particularly interesting because such slowly moving atoms can spatially organize into density gratings, which allows for studies involving optical interactions with structured materials. In this thesis, I describe a novel nonlinear optical effect that arises when cold atoms spatially bunch in an optical lattice. I show that employing this spatial atomic bunching provides access to a unique physical regime with reduced thresholds for nonlinear optical processes and enhanced material properties. Using this method, I observe the nonlinear optical phenomenon of transverse optical pattern formation at record-low powers. These transverse optical patterns are generated by a wave- mixing process that is mediated by the cold atomic vapor. The optical patterns are highly multimode and induce rich non-equilibrium atomic dynamics. In particular, I find that there exists a synergistic interplay between the generated optical pat- terns and the atoms, wherein the scattered fields help the atoms to self-organize into new, multimode structures that are not externally imposed on the atomic sample. These self-organized structures in turn enhance the power in the optical patterns. I provide the first detailed investigation of the motional dynamics of atoms that have self-organized in a multimode geometry. I also show that the transverse optical patterns induce Sisyphus cooling in all three spatial dimensions, which is the first observation of spontaneous <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>cooling.</b> My experiment represents a unique means by which to study nonlinear optics and non-equilibrium dynamics at ultra-low required powers.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of liquid rocket engine, {{there has been a}} need to predict the peak heat ﬂux that affects the engine material and thus to control the wall thermal behavior of rocket engine. To prevent thermal failure, the engine is generally cooled by means of a coolant that ﬂows in passages that line the hottest part of the engine (i. e., combustion chamber and nozzle wall). This is the ﬂuid-cooling system. If the coolant is one of the propellants, once it passes through the cooling circuit, it can be injected into the combustion chamber or it can be dumped overboard. The former case is referred to as Regenerative cooling system while the latter as dump cooling system. In case of high performance cryogenic rocket engine (such as LO 2 /hydrogen and LO 2 /methane engines) the coolant working pressure is supercritical and thus it behaves far from a liquid or a perfect gas. The ﬂuid-cooling system (often referred to regenerative cooling because of the limited application of the dump cooling) of cryogenic rocket engines, is the technological background of this Ph. D. thesis. It is common and well conﬁrmed practice in industry to analyze wall thermal behavior of liquid rocket engine by means of simple and fast tools based on semi-empirical relationships. These relationships are generally calibrated by means of data collected in experimental tests of subscale engines. Industrial tools provide reasonable results but they are not able to accurately describe many phenomena that occur in the hot-wall/coolant environment, such as three-dimensional effects, asymmetric heat ﬂux distribution in the material and supercritical behavior of the coolant. For that reason, to circumvent the uncertainties of the design tools, regenerative systems are often over dimensioned. Moreover, these tools are deeply related to the engine for which they have been calibrated and thus they cannot be easily extended {{for a new generation of}} engines. In last years new approaches have risen; in fact new geometry conﬁguration (i. e., high aspect ratio cooling channels) and new coolants (such as methane) to be used in the next future, have imposed more accurate analysis tools, such as three-dimensional Navier Stokes solver to describe coolant ﬂow and three-dimensional Fourier analysis to describe wall thermal transmission. Simpliﬁed approaches are always used since, due to the limited computer power, three-dimensional tools are not suitable as design tools. However, accurate three-dimensional analysis can be integrated with simple and fast design tool in order to better describe and comprehend the phenomena that occur in the hot-wall/coolant environment. The aim of this study is to present and provide suitable theoretical and numerical tools able to describe the thermal behaviour that occur in regenerative cooling system, with special regard to the subcritical/supercritical coolant ﬂow inside cooling channels. This aim has been achieved in three steps: • A suitable mathematical description of thermophysical properties of coolants has been adopted. According to this mathematical modeling, computer subroutines describing the thermophysics of typical coolants (such as hydrogen and methane) have been implemented; • A suitable physical and mathematical model able to describe both the wall thermal behaviour and the coolant ﬂow that occur in regeneratively cooled rocket engines has been developed and implemented in a numerical code. The model is an extension of the typical 1 D-model in the sense that it is able to describe the coolant and ﬁn thermal stratiﬁcation that occurs in high aspect ratio cooling channels. For that reason this model will be referred to as a quasi- 2 D model. The coolant thermo-physical properties have been provided by means of the above mentioned hydrogen-methane subroutines. The code has been successfully validated with respect to the literature data; • At last, a Navier Stokes solver able to describe the high Reynolds num- ber turbulent ﬂow of generic ﬂuid in <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>cooling</b> channels has been developed. This numerical tool has been successfully validated by comparison with exact solutions and literature data. Furthermore three-dimensional ﬂow ﬁelds for a cryogenic ﬂuid (methane) have been computed to analyze the coolant behavior inside straight channels with rectangular cross section and to discuss the channel aspect ratio effect on the cooling performances...|$|E

We have considered intermittent winds induced by SNe explosions within super star clusters randomly distributed in the central region of the galaxy {{and were able to}} reproduce the observed M 82 wind conditions with its complex morphological outflow structure. We have found that the environmental conditions in the disk in nearly recent past are crucial to determine whether the wind will develop a large scale rich filamentary structure, as in M 82 wind, or not. Also, the numerical evolution of the SN ejecta have allowed us to obtain the abundance distribution over the first 3 kpc extension of the wind and we have found that the SNe explosions change significantly the metallicity only of the hot, low-density wind component. Moreover, we have found that the SN-driven wind transports to outside the disk large amounts of energy, momentum and gas, but the more massive high-density component reaches only intermediate altitudes smaller than 1. 5 kpc. Therefore, no significant amounts of gas mass are lost to the IGM and the mass evolution of the galaxy is not much affected by the starburst events occurring in the nuclear region.

40|$|The atom-by-atom {{characterization}} of quantum gases requires {{the development of}} novel measurement techniques. One particularly promising new technique demonstrated in recent experiments uses strong fluorescent laser scattering from neutral atoms confined in a short-period optical lattice to measure the position of individual atoms in the sample. A crucial condition for the measurements is that atomic hopping between lattice sites must be strongly suppressed despite substantial photon recoil heating. This article models <b>three-dimensional</b> polarization gradient <b>cooling</b> of atoms trapped within a far-detuned optical lattice. The atomic dynamics are simulated using a hybrid Monte Carlo and master equation analysis in order to predict the frequency of processes which give rise to degradation or loss of the fluorescent signal during measurements. It is shown, consistent with the experimental results, that there exists a wide parameter range in which the lifetime of strongly-fluorescing isolated lattice-trapped atoms is limited by background gas collisions rather than radiative processes.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the differences between}} two-dimensional models and <b>three-dimensional</b> models of <b>cooling</b> channel layout designs in a plastic injection molding die. To identify the differences, two kinds of three-dimensional numerical models are designed by the design method of cooling channel layout proposed in our previous research. The results show that, when the cooling channel layout is required so as to rapidly cool down and make temperature distribution of the plastic materials uniform, distinct cooling channel layouts are obtained because of different flow rates of coolant in the cooling channel between them. And also, it is shown that {{the distance between the}} cooling channel and cavity in the die is an effective factor to control the temperature distribution of plastic materials. From this result, the cooling channel layout design is implemented in two steps. At first, the distance between the cooling channel and the cavity is decided. The result of the first step is utilized as the initial design of the next step. In the second step, the length of cooling channel is designed. In addition, it is found that the surface area of cooling channel is important to control the temperature distribution of the plastic materials...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{considering}} {{the impact of}} a supernova remnant (SNR) with a neutral magnetized cloud we derived analytically a set of conditions that are favourable for driving gravitational instability in the cloud and thus star formation. Using these conditions, we have built diagrams of the SNR radius, R(SNR), versus the initial cloud density, n(c), that constrain a domain in the parameter space where star formation is allowed. This work is an extension to previous study performed without considering magnetic fields (Melioli et al. 2006, hereafter Paper I). The diagrams are also tested with fully <b>three-dimensional</b> MHD radiative <b>cooling</b> simulations involving a SNR and a self-gravitating cloud and we find that the numerical analysis is consistent with the results predicted by the diagrams. While the inclusion of a homogeneous magnetic field approximately perpendicular to the impact velocity of the SNR with an intensity similar to 1 mu G within the cloud results only a small shrinking of the star formation zone in the diagram relative to that without magnetic field, a larger magnetic field (similar to 10 mu G) causes a significant shrinking, as expected. Though derived from simple analytical considerations these diagrams provide a useful tool for identifying sites where star formation could be triggered by {{the impact of a}} supernova blast wave. Applications of them to a few regions of our own Galaxy (e. g. the large CO shell in the direction of Cassiopeia, and the Edge Cloud 2 {{in the direction of the}} Scorpious constellation) have revealed that star formation in those sites could have been triggered by shock waves from SNRs for specific values of the initial neutral cloud density and the SNR radius. Finally, we have evaluated the effective star formation efficiency for this sort of interaction and found that it is generally smaller than the observed values in our own Galaxy (SFE similar to 0. 01 - 0. 3). This result is consistent with previous work in the literature and also suggests that the mechanism presently investigated, though very powerful to drive structure formation, supersonic turbulence and eventually, local star formation, does not seem to be sufficient to drive global star formation in normal star-forming galaxies, not even when the magnetic field in the neutral clouds is neglected.
