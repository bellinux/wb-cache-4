5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Caernarfon's {{design and}} defences have been {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by the growth of the bastides. The bastides were new planned towns created in both France and English-held Gascony during the period, characterised by grids of straight streets, often defended by combinations of castles and town walls. More recent research, however, has shown that English town design played a more significant role in shaping Caernarfon and other Edwardian town plans. In the case of Caernarfon, the <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> and walls were adapted to fit around the site of the former Norman castle on the site, which lay just outside the new town and was used a market place.|$|E

Jones and his team had set out from Scarborough to the eastern boundary of the Nassau District, the approximate area of {{the mouth of the}} Trent River. From there, they began surveying townships along Lake Ontario travelling westwards. They surveyed in turn Murray Township, then Cramahe Township, Haldimand Township, Hamilton Township, Hope Township, Clarke Township, Darlington Township, Pickering Township, Glasgow Township, York Township and Etobicoke Township. Sideroads were then run north to the first concession road. Clarke township had previously been unnamed, Jones was the one to name it. The survey of the west end of the Nassau district finalised the boundary of the Toronto Purchase, which had been agreed upon in principle, but could not be completed because the land areas involved were not well known. On June 13, 1792 Jones submitted a <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> for Newark, Upper Canada to the Land Board.|$|E
5|$|In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo {{entered the}} service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a {{military}} architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron.

Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E
