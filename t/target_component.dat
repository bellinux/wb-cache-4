We define a target class {{as a set of}} contiguous target-sensor orientations over which the associated image is relatively invariant, or statistically stationary. Given an image from an unknown target, the objective is proper target-class association (target identity and pose). Our principal contribution is an image classifier in which a distinct set of templates is designed for each image class, with templates linked to the object sub-components, and the associated statistics are characterized via a hidden Markov model. In particular, we employ expansion matching (EXM) filters to identify the presence of the <b>target</b> <b>components</b> in the image, and use a hidden Markov tree (HMT) to characterize the statistics of the correlation of the image with the various templates. We achieve a successful classification rate of 92 % on a data set of FLIR vehicle images, compared with 72 % for a previously developed wavelet-feature-based HMT technique...|$|R

If a target name is {{included}} in the intent (explicit intent), Android system passes on the intent to the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> Inter-component communication using explicit intent is straight forward and is not included in this work. To address a component using an intent without the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> name (implicit intent), a general action is declared and the target is resolved by the Android system (runtime). The type of action in implicit intent, to be performed by a component, enables the system to find a set of appropriate components for that action. Finding the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> for an implicit intent is complicated: the system takes the intent’s data and looks for an appropriate set of components in the applications available on the mobile device. In case only one appropriate component is found, the system start that component, however, for more options, the system asks the user using a dialogue to choose from the list.|$|E
40|$|A typical {{situation}} in preparative chromatography {{is that a}} certain <b>target</b> <b>component</b> elutes {{somewhere in the middle}} of a train of other components present in the feed. In order to isolate efficiently this <b>target</b> <b>component</b> the operating conditions of conventional batch chromatography have to be optimized carefully. Nevertheless, the achievable production rates and recovery yields are frequently low. Recently a possible alternative was suggested [1] based on using batch chromatography just as a first step providing fractions where the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> has the highest or lowest retention time. Subsequently, these fractions could be processed using continuous countercurrent chromatography in order to isolate the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> Such a coupled process is analyzed theoretically for the case of linear adsorption isotherms. Based on results of simulations using a) the ideal model of chromatography and b) the equilibrium dispersive model it is demonstrated that the coupled process arrangement could possess advantages, compared to the application of batch chromatography alone.

40|$|The {{continuous}} simulated {{moving bed}} technology is increasingly {{applied for the}} production of value-added products. It offers the advantages of high throughput and low solvent consumption. However, the conventional SMB-technology is only suitable for the separation of binary mixtures. For the isolation of a certain <b>target</b> <b>component</b> out of multi-component mixture, it is typically necessary to apply conventional batch chromatography. A disadvantage of batch chromatography is the limited productivity due to low loading factors. In the contribution a combination of batch chromatography and subsequent continuous countercurrent chromatography is investigated theoretically. The procedure considered can be divided into two steps. At first, the sample is injected on a batch column. Applying appropriate collecting strategies, fractions can be taken in which the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> is located in the first or last position of the elution order. Subsequently, the fractions obtained using batch chromatography are fed to a continuous countercurrent unit for isolating the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> in one of the two effluent streams.

The separation process in the batch column is quantified using conventional models such as the equilibrium dispersive model. For the ease of discussion, ideal and linear case is considered in the simulation of continuous countercurrent chromatography. The analysis and the design of the combined process is discussed by investigating the separation of an intermediate component from a ternary mixture. Concepts to determine optimal operating points and to maximize the productivity are presented. It is shown that the combined technique has the potential to offer several advantages compared to batch chromatography alone. The important impact of the parameters of the adsorption isotherms on the performance of the combined process is demonstrated based on the results of parametric calculations...|$|E

Overall contrast effects occurred independently of these sequential effects, but were inconsistent across subjects.

For the isolation of a certain <b>target</b> <b>component</b> out of complex multi-component mixture, it is typically necessary to apply conventional batch chromatography. A disadvantage of batch chromatography is the limited productivity due to the low loading factors applicable. In this respect, the continuous simulated moving bed technology is an alternative method due to the advantages of high throughputs and low eluent consumptions. However, the conventional SMB-technology is only suitable for the separation of binary mixtures. In the contribution a combination of batch chromatography and subsequent continuous countercurrent chromatography is investigated theoretically.

Applying appropriate collecting strategies, fractions can be taken in which the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> is located in the first or last position of the elution order.

Both linear and nonlinear isotherms are considered in extensive simulations. The design of the combined process is discussed based on the example of investigating the separation of an intermediate component in the mixture. Several optimization algorithms (e. g. a random search method) are applied to determine optimal operating points based on different objective functions (e. g. productivity, eluent consumption). The convergence behaviour and the results obtained by different algorithms are compared. It is shown that the studied combined technique has under certain conditions the potential of increasing productivity and reducing eluent consumption in practical separations compared to batch chromatography alone...|$|E

40|$|The {{strong market}} demand for mobile {{applications}} such as iPhone makes value on the form factor of the mobile devices. The form factor means how much we can integrate many functions in a given size of the mobile devices. The external component size is almost comparable to a chip size so that elimination of external component {{is crucial to the}} success of mobile devices in addition to the cost issues of the external components. External reference resistors are often used as the standard for calibrating voltage sources, current sources, and other component values within a circuit. Often these calibrations occur at a factory, but may also occur on an electronic device as it is used. However, external reference resistors consume area and cost and it is desirable to eliminate them. This work introduces a new way to calibrate on-chip resistance and capacitance without the external reference resistors. An integrated circuit includes a benchmarking circuitry and a tunable circuitry. The benchmarking circuit includes a <b>target</b> <b>component</b> and an internal reference component. The internal reference component exhibits a lower sensitivity to the changes in test conditions than the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> Benchmarking Metric Measurement Module (BMMM) measures benchmarking metrics for the internal reference component and the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> A benchmark value is calculated based on the benchmarking metrics. The novelty of this work is the powerful way to cancel the parasitic and systemic errors caused by operational amplifiers in RC tuner circuitry. This technique is broadly applicable to any RF and analog circuits that need the calibration of tunable circuit elements without external references...|$|E
