He has published hundreds of books and articles, including Sichot Ha-Rav Tzvi Yehudah (talks by Ha-Rav Tzvi Yehudah), Tal Hermon on the weekly Torah portion and holidays, and his multi-volume responsa Shu"t She'eilat Shlomo. His talks and responsa appear monthly in the Yeshiva's journal, Iturei Cohanim. While his opinions are frequently printed in Israeli newspapers, Rav Aviner also contributes weekly to four parashah sheets, [...] "Ma'aynei Ha-Yeshu'ah", [...] "Be-Ahavah U-Be-Emunah" [...] of Machon Meir, [...] "Rosh Yehudi", and [...] "Olam Katan", which are distributed every Shabbat in shuls throughout Israel. He hosts two weekly radio programs, has a video blog (www.video.maale.org.il), teaches weekly classes, and gives talks in many different venues. The yeshiva also sends out weekly teachings of Rav Aviner in Hebrew, English, French, and Spanish, and has an English blog which is updated {{on a daily basis}} (www.ravaviner.com).

40|$|People {{have long}} been {{able to carry out}} some forms of {{collaborative}} intellectual work over great distances. Messages and manuscripts have been exchanged by post for centuries, facilitating at least loose forms of collaboration. At the end of the 19 th century it became possible to conduct synchronous interactions over distance with the appearance of the telephone. Throughout the 20 th century a cornucopia of new communications technologies widened the options for interacting at a distance. Today we routinely use <b>telephone,</b> <b>fax,</b> <b>e-mail,</b> audio and videoconferences, instant messaging, and an everwidening array of collaborative technologies on the Internet to coordinate and carry out our intellectual collaborations and social interactions. Throughout history, however, face-to-face interactions have been highly valued. In ancient times, people would endure long, slow trips in order to conduct face-to-face discussions. Thus, the emergence of modern transport networks has also had substantial impact on collaboration.

40|$|Banner {{blindness}} and information overload are {{studied in the}} field of human-computer interaction because they bring up a contradiction with the long-believed theory that in order to make something visually salient it should be different, sometimes significantly, from it’s surroundings. Banner Blindness research is beginning to prove that users overlook, or worse, ignore the most obvious links. This affects designers because they are taught to design for the most important item to be noticed first. On the web, as we will see, designing by these guidelines will cause a company to lose potential customers, and revenue.

The sixth offering of the course was presented during the summer 1996 term. As part of the course, a Mentors program was initiated as a means of providing the students with unique learning experiences. Six top-level transportation professionals from private enterprise and departments of transportation, who are leaders in their field and who have extensive experience with Intelligent Transportation Systems, were invited to Texas A&M University to present a 1 -day Symposium on Advanced Surface Transportation Systems {{at the beginning of the}} summer term. Immediately following the Symposium, the students enrolled in the course participated in a Forum and a Workshop with the transportation professionals and course instructor. Based on mutual interests, each student was assigned to one of the professionals who served as a mentor (along with the course instructor) for the remainder of the summer term. Each student worked with his/her mentor and course instructor to identify a topic area and objectives for a term paper.

The Birbrower court held that a New York law firm, none of whose attorneys were admitted to practice law in California, committed the unauthorized practice of law by advising a California corporation in an impending California arbitration.

Many health care workers {{managing}} HIV infected patients, particularly those in rural areas and primary care health facilities, have minimal access to information resources and to advice and support from experienced clinicians. The Medicines Information Centre, based in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Cape Town, has been running the National HIV Health Care Worker (HCW) Hotline since 2008, providing free information for HIV treatment-related queries via <b>telephone,</b> <b>fax</b> and <b>e-mail.</b> Results A questionnaire-based study showed that 224 (44 %) of the 511 calls that were received by the hotline during the 2 -month study period were patient-specific. Ninety-four completed questionnaires {{were included in the}} analysis. Of these, 72 (77 %) were from doctors, 13 (14 %) from pharmacists and 9 (10 %) from nurses. 96 % of the callers surveyed took an action based on the advice received from the National HIV HCW Hotline. The majority of actions concerned the start, dose adaption, change, or discontinuation of medicines. Less frequent actions taken were adherence and lifestyle counselling, further investigations, referring or admission of patients. Conclusions The information provided by the National HIV HCW Hotline on patient-specific requests has a direct impact on the management of patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. Tobacco {{reduction}} {{is a major}} priority in Canadian Inuit communities. However, many Inuit frontline health workers lacked the knowledge, confidence and support to address the tobacco epidemic. Given vast distances, high costs of face-to-face training and previous successful pilots using distance education, this method was chosen for a national tobacco reduction course. Objective. To provide distance education about tobacco reduction to at least 25 frontline health workers from all Inuit regions of Canada. Design. Promising practices globally were assessed in a literature survey. The National Inuit Tobacco Task Group guided the project. Participants were selected from across Inuit Nunangat. They chose a focus from a &#x 201 C;menu&#x 201 D; of 6 course options, completed a pre-test to assess individual learning needs and chose which community project(s) to complete. Course materials were mailed, and trainers provided intensive, individualized support through <b>telephone,</b> <b>fax</b> and <b>e-mail.</b> The course ended with an open-book post-test. Follow-up support continued for several months post-training. Results. Of the 30 participants, 27 (90 %) completed the course. The mean pre-test score was 72 % (range: 38 &#x 2013; 98 %). As the post-test was done using open books, everyone scored 100 %, with a mean improvement of 28 % (range: 2 &#x 2013; 62 %). Conclusions. Although it was often challenging to contact participants through phone, a distance education approach was very practical in a northern context. Learning is more concrete when it happens in a real-life context. As long as adequate support is provided, we recommend individualized distance education to others working in circumpolar regions...|$|R
