40|$|Transition of the {{attachment}} fine boundary layer was investigated using a large swept cylinder. Results for natural transition and transition tripping with two-dimensional trip wires were simila to those obtained by Poll using a similar, but smaller, model. ]Lower displacement thickness Reynolds numbers but larger trip sizes, {{than for the}} flat-plate boundary layer, were required for transition. The investigation of transition tripping was then extended to involve three-dimensional trips. The attachment line boundary layer was less susceptible to three-dimensional trips than to two-dimensional trips but {{upper and lower bounds}} of attachment line Reynolds number for transition were identical. It was also found that the roughness Reynolds numbers for fully effective three-dimensional trips were similar for {{the attachment}} line and flat-plate boundary layers. Another common feature was the more abrupt upstream movement of the transition front with increasing Reynolds number for three-dimensional trips than for two-dimensional trips. Turbulence spreading downstream of a three-dimensional trip was also examined and, as in the flat-plate boundary layer, was found to be heavily dependent on Reynolds number (varying from 3 * at low Reynolds number to a value approaching 10 * as Reynolds number exceeded the value for natural transition), but was also dependent on either the trip size or the initial conditions at which the trip first introduced turbulent spots. The effects of higher levels of freestrearn turbulence were then investigated for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional trips. With a small increase in freestrea turbulence the conditions for transition with twodimensional trips were affected far more than those for three-dimensional trips, for which only the transition completion conditions were affected signfficantly, resulting in a reduced extent ofthe transition region. Larger levels of turbulence appeared to have similar effects on the two trip types. Restrictions in model length and windspeed for the higher turbulence tests prevented an accurate investigation of the effects of turbulence,on the upper and lower bounds for transition tripping and on the influence of spanwise distance at higher levels of turbulence. Finally, the interaction between two <b>trips</b> <b>positioned</b> on the attachment line was examined. The effect of the second trip on the transition Reynolds number was found to a function of the streamwise separation distance between the two trips...|$|R

40|$|The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis is {{equipped}} with sophisticated navigational skills for returning to its nest after foraging [1, 2]. The ant's primary means for long-distance navigation is path integration, which provides a continuous readout of the ant's approximate distance [3] and direction [4] from the nest [5]. The nest is pinpointed {{with the aid of}} visual [6 – 8] and olfactory landmarks [9 – 11]. Similar landmark cues help ants locate familiar food sites. Ants on their outward <b>trip</b> will <b>position</b> themselves so that they can move upwind using odor cues to find food [12]. Here we show that homing ants also move upwind along nest-derived odor plumes to approach their nest. The ants only respond to odor plumes if the state of their path integrator tells them that they are near the nest. This influence of path integration is important because we could experimentally provoke ants to follow odor plumes from a foreign, conspecific nest and enter that nest. We identified CO 2 as one nest-plume component that can by itself induce plume following in homing ants. Taken together, the results suggest that path-integration information enables ants to avoid entering the wrong nest, where they would inevitably be killed by resident ants...|$|R

A significant amount of research has been stipulated by data recorded from lending and returning bicycles at geographically diverse stations. In this contribution, focus will be laid on the relationship that the bike-sharing system of the City of Vienna (CityBike Wien – CBW) has with its well developed public transport system. Does bike-sharing serve as competitor, relief or supplement? By surveying the total CBW trip data of 2015 – about 1 million records – we approach to answer this question.

Ethernet was used for all sampled value measurements, circuit breaker <b>tripping,</b> transformer tap-changer <b>position</b> reports and Precision Time Protocol synchronization of sampled value merging unit sampling. Test results showed that the protection relay under investigation operated correctly with process bus network traffic approaching 100 % capacity. The protection system was not adversely affected by synchronizing errors significantly larger than the standards permit, suggesting these requirements may be overly conservative. This 'closed loop' approach, using substation automation hardware, validated the operation of protection relays under extreme conditions.

40|$|Road safety {{continues}} to be an important issue with road crashes among the leading causes of death. Considerable effort has been put into improving our understanding of the factors that influence driving behaviour with a view to devising more effective road safety strategies. Within the literature, demographics, social norms, personality, enforcement and the road environment have all been identified as influencers of risky driving behaviour. What is missing is an integrated empirical approach which examines the relationship between these factors and drivers’ awareness of their speeding behaviour to a measure of day-to-day driving behaviour. This research employs demographic, psychological, vehicle, <b>trip</b> and Global <b>Positioning</b> System (GPS) driving data collected from 106 drivers in Sydney, Australia during a pay-as-you-drive study. The main contributions are three-fold. First, a methodology is developed to control for the influence of spatiotemporal characteristics on driver behaviour. This deals with the inherent variability introduced from road environment factors external to the driver which would otherwise lead to misleading results. Second, the creation of a composite measure of driver behaviour allows driver behaviour to be described using a single measure whilst accounting for the variability and multitude of aspects within the driving task. This allows drivers to be compared to each other and for the same driver to be compared across time and space permitting empirical testing of interventions in a before and after study. Lastly, this research reveals the potential for reducing the extent and magnitude of risky driving behaviour by making drivers aware of their own behaviour. The results indicate that drivers can be placed in three groups: drivers requiring a monetary incentive to change speeding behaviour, drivers requiring information alone to change their speeding behaviour and drivers that appear unresponsive to both monetary incentives and information...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{placement}} of reclosers on overhead lines {{in a medium}} voltage distribution network is known to improve the reliability of a power system. Traditionally, recloser placement studies have not considered the effect of greater numbers of reclosers on network damage during faults or the effect of positioning on protection settings. Recloser positions that enhance {{the reliability of the}} system may not necessarily improve other problematic operational aspects, such as the damage to equipment and the risk of incorrect tripping due to the sudden increase in loading. This research seeks to prove the hypothesis that: Recloser placement studies with the additional consideration of protection-related factors such as equipment damage and the risk of false tripping will result in different recloser positions compared to when the priority is only on improving reliability indices and cost. A tool is developed to assess the reliability indices, cost, damage and the risk of false tripping and it determines the best recloser positioning based on the priority given to each factor considered. Using this tool, observations are made on the effect of the added factors of damage and the risk of false <b>tripping</b> on recloser <b>positioning.</b> The addition of the protection-related factors to the objective function is unique in its ability to realise the value of recloser positions that cater for minimizing the damage factor and the possibility of tripping on load. In the absence of these factors, the value of certain recloser positions would not be identified as they would not improve reliability or cost factors. The importance of reliability and cost are not overruled by the addition of the protection-related factors. The consideration of protection-related factors in the planning process of optimising recloser placement ensures that the protection of the overhead line is optimal and is not compromised in any way. This would inherently {{have a positive effect on}} the lifespan of the equipment on the feeder and the reliability of the feeder in the long-term.

40|$|The newly {{proposed}} {{approach to}} the calculation of bulk service contributions in Gauteng uses not only trip generation, but also Vehicle-Kilometres of Travel (VKT) generated by a development {{as the basis for}} estimating traffic impact. This presents an empirical problem as data on VKT or trip lengths, linked to specific types and sizes of developments, are scarce and difficult to measure. Previous approaches to measuring trip lengths have used travel surveys with and without Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data. South Africa has relied only on travel surveys without GPS data to estimate trip length information. The recommended trip length information for different developments in South Africa is provided in the TMH 17 document which is used in the bulk service contributions calculations. However, the trip lengths provided in the TMH 17 is based on limited South African data and is supplemented by studies that were done in Florida in the United States of America. The advances made in GPS technology over the last decade have created new opportunities {{that can be used to}} collect GPS data for travel surveys. In this research a novel approach to collecting and analysing trip length data using passive GPS loggers distributed to a sample of 726 drivers in Gauteng was tested. A stop time of 110 seconds and repeated use of road links were used to detect trip ends in the GPS data set. The shopping centre trips were extracted using Geographic Information System (GIS) data of the locations of shopping centres compared to the <b>trip</b> end <b>positions.</b> The average <b>trip</b> lengths to and from shopping centre were then calculated. It was found that the average trip length per shopping centre size is longer by approximately 4. 8 km compared to the prescribed TMH 17 average trip lengths. These results need to be confirmed with further research. The GPS data also provided the opportunity to calculate the percentage of travel per road Class to and from shopping centres. This is important, owing to the bulk contributions calculations only using the half adjusted average trip length. This is the average trip length halved and then only using the distance travelled on roads under the jurisdiction of the municipality excluding travel on Class 4 and Class 5 roads. It was found that 43 % of the trip length distance is travelled on Class 2 and Class 3 roads. The 43 % was compared to the TMH 17 method of reducing the half average trip length to estimate the halve adjusted average trip length. The 43 % was found to give similar results than the TMH 17 method. Owing to the significant difference in average trip lengths between TMH 17 and the GPS data results an alternative method of estimating average trip lengths was proposed. It was proposed that average trip lengths be estimated based on shopping centre type and not Gross Leasable Area (GLA). It was also proposed that the 43 % reducing factor be used instead of the TMH 17 method of estimating the halve adjusted average trip length as the 43 % reducing factor is far less complicated. The proposed alternative method is subjected to further research and confirming of the average trip lengths results.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis show an experimental study about {{the enhancement of}} energy conversion efficiency of a vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) based energy generation system. Firstly, there is {{a discussion about the}} recent scenario of energy demand on the world and the necessity of development of renewable energy generation systems {{in order to reduce the}} CO 2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels and also reduce the dependency of this kind of fuel because it is a limited source of power. The generation system used in this study is constituted by a cylinder, which oscillates when submitted to a constant fluid flow, and a leverage system, responsible to transmit the translational motion of the cylinder to the translational motion of a magnetic bar inside a coil, generating electricity. This generation system was already tested previously to this work and achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of 4. 5 %. To enhance the system efficiency a pair of tripping rods were attached to the cylinder symmetrically positioned in relation to the stagnation point. Tripping rods also are cylinder, but with much small diameters than the main cylinder. Their attachment changes the flow pattern around the cylinder and can produce since reduction to increase of hydrodynamic forces and amplitude of VIV, according to their angular positions. The experiments were divided in three cases, starting from the simplest case and adding complexity. The first experiments consisted of a stationary cylinder submitted to a constant flow and was carried out to measure the drag and lift forces acting on the cylinder in function oftripping rods angular position, which varied from 15 o to 165 o, with a 7. 5 o interval. The second set of experiments was conducted with a free-oscillating cylinder without energy generation system. This system had small mass and damping ratios, 6. 13 and 0. 016 respectively. <b>Tripping</b> rods were <b>positioned</b> at 60 o, 75 o, 105 o and 120 o in order to observe the changes on VIV amplitude imposed by their presence. The third and last set of experiments consisted of free-oscillating cylinder with the generating system attached. This experimental setup had larger mass and damping ratios due de inclusion of the generating system, achieving a mass ratio of 12. 34 and an average damping ratio of 0. 048. The stationary cylinder experiments were carried out at constant Reynolds number of 7. 48 × 103. It was observed during these experiments that when placing tripping rods at angular positions ranging from 22. 5 o to 52. 5 o and from 97. 5 o to 165 o a reduction of the forces acting on the cylinder occurred, achieving a maximum reduction of 67 % on lift and 20 % on drag forces. An increase on lift and drag forces was observed when placing tripping rods between 52. 5 o and 90 o, achieving a maximum increase of 68 % on lift and 40 % on drag forces. On free-oscillating tests without generator, Reynolds number varied from 3. 45 × 103 to 2. 04 × 104 and the reduced velocity from 2 to 12. When <b>tripping</b> rods were <b>positioned</b> at 60 o and 75 o significant changes occurred, with an monotonically increase of oscillation amplitudes, starting at reduced velocity 7 and continuing until 12, with a maximum amplitude 56 % larger than the obtained with the smooth cylinder. When tripping rods were placed behind the cylinder, at 105 o and 120 o, the opposite occurred, and the amplitudes were reduced significantly, achieving an almost complete VIV suppression at 120 o. Finally, the free-oscillating experiments with the generator showed that even with larger mass and damping ratios the presence of tripping rods can bring lots of benefits for energy generation using VIV, especially when they were placed at 75 o. The system efficiency during smooth cylinder tests achieved a maximum of 2. 8 %, while the efficiency with tripping rods at 75 o achieved a maximum of 12. 47 %, representing a 342 % increase. But the increase on efficiency was not the only benefit brought by tripping rods. Their presence also increased the lock-in range and maintained the power generation almost constant at reduced velocities between 6. 5 and 8. 5, meaning that the system can maintain the generation even with flow speed variations inside this range. The results showed up that the attachment of tripping rods have a great potential on the improvement of energy harvesting using VIV phenomena. This research covered only a small number of combinations of mass ratio, damping ratio, Reynolds number and diameter of tripping rods in relation to the diameter the main cylinder. It means that further research can be made as an extension of the current work, opening the opportunity for other researchers to investigate manners of increase even more the efficiency of energy conversion. この博士論文は、渦励振を利用した発電システムのエネルギー変換効率を向上させるための実験的研究について記したものである。最初に、世界におけるエネルギー需要に関する最近の動向、および再生可能エネルギー技術を開発することの必要性について述べる。この必要性は、化石燃料消費に伴う二酸化炭素排出量の削減のため、および、賦存量が限られている資源への依存性を削減するためという目的に起因している。 本研究で用いる発電システムは一本の円柱を有する。この円柱は流れの中に置かれた時に振動する。また、本システムはてこ機構を含み、この機構は円柱の並進運動を、コイル内部における磁石の並進運動に伝達させる役割をもつ。この磁石の運動により電力を発生させる。この発電システムを用いた発電試験は過去に行われており、その際のエネルギー変換効率は最大で 4. 5 ％であった。 発電効率を向上させるために本研究では、小直径の円柱（トリッピングロッド）を２つ、前方よどみ点に関して対称に円柱表面に付加することを試みた。この付加により円柱表面付近における流れを変化させ、円柱に作用する流体力、渦励振の振幅を増大させる効果を期待できる。円柱中心と前方よどみ点とを結ぶ線分と、円柱中心とトリッピングロッド取り付け位置とを結ぶ線分とがなす角度（以下、取り付け角度）によって、この効果に大小が変化することが予想された。 三種類の実験を実施した。一つ目は、円柱を固定した状態で支持し、一定流速の流れの中に置き、円柱に作用する抗力と揚力の計測である。取り付け角度は 15 度から 165 度まで 7. 5 度刻みで変化させた。レイノルズ数は 7. 48 × 103 である。 二つ目は、円柱をばね支持し、発電機を外した状態での計測である。質量比は 6. 13 、減衰比は 0. 016 である。取り付け角度は 60 度、 75 度、 105 度、 120 度の 4 か所とした。レイノルズ数は 3. 45 × 103 から 2. 04 × 104 までの領域であり、この領域は換算流速 2 から 12 までの領域に相当する。 三つ目は、円柱をばね支持し、発電機を付けた状態での計測である。質量比は 12. 34 、減衰比は 0. 048 である。 一つ目の固定円柱試験の結果、取り付け角度が 22. 5 o から 52. 5 oまでの領域および 97. 5 o から 165 oまでの領域のとき、流体力が低下することが示された。トリッピングロッドの付加なしの場合に比べて揚力は最大で 67 ％、抗力は最大で 20 ％低下した。取り付け角度が 52. 5 o から 90 oまでの領域のとき、揚力、抗力ともに増加し、トリッピングロッドの付加なしの場合に比べて揚力は最大で 68 %、抗力は最大で 40 ％増加した。 二つ目の振動円柱試験（発電機なし）では、取り付け角度が 60 度および 75 度のとき、顕著な効果が検出された。換算流速が 7 以上になると振動振幅が単調に増加し、この傾向は換算流速 12 まで続いた。トリッピングロッドなしの場合に比べて振幅が最大で 56 ％増加した。一方で、トリッピングロッドを円柱後方に付加（取り付け角度 105 度、 120 度）したときは、振幅は大幅に減少し、 120 度の場合では振動はほぼ完全に消失した。三つ目の振動円柱試験（発電機あり）では、質量比と減衰比が比較的に大きいにもかかわらず、トリッピングロッドの付加は、エネルギー変換効率の向上をもたらすことが示された。このことは取り付け角度が 75 度の場合に特に顕著であった。付加なしの場合では、変換効率は 2. 8 ％に過ぎなかったのに対して、付加ありの場合では最大で 12. 47 %（ 3. 42 倍に相当）にまで高まった。また本実験により、トリッピングロッドの付加による効果には、変換効率を向上させるという点だけではなく、自励振動の同期領域を拡大させるという点もあることが見出された。付加ありの場合、換算流速 6. 5 から 8. 5 までの領域では、発生電力が一定に維持され、このことは流速がこの範囲内で変化しても発生電力が安定に保たれることを意味する。 以上の実験結果から、トリッピングロッドの付加は、渦励振を利用する発電システムのエネルギー変換効率を向上させる効果をもつことが示された。本研究では、質量比、減衰比、レイノルズ数、トリッピングロッドと振動円柱との直径比に関して数個の場合のみ実験を行った。これらのパラメーターをさらに変化させ、エネルギー変換の大小を調べることが次の課題として挙げられる...|$|R
