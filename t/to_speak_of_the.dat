5|$|King began <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{need for}} {{fundamental}} changes {{in the political and}} economic life of the nation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice.|$|E
5|$|Prominent First Nations people include Joe Capilano, who {{met with}} King of the United Kingdom, Edward VII, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to settle land claims and Ovide Mercredi, a leader at both the Meech Lake Accord {{constitutional}} reform discussions and Oka Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are {{the uniqueness of the}} identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E

5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264BC when {{inhabitants}} of Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay—Rome and Carthage—to resolve internal conflicts. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. Before the First Punic War there was no Roman navy <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the study}} of heat {{conduction}} is based on several principles. Heat flow {{is a form of}} energy flow, and as such it is meaningful <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time rate of flow of heat into a region of space.|$|E
40|$|Ancient Teutonic, {{a highly}} inflected language, {{probably}} had a future tense for its verbs. But the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes {{seem to have lost}} it by the time they invaded the British Isles in the fifth and sixth centuries.

25|$|It {{makes good}} sense, for example, to say of the {{extensive}} variable , or {{of the extensive}} variable , {{that it has a}} density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but {{it makes no sense to}} speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, it makes no sense <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|It is so {{overwhelmingly}} Republican that Democrats typically don't {{make a real}} {{effort as}} a party. A candidate puts himself up, but generally it's somebody who has no political strengths and gets no financial contributions or volunteer help <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> campaign gets little attention. And the prophecy gets fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment {{you listen to the}} sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} charge {{carriers}} are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron. The movement {{of any of}} these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional current without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving {{in the direction of the}} conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.|$|E
25|$|In addition, even if {{the claim}} of a {{homogenous}} celebration of the Byzantine Rite could be claimed for the modern period, this has historically not been the case. During the period of separation of the Eastern and Western Churches, {{it would have been}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Rite as being the only liturgy in use, even in the Eastern Church. The Rite of Constantinople only acquired dominance in the Eastern Church through a slow process that was not complete until at least the thirteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Fugate {{received}} {{a life sentence}} on November 21, 1958. She was paroled in June 1976 after serving 17 years at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women in York, Nebraska. She settled in Lansing, Michigan, where she changed her name {{and worked as a}} janitor at a Lansing hospital. Fugate married Frederick Clair in 2007 and, apart from a radio interview in 1996, has refused <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder spree. Caril Ann Clair was living in Stryker, Ohio when she was seriously injured and her husband killed in a car crash on August 5, 2013.|$|E

25|$|The changes {{brought about}} by these {{developments}} have led many scholars to view this period {{as the end of}} the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Middle Ages at all, but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.|$|E
25|$|In {{one extreme}} {{instance}} of self-censorship, the team explored an urban legend stating that a widely available material {{could be used}} to create an explosive. To their surprise, the seemingly unlikely legend proved true, but the material was so easy to obtain, and the resulting explosion so powerful, that the production team decided it would be irresponsible to allow such information to reach the general public, instead electing to destroy all footage of the experiment and agreeing never <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. Only several years later, when DARPA solicited advice from the public regarding potentially unknown bomb risks, did Savage contact them about their discovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, first Mark, {{and then}} Matthew and Luke, depict Jesus as {{presiding over the}} Last Supper. References to Jesus' body and blood foreshadow his crucifixion, and he identifies them as a new covenant. In the gospel of John, {{the account of the}} Last Supper has no mention of Jesus taking bread and wine and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of the unity of the disciples with him and each other.|$|E

25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{domestic}} violence toward women is considered as {{any type of}} abuse that {{can be considered a}} threat; it can also be physical, psychological, or sexual abuse to any current or former partner. Domestic violence is not handled as a crime or complaint, it is seen more as a private or family matter. In determining the category of a complaint, it is based on caste, class, religious bias and race which also determines whether action is to be taken or not. Many studies have reported about the prevalence of the violence and have taken a criminal-justice approach, but most woman refuse to report it. These women are guaranteed constitutional justice, dignity and equality but continue to refuse based on their sociocultural contexts. As the women refuse <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence and find help, they are also not receiving the proper treatment.|$|E
25|$|Ishmael digresses on {{pictures}} of whales, brit (microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed), squid and— after four boats lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid {{for the white}} whale— whale-lines. The next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the Pequods black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing {{at the head of}} the whale, Ahab begs it <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depths of the sea. The Pequod next encounters the Jeroboam, which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by an epidemic.|$|E
