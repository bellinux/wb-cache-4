He reiterated his desire to play for Manchester United if given a chance and added, [...] "For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a dream come true.

500|$|In January 2009, Matthew Zeghibe, a 26-year-old {{computer}} art {{student from}} Connecticut, used pitch-correction software {{to make a}} clip that he claimed was the soundboard recording of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] from Beyoncé's Today show appearance in November 2008. In the tape, Beyoncé sang drastically off-key. A corresponding video was leaked onto the internet, and it went viral. It was even played on American radio stations on April 21, 2009; Howard Stern played the recording, describing it as [...] "the unedited board mix" [...] of Beyoncé's live performance. According to Us Weekly, Mathew Knowles {{was the first to}} cast doubt on the recording's authenticity, saying that the tape seemed to have been altered. He added that [...] "at 12 years into Beyoncé's career, the last thing someone should be questioning is her vocal ability. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> questioning if Kobe Bryant could shoot a jump shot." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his work}} as an art {{director}} on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya (2007), Omung Kumar started writing two scripts simultaneously for his directorial debut. However, none of the films were made. He then asked writer Saiwyn Quadras {{to look for a}} female biographical subject for his first film, specifying [...] "a role that no actress would turn down." [...] He added that he [...] "wanted to make a film <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the Mother India of someone's career." [...] Historical personalities such as Rani Laxmi Bai and Queen Elizabeth I of England came up for discussion; however they did not inspire Kumar. Quadras put forward the name of five-time world boxing champion Mary Kom, who despite numerous achievements, was at that time an unfamiliar name in India. Kumar admitted that he felt disgusted after being told of Kom's achievements as he was unaware of her existence. After Quadras approached Kumar with the script for Mary Kom, Kumar decided to make his directorial debut with a film about Kom.|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery of MTV {{compared}} the album to Kid A {{because of the}} lack of guitars, the style of being completely different to the band's previous works, and the album's message. Montgomery said, [...] "None of these problems, these terrors or these specters that haunt us in 2010 are particularly new. Quite the opposite, in fact. We've just chosen to ignore the warnings. And now it might be too late." [...] According to turntablist Joe Hahn, the album's title is a reference to a line in the Hindu Sanskrit scripture the Bhagavad Gita [...] "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the splendor of the mighty one," [...] which was made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb. The title also appears in the album's lead single [...] "The Catalyst", which appears in the line [...] "God save us everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?". The band said Oppenheimer's comments about the nuclear bomb influenced the apocalyptic themes of the album. The band wrote about these comments in the album's liner notes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While in {{the process}} of {{creating}} Saint Seiya, Masami Kurumada initially gave Seiya the name Rin, intending to title his manga [...] However, as he continued developing the story, he changed the name to Seiya, which he felt was more fitting. First he used the name with the Japanese characters that mean , to relate it to Seiya's condition as a Saint, but later decided to spell it as [...] "star arrow", to emphasize the constellation and mythological motif. Finally, he changed the title of the manga to Saint Seiya, once the concept of the Saints was fully developed. Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he had for Saint Seiya was the [...] "Pegasus Meteor Fist". Since his manga was going to use the constellations as a very important and ever-present theme, he wanted his protagonist to have a special move <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a shower of meteors.|$|E

2500|$|Hitler {{had been}} {{considering}} {{war with the}} Soviet Union since July 1940. However, after Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, in October 1940, the Soviet Union explored a possible entry into the Axis themselves. Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate, where he negotiated with Ribbentrop and Hitler personally, who spoke at length about {{a division of the}} world after the destruction of Britain <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a gigantic world estate in bankruptcy". [...] After long discussions and proposals, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). Eleven days later, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counter-proposal where they would accept the four-power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence focus on the area around modern Iraq and Iran. The Soviets concurrently promised, by May 11, 1941, the delivery of 2.5 million tons of grain—1 million tons above its current obligations. [...] They also promised full compensation for the Volksdeutsche property claims. Germany never responded to the counter-proposal. [...] Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union.|$|E

60|$|There is a {{good deal}} of {{similarity}} about our ghostly experiences; but this of course is not our fault but the fault ghosts, who never will try any new performances, but always will keep steadily to old, safe business.
