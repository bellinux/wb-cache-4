5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI.

30|$|Taken all together, {{the results}} of this study show that the service {{innovation}} practice differs between Malaysia and Bangladesh. In Malaysia, organisational culture is revealed to be a strong predictor for operating core of service innovation compared to <b>the</b> Bangladeshi <b>telecommunications</b> sector. Furthermore, in <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>telecommunications</b> sector, competition-informed pricing does not necessitate playing any role between operating core of service innovation and performance, while in <b>the</b> Bangladeshi <b>telecommunications</b> sector, competition-informed pricing facilitates the relationship of tools or technology with performance. In addition, the relationship between tools or technology and competition-informed pricing is strong in <b>the</b> Bangladeshi <b>telecommunications</b> sector. On <b>the</b> other hand, it is not significant in <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>telecommunications</b> sector. It is however expected that if the respective managers of both countries consider these issues, it would contribute immensely towards the practice of service innovation management as a whole.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of <b>the</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942.

5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship agreement with <b>the</b> <b>telecommunications</b> company Telenor, where the latter would {{pay up to}} NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} of police officers have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E
