5|$|From 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud as {{a leader}} of the Oglala Lakota fought against US forces, attacking their forts in an effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control</b> of the Powder River Country of Montana. In support of him, Sitting Bull led {{numerous}} war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868. Sitting Bull also made guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control</b> her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control</b> over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control.</b> Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control.</b> Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|Phase IV: As Rome {{began to}} {{struggle}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control</b> over its sprawling territories, military service {{continued to be}} salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded {{to such an extent}} that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a trend in the late empire of an increasing predominance of cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>control</b> of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
