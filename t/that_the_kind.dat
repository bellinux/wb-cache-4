5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did}} not believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the first}} two years of Timesitheus's {{prefecture}} seems to have been spent producing a stable environment in which government of any sort could be carried on. His main weapon to this end seems to have been to strengthen the authority of the Praetorian Prefecture, his own office, and to move equestrians with a fiscal background - such as himself - into positions of power. The main effect of his manoeuvring seems to have been to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of men who had carried on the government under Alexander Severus were restored to effective office.|$|E
25|$|The {{parabolic}} arch {{has been associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the {{parabolic arch}} in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast in-situ concrete, the nave of the church was a free-standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E

25|$|The Corinthian {{capital is}} {{essentially}} round {{at the bottom}} where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom. This shape lent itself {{to a wide variety}} of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative, without forgetting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of stone used for construction of Romanesque churches in Portugal was mostly granite which made the carving of intricate and sharp details much harder.|$|E
25|$|The {{genesis of}} Zack and Miri {{has been in}} Kevin Smith's mind since the '90s. Two porn {{centered}} projects were in development. One was a film called Name. It {{was intended to be}} a follow up (not a sequel) to Chasing Amy and would've starred the trio from that movie, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Joey Lauren Adams and to be set in the View Askewniverse. But the project wasn't made, and was replaced with Dogma. The second attempt was in 1997 as a failed 22 episode series titled Hiatus. The series would've starred Lee again, and was about a man returning home after being away in California and leading a double life as a porn star. When he pitched the series to tv networks, they all rejected the idea believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of material handed to them can never happen on television. But he kept the idea in mind and wrote a script following Clerks II that would be porn-bent.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E

500|$|Planning for a [...] "Government village" [...] {{to house}} the workers at the Clinton Engineer Works began in June 1942. Because the site was remote, it was {{believed}} more convenient and secure for the workers {{to live on the}} site. The gentle slopes of Black Oak Ridge, from which the new town of Oak Ridge got its name, were selected as a suitable location. Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay, the deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Army Services of Supply, reminded Marshall of a wartime limit of $7,500 per capita for individual quarters, but Groves, Nichols and Marshall saw no prospect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of workers they needed would be willing to live in substandard accommodations. The first plan, submitted by Stone & Webster on 26 October 1942, was for a residential community of 13,000 people.|$|E
500|$|Dalrymple {{advances}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of sentimentality that {{he wishes}} {{to draw attention to}} is [...] "an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason" [...] and which is performed [...] "in full public view". Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into how we should react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
500|$|Steve Palopoli of Metro Silicon Valley said, [...] "Musically, {{the show}} is heavy on the hits, {{although}} considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts {{that seem to have}} been handed down in regards to the music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" [...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person who goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of quantum physics, some {{scientists}} believed the concept of matter had merely changed, while others believed the conventional position {{could no longer be}} maintained. For instance Werner Heisenberg said [...] "The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of existence, the direct 'actuality' of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible... atoms are not things." [...] Likewise, some philosophers feel that these dichotomies necessitate a switch from materialism to physicalism.

2500|$|Margarite Fernandez Olmos {{comments}} on the novel's pioneering position in the Chicano literary tradition: [...] "Bless Me, Ultima blazed a path within the Chicano literary tradition in the [...] novels of identity in which the main characters must redefine themselves within the larger society {{from the vantage point}} of their own distinct ethnicity." [...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position. In an interview with Margot Kelly, Chavez concludes, [...] "Anaya maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of protagonist who will be able to become free is a person of synthesis, a person who is able to draw [...] [...] [...]on our Spanish roots and our native indigenous roots and become a new person, become that Mestizo with a unique perspective." [...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.

2500|$|Rabbi Frimer's {{second and}} what he {{characterized}} as his most important objection was to R. [...] Sperber's argument that kevod hatzibur could be overridden by the principle of kevod habriyot. He strongly objected {{to the idea of}} kevod habriyot overriding a rabbinic decree in its entirety, [...] arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of embarrassment or shame that would make it possible to invoke kevod habriyot had to come from factors (such as excrement or nakedness) external to the decree that occurred only in limited circumstances. He argued that a rabbinic decree cannot itself be regarded as shameful or embarrassing. To permit a rabbinic prohibition to be characterized as an embarrassment, R. Frimer argued, would give anyone [...] "carte blanch" [...] to abrogate any Rabbinic prohibition simply by saying [...] "This offends me." [...] He said that [...] "Such a position is untenable, if not unthinkable." [...] Accordingly, he argued that [...] "kevod ha-beriyyot cannot be invoked to nullify a rabbinic commandment, where the shame comes from the very fulfillment of the rabbinic injunction itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} it is a myth that most {{patients}} who want to die choose euthanasia because they are in extreme pain. He said that in his own experience, [...] "those with pain are more likely than others to oppose physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia." [...] He said that patients were more likely to want euthanasia because of [...] "depression and general psychological distress ... a loss of control or of dignity, of being a burden, and of being dependent." [...] He also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of legalized euthanasia practiced in the Netherlands would lead to an ethical [...] "slippery slope" [...] which {{would make it easier for}} doctors to rationalize euthanasia when it would save them the trouble of cleaning bedpans and otherwise caring for patients who want to live. He said that legalized euthanasia in the Netherlands did not adhere to all the legal guidelines, and that some newborns were euthanised even though they could not possibly have given the legally required consent. As Emanuel said, [...] "The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. Indeed, the persistence of abuse and the violation of safeguards, despite publicity and condemnation, suggest that the feared consequences of legalization are exactly its inherent consequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|The more fulsome, cliche-ridden {{chapters}} in From Emperor To Citizen, dealing with Puyi's prison experiences, and written {{at the height}} of the Mao personality cult, give the impression of well-learned, regurgitated lessons. The style of them was de rigueur in 1964. Today, they have a faintly archaic air. These days, all Chinese historians recognize the appalling consequences of the [...] "Great Leap Forward", and deplore the repression that followed the [...] "Let a hundred flowers bloom" [...] movement. Neither is mentioned in Puyi's book, nor was it possible to begin doing so anywhere in China without risking arrest until the dark years of the Cultural Revolution and the 'Gang of Four' were over ... The younger generation of Chinese knows, even if their elders do not, that during those years vast areas of China become 'Potemkin villages' bearing no relationship with reality: Some of the farms and factories that Puyi visited during his final 'remoulding' years in prison may themselves have been 'Potemkin villages' ... but the after-effects of the Cultural Revolution are such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of prose Puyi used to describe his experiences will never be believed wholeheartedly by post-Cultural Revolution readers. This form of skepticism will last until the last trace of Mao-worship gives way to a frank, realistic assessment of him in light of his appalling [...] "Let a hundred flowers bloom" [...] repression, his half-baked [...] "Great Leap Forward", and the ruthless destruction of his own Party apparatus during the Cultural Revolution ... By rights, as Simon Leys in The Burning Forest has pointed out, the much vilified Gang of Four which brought such chaos and misery to China should be called the Gang of Five, for without Mao it would never have established itself as a ruling group in the first place. Puyi, however, belongs to the era when the cosy, narrow Maoist line was still unquestioned, and not yet brought into terminal disrepute by the Red Guards and the Gang of Four.|$|E
