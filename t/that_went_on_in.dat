500|$|The {{death in}} 1695 of Sir William Phips vacated the {{governorship}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. [...] Colonial agents lobbied to select either Wait Winthrop or Joseph Dudley, both native sons, to replace Phips, but the king, wanting {{someone who would}} better represent crown authority, selected Bellomont. Since William wanted someone who could exert authority over more of New England, he was also given the governorships of New Hampshire, and New York. The major concern that Bellomont was instructed to address was ongoing problems with piracy, including the open commerce with pirates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> New York City and Rhode Island.|$|E
500|$|According to Aguilera herself, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] {{talks about}} her abusive childhood. She revealed, [...] "I think going through what I went through {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> my {{household}} [...] did affect me a lot. Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, {{the principles of the}} Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} the Moscow Foundling Home, Catherine {{established}} the Smolny Institute for Noble Girls to educate females. The Smolny Institute {{was the first of}} its kind in Russia. At first, the Institute only admitted young girls of the noble elite, but eventually it began to admit girls of the petit-bourgeoisie, as well. The girls who attended the Smolny Institute, Smolyanki, were often accused of being ignorant of anything <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the world outside the walls of the Smolny buildings. Within the walls of the Institute, they were taught impeccable French, musicianship, dancing, and complete awe of the Monarch. At the Institute, enforcement of strict discipline was central to its philosophy. Running and games were forbidden, and the building was kept particularly cold because too much warmth was [...] believed to be harmful to the developing body, as was excess play.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{unsuccessful}} {{nature of}} the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006, Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi. Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname [...] "The Cooler" [...] among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves. According to Yankee manager Joe Torre's 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname [...] "A-Fraud" [...] from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands. [...] "It was [...] in front of him", Torre later said of the nickname. [...] "A lot of that stuff <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff", he explained.|$|E
2500|$|Hugh Lynn {{narrowed the}} mailing list to some 300 {{members who were}} {{genuinely}} enthusiastic, {{and as a result}} the first annual congress of the assoc was held in June 1932. [...] He procured speakers on various metaphysical and psychic subjects and included public readings by Cayce. [...] Members left the conference eager to start study groups in their own localities. [...] Records were kept of everything <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the readings including the attitudes and routines of Cayce. Everything was then checked with the subjects of the readings, most of whom were not present during the reading, and the data was published in a study entitled [...] "100 cases of clairvoyance." [...] However, the response from scientists in general was that none of the experiments were performed under test conditions. [...] Hugh Lynn continued to build files of case histories, parallel studies in psychic phenomena, and research readings for the study groups.|$|E
