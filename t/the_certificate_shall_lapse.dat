40|$|Abstract. Resource {{security}} {{pertains to}} the prevention of unauthorized usage of system resources that may not directly cause corruption or leakage of information. A common breach of resource security is the class of attacks called DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This paper proposes an architecture called TINMAN whose goal is to efficiently and effectively safeguard resource security for mobile source code written in C. We couple resource usage checks at the programming language level and at the run-time system level. This is achieved by the generation of a resource skeleton from source code. This resource skeleton abstracts the resource consumption behavior of the program which is validated {{by means of a}} resource usage certificate that is derived from proof generation. TIN-MAN uses resource-usage checking tools to generate proof obligations required of <b>the</b> resource usage <b>certificate</b> and provides full coverage by monitoringany essential property not guaranteed by <b>the</b> <b>certificates.</b> We <b>shall</b> describe <b>the</b> architecture of TINMAN and give some experimental results of the preliminary TINMAN implementation. ...|$|R

The control of information involved in the process allows to trace the production of matrices, providing an indication of the quality with which they were obtained. Each supplier gives different approach to issuing a document, calling it Certificate of Conformity Protocol Preparation, Manufacturing Certificate or Quality Certificate. Summarizing, it is a supplier's declaration, which involves the quality control of raw materials, packaging materials and of the process used, but not a report that enables customers to repeat the analysis.
