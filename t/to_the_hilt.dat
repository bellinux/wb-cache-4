5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt.</b> He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{into a long}} {{philosophical}} {{tradition of}} inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting {{the idea of a}} natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{the theory}} state that the Indian {{rebellion}} of 1857 {{may have played a}} role in reinforcing the British belief in it. During this event the troops from the Bengal Native Infantry led by sepoy Mangal Pandey mutinied against the British. However, the loyal Pashtuns, Punjabis, Gurkhas, Kumaoni/Kumaunis and Garhwalis did not join the mutiny, and fought on the side of the British Army. From then on, this theory was used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> to accelerate recruitment from among these 'races', whilst discouraging enlistment of 'disloyal' troops and high-caste Hindus who had sided with the rebel army during the war.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes a tassel is {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt.</b> During the Ming Dynasty these were usually passed through an openwork pommel, {{and in the}} Qing {{through a hole in}} the grip itself; modern swords usually attach the tassel to the end of the pommel. Historically these were likely used as lanyards, allowing the wielder to retain the sword in combat. There are some sword forms which utilize the tassel as an integral part of their swordsmanship style (sometimes offensively), while other schools dispense with sword tassels entirely. The movement of the tassel may have served to distract opponents, and some schools further claim that metal wires or thin silk cords were once worked into the tassels for impairing vision and causing bleeding when swept across the face. The tassel's use now is primarily decorative.|$|E
25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel {{before he}} even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball crashing to the fence. His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family cheered and backed Hayden up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E

5000|$|A typical talwar has a wider blade {{than the}} shamshir. Late {{examples}} often had European-made blades, set into distinctive Indian-made <b>hilts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> of <b>the</b> typical talwar is termed a [...] "disc hilt" [...] from the prominent disc-shaped flange surrounding the pommel. The pommel often has a short spike projecting from its centre, sometimes pierced for a cord <b>to</b> secure <b>the</b> sword <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrist. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> incorporates a simple cross-guard which frequently has a slender knucklebow attached. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> is usually entirely of iron, though brass and silver hilts are found, and is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tang {{of the blade}} by a very powerful adhesive resin. More ornate examples of the talwar often show silver or gold decoration in a form called koftgari.|$|R
25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends <b>to</b> drag <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|R
500|$|The most {{elemental}} {{sections of}} the khanjar are its handle and blade, with the material utilized in the former playing a significant role influencing the final price of the dagger. [...] Bone – specifically rhinoceros horn and elephant tusk – was once the common standard, as it was [...] "considered the best material" [...] <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> out of. [...] However, with the international ban on the ivory trade, the usage of other materials – such as wood, plastic, and camel bone – has become more prevalent.

[...] Levin also said that Blakelock's helmet had been passed around as a trophy, though he could not recall the names of those who had handled it.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been {{considered}} a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 71%, based on 17 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: [...] "Killer Klowns from Outer Spaces title promises darkly goofy fun – {{and more often than}} not, the movie delivers." [...] Leonard Klady of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination". Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB ("Strictly tenth-rate."), but gave the movie a second look after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. In his second review, Maltin wrote [...] "Routinely plotted, but vividly designed, with cheeky humor...plays its premise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt,</b> all 'circus' bases touched".|$|E

500|$|The rioters removed Blakelock's {{protective}} helmet, {{which was}} never found. Rose {{writes that the}} pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hilt.</b> His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His hands and arms were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one {{on the back of}} his right thigh, six on his face, and his jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right side of his head. Bowen said the force of this blow had been [...] "almost as if to sever his head," [...] which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him (according to Rose, the autopsy photographs did not support this).|$|E

50|$|The sword’s pommel is {{coated in}} {{a sheet of}} silver and {{consists}} of five distinct sections that slowly rise to a rounded tip in the middle. Below these sections is a band of silver decorated with a recessed pattern of swirls that loop around the pommel. The handle between <b>the</b> pommel and <b>hilt</b> is iron, suggesting that the sword was crafted for combat with a full tang - which is when a sword or knife consists of one solid piece of metal from end <b>to</b> end. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> of <b>the</b> sword is also coated in silver and bears the same swirl pattern as the band on the pommel.

50|$|The F-S {{fighting}} knife {{was designed}} exclusively for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade {{that can easily}} penetrate a ribcage.

2500|$|Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, {{that is a}} sword with a {{straight}} blade with one cutting edge and the opposite edge of the blade (the [...] "back") thickened {{for most of its}} length to give added strength. The blade was [...] in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord <b>to</b> resemble <b>the</b> same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of <b>the</b> blade <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> and blade a very secure connection. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim [...] long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending {{from the front of the}} guard.

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, it was used <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> <b>hilts</b> of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it <b>to</b> cover shields. <b>The</b> skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down <b>the</b> thorns <b>to</b> yield a mottled pattern.
