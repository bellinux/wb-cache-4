5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E

However, such rescue missions may never happen if the person is not known to still be alive, if {{the fact that they are}} missing is unknown or if the island is not mapped. These scenarios have given rise to the plots of numerous stories in the form of novels and film.|$|E

500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off,</b> only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is too late now to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off.</b> I see my situation but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off.</b> I see my situation, but I will die like a man".|$|E
500|$|The film {{includes}} four role-playing scenes. In the first, a man tells a girl {{that he will}} buy her a toy if she goes home with him. In the second, eight-year-old Natasha goes to her friend's house and finds that only her friend's father is home; after he intentionally spills water on her clothes, he tells her to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off.</b> The film cuts to Harris, who says, [...] "She should look him {{straight in the eye}} and tell him to stop, go away". In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E

500|$|The Quatermass Experiment was {{transmitted}} weekly on Saturday {{night from}} 18 July to 22 August 1953. Episode one ("Contact Has Been Established") was scheduled from 8.15 to 8.45 p.m.; episode two ("Persons Reported Missing"), 8.25–8.55 p.m.; episodes {{three and four}} ("Very Special Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Believed to be Suffering"), 8.45–9.15 p.m.; and the final two episodes ("An Unidentified Species" [...] and [...] "State of Emergency") from 9.00 to 9.30 p.m. Due to the live performances, each episode overran its slot slightly, from two minutes (episode four) to six (episode six). The long overrun of the final episode {{was caused by a}} temporary break in transmission to replace a failing microphone. Kneale later claimed that the BBC's transmission controllers had threatened to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the air during one significant overrun, to which Cartier replied, [...] "Just let them try!" [...] Some BBC documentation suggests that at least one transmitter region did cut short the broadcast of the final episode.|$|E
500|$|At age 5, Michael Albrecht, son of Tammy and Charles [...] "Chuck" [...] Albrecht, {{received}} his first baseball spikes {{and refused to}} <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off,</b> earning his now famous nickname. Chuck now runs a summer basketball camp at which Spike assists. Albrecht attended Taft Middle School in Crown Point before attending Crown Point High School where he averaged 21 points, 5 assists, 3 steals and 4 rebounds as a senior in 2011. Albrecht committed to Michigan on April 6, 2012. Albrecht led Northfield Mount Hermon School to the 2012 New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) Class AAA Boys' Basketball Tournament, defeating future Michigan teammate Mitch McGary's Brewster Academy in the semifinals. Albrecht was awarded the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament. Albrecht was a former Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teammate of McGary and future Michigan teammate Glenn Robinson III. Albrecht's father was college teammates with Zack Novak's father; a generation later, when Spike Albrecht was an incoming freshman, Zack Novak was Michigan's captain during the 2011-12 season.|$|E
500|$|By {{the morning}} of 9 June, the supply {{situation}} for Downs' company had become critical and 11th Brigade headquarters decided {{that it would be}} best to evacuate the beach. Up until that point casualties had been relatively light with only four killed and seven wounded, but the Japanese force, which had increased overnight to between 400 and 500 men as reinforcements arrived by barges and trucks from the Buka Passage area, launched a strong attack aimed at destroying the Australian force, attacking from three sides of the perimeter. In order to defend themselves the Australians called down heavy artillery fire from the battery of 25-pounders that was supporting them from its position on the Soraken peninsula. As the fighting intensified, some of the artillery shells were brought down as close as [...] from their own troops. Air support was also called in, with 16 RAAF Boomerangs and Royal New Zealand Air Force Corsairs attacking Japanese positions around the perimeter. As a result of these attacks, the Australians were able to hold off the Japanese attacks until 4:30pm when three assault landing craft arrived from Soraken to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the beach, and ferry them out to two larger vessels that were waiting further out to sea.|$|E

500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; it was like I was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{armoured}} cruiser Warrior {{had been}} crippled by numerous hits by German battleships around 18:30 {{and fell in}} with Engadine 10 minutes later. The former's rudder had been jammed full over and she continued to turn in tight circles until her steam was exhausted. At 19:45 Engadine attempted to take her in tow, but the jammed rudder prevented that until it was trained amidships. By 21:30 she was making [...] while her turbines were making revolutions for [...] Early the following morning Warriors progressive flooding had worsened and she was sinking. Captain Vincent Molteno ordered his ship abandoned after Engadine came alongside to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> at 08:00. One of Warriors guns punctured Engadines hull below the waterline as the former ship rolled in the moderate seas, but this was quickly patched. About 675 officers and enlisted men successfully {{made it to the}} much smaller Engadine which had to quickly distribute them to prevent her from capsizing. Among these were about 30 seriously wounded men who were transferred across in their stretchers; one man fell off his stretcher between the ships, but was rescued by Rutland against orders. For his bravery he was awarded the First Class Albert Medal for Lifesaving in gold and briefly became the only living recipient. The transfer was completed before 09:00 and Warrior sank shortly afterwards. Engadine remained with the BCF until early 1918 when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She was based out of Malta, conducting anti-submarine patrols, {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

2500|$|Ledbetter, {{having the}} only ship with wireless, and thereby {{able to keep}} in ready contact with Sophia, {{organized}} the rescue effort. [...] The rescue plan, although dangerous, and perhaps even desperate, was to wait until high tide at 5:00 covered the reef {{with at least a}} few feet of water. [...] This it was hoped would be enough to launch Sophias boats and use them to take the people from Sophia to the rescue ships. [...] Cedar had anchored in the lee of a nearby island for the night. [...] King and Winge, under captain J.J. Miller, had circled the Sophia all night, the only vessel to do so. [...] On arrival at 20:00 on Thursday, Ledbetter ordered searchlights shown on Sophia. [...] What he saw convinced him that no boats could be then launched. [...] Waves were breaking hard against the trapped steamship's hull, and the wind was rising.

2500|$|Following the war, Guderian {{said that}} he was one of the few generals to openly {{challenge}} Hitler over the way in which Germany was pursuing the war. In one such example, Guderian {{said that he}} opposed Hitler's directive to split up existing divisions' panzer regiments, in order to double the number of panzer divisions. In Guderian's view, it decreased their power, while doubling the need for support equipment and personnel. In another example, Guderian wrote that he had argued for the removal of the panzer crews from Africa in early 1943, as their skill and experience were difficult to replace and their tanks had been lost in the conflict, but that Hitler refused to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the continent. In addition, over the course of the war, as material and replacement crews became available, Hitler ordered the creation of new panzer formations. According to Guderian, he had wanted the men and material to be used to bring the existing formations up to strength instead. In his postwar recollection, another former Wehrmacht general, Hermann Balck, attributed Hitler's decision to create new formations to political reasons, in that it gave the appearance that Germany was still strong. Balck said that these formations and their inexperienced crews were not nearly as effective as the veteran formations, and the result was many unnecessary losses.|$|E
