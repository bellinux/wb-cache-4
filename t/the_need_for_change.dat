5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E

The trickster is attracted to change and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee. The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views on <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> In June 1976, Wałęsa lost {{his job at the}} Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{the way was}} Gary Wachs, son of Coney Island {{president}} Ralph Wachs, {{who with}} friends and family owned a majority of stock.

Some board members opposed relocating, including significant stockholder Charles Sawyer. It wasn't taken seriously until 1968, when actor Fess Parker announced plans to build a theme park in Northern Kentucky– well within Coney Island's primary market that extended as far south as Louisville. The announcement highlighted <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change</b> and gave Wachs' proposal credibility within the organization.|$|E

25|$|With unrest {{growing in}} the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the American Revolution, the British were worried that the Canadiens might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, Canadiens formed the vast {{majority}} of the settler population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and there was little immigration from Great Britain. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 Canadiens to the British crown, first Governor James Murray and later Governor Guy Carleton promoted <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the Canadien subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in the enactment of the Quebec Act of 1774.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying the American people would never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change</b> in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union.

500|$|British {{official}} historian Brigadier James Edward Edmonds, in 1925, recorded that [...] "The British Army of 1914 was {{the best}} trained, best equipped and best organized British Army ever sent to war". This was {{in part due to}} the Haldane reforms, and the Army itself recognising <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change</b> and training. Training began with individual training in winter, followed by squadron, company or battery training in spring; regimental, battalion and brigade training in summer; and division or inter-divisional exercises and army manoeuvres in late summer and autumn.

Near {{the end of the}} speech, Obama referred to words written by Thomas Paine in The American Crisis, which were ordered by George Washington to be read to his troops: [...] "Let it be told to the future world... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [...]" [...] Because Obama's campaign message focused on <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{even the}} minds of reformers like Gogel had become {{receptive}} to <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, {{who would like to}} finally push their reforms through, by [...] "Bonapartist" [...] means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, {{in the hands of the}} old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a [...] "National College" [...] (akin to the French Senate) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1851, New York Congressman William Duer alleged that Patterson {{had made the}} gold dollar too small in {{diameter}} on purpose to provoke criticism. Patterson retired that year after 16 years in his position, and under his successor, George N. Eckert, annular gold dollar and half dollar patterns were struck. Public Ledger reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in annular form, gold half dollars would be, to help fill <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> With the new Pierce administration, Thomas M. Pettit took office as Mint Director on March 31, 1853. [...] In April, Treasury Secretary James Guthrie wrote to Pettit that there were complaints that the gold dollar was too small, often lost or mistaken for a small silver coin, and enquired about reports that the Mint had experimented with annular dollars. [...] Pettit replied, stating that none had been preserved, but enclosed a silver piece of equivalent size. He noted that while there would be technical difficulties {{in the production of}} the annular dollar, these could be overcome. In a letter dated May 10, Pettit proposed an oval-shaped holed piece, or an angular-shaped coin, which would lessen the production problems. Pettit died suddenly on May 31; Guthrie did not let the issue fall, but queried Pettit's replacement, James Ross Snowden, concerning the issue on June 7. As U.S. coins were required to bear some device emblematic of liberty, the secretary hoped that artists could be found who could find some such design for an annular coin.|$|E
