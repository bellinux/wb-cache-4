In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an [...] "empowering" [...] ballad called [...] "Nobody Can Change Me". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day.

It doesn't see him often [...] Of late years, though {{he keeps the}} old {{homestead}} [...] And sends the children down there with their mother [...] To run wild in the summer--a little wild. [...] Sometimes he joins them {{for a day or}} two [...] And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.

He wouldn't have it so: [...] Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, [...] If not at heart, at least on principle. [...] Lately when coming up to Lancaster [...] His train being late he missed another train [...] And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction [...] After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired [...] To think of sitting such an ordeal out, [...] He turned to the hotel to find a bed. [...] "No room," [...] the night clerk said. [...] "Unless----" [...] Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps [...] And cars that shook and rattle--and one hotel. [...] "You say 'unless.'" [...] "Unless you wouldn't mind [...] Sharing a room with someone else." [...] "Who is it?" [...] "A man." [...] "So I should hope. What kind of man?" [...] "I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. [...] Separate beds of course you understand." [...] The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. [...] "Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? [...] Has he had the refusal of my chance?" [...] "He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. [...] What do you say?" [...] "I'll have to have a bed." [...] The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs [...] And down a narrow passage full of doors, [...] At the last one of which he knocked and entered. [...] "Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room." [...] "Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. [...] I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself." [...] The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. [...] "This will be yours. Good-night," [...] he said, and went. [...] "Lafe was the name, I think?" [...] "Yes, Layfayette.

[...] Hold on, there's something I don't think of now [...] That I had on my mind to ask the first [...] Man that knew anything I happened in with. [...] I'll ask you later--don't let me forget it." [...] The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. [...] A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, [...] He sat there creased and shining in the light, [...] Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. [...] "I'm moving into a size-larger shirt. [...] I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. [...] I just found what the matter was to-night: [...] I've been a-choking like a nursery tree [...] When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag. [...] I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. [...] 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, [...] Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. [...] Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?" [...] The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. [...] "Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen." [...] "Fourteen! You say so! [...] I can remember when I wore fourteen. [...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them. [...] They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you. [...] What makes you stand there on one leg like that? [...] You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you. [...] You act as if you wished you hadn't come. [...] Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous." [...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then. [...] 'My man' is it? You talk like a professor. [...] Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, [...] I'm thinking I have more to lose than you [...] If anything should happen to be wrong. [...] Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat! [...] Let's have a show down as an evidence [...] Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. [...] Come, if you're not afraid." [...] "I'm not afraid. [...] There's five: that's all I carry." [...] "I can search you? [...] Where are you moving over to? Stay still. [...] You'd better tuck your money under you [...] And sleep on it the way I always do [...] When I'm with people I don't trust at night." [...] "Will you believe me if I put it there [...] Right on the counterpane--that I do trust you?" [...] "You'd say so, Mister Man.--I'm a collector. [...] My ninety isn't mine--you won't think that. [...] I pick it up a dollar at a time [...] All round the country for the Weekly News, [...] Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?" [...] "Known it since I was young." [...] "Then you know me. [...] Now we are getting on together--talking. [...] I'm sort of Something for it at the front. [...] My business is to find what people want: [...] They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me--he's editor-- [...] Feel out the public sentiment--he says. [...] A good deal comes on me when all is said.

[...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a hay load a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest." [...] "One would suppose they might not be as glad [...] To see you as you are to see them." [...] "Oh, [...] Because I want their dollar. I don't want [...] Anything they've not got. I never dun. [...] I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. [...] I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. [...] Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. [...] I drink out of the bottle--not your style. [...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them." [...] "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style." [...] "But really I--I have so many collars." [...] "I don't know who I rather would have have them. [...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night.

40|$|As {{with any}} {{language}} or dialect, Australian English {{has its share}} of idiomatic expressions in which simple-seeming words come together to produce a meaning inexplicable without cultural translation and therefore destined to mystify newcomers to the language. It might even be the reason such expressions exist in the first place. They are the linguistic equivalents of handshakes in Masonic temples, of passwords whispered to guards at fortress gates. The ones I remember being particularly baffled by – we arrived, my mum, dad and me, in Australia in 1990; my sister stayed in Europe – are “it’s my shout” (oh the stories I could tell you…) and “bring a plate” (likewise), though perhaps most puzzling of them all was a single word, unhyphenated and modestly prefixed: “overqualified”. Where we were from, you couldn’t be too educated or too experienced for a professional, skilled job. Not so in Australia, it turned out, not for new arrivals anyway. My father’s periodic removal from his résumé of his Ukrainian/Soviet PhD in hydraulics – a bizarre ritual of self-administered shrinkage, necessary, he was told, to get a “foot in the door” – has been replicated across decades by migrants to this country. Particularly by migrants from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe: the non-West guild. Melbourne writer Ralph Johnstone has told of two Somali men, Abdulkadir Shire and Ali-nur Duale, who in the course of 17 years of “downskilling” crossed out any hint of their respective Masters in petrochemical engineering and PhD in applied entomology from 300 -plus job applications. Still no joy. Because who could be less employable than an overqualified alien? Ridiculous business, this practically standing on your head not to appear too smart to prospective employers. As a migrant you are already up against it, what with the language barrier and the close-to-zero social capital and the sometimes not actually owning a pair of employment-ready pants to wear to a job interview. And then, crazily, you are compelled to hide your goods. Most people routinely inflate their capabilities in CVs (“selling themselves”, it’s called) whereas these PhDed migrants – my father, once upon a time – have been doing what, precisely? As far as I can tell they have been doing the Great Australian Undersell. The smaller you make yourself, the bigger the chance of the square peg <b>that</b> <b>is</b> (<b>sort</b> <b>of)</b> you fitting the round hole that is Australia’s jobs market.

British-American cartoonist Gabrielle Bell sympathized with Brown's approach, which she described as [...] "talking about his feelings or his emotional state when he was illustrating it with striking images <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> absurd or a weird juxtaposition". Green's influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch Peter Pontiac, who drew inspiration from Binky Brown and Maus to produce Kraut (2000), about his father who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.|$|R
