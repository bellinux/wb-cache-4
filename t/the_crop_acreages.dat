In estimating the acreages of a specific croptype such as wheat, it is suggested to treat the problem as a two-crop problem: wheat vs. nonwheat, since this simplifies the estimation problem considerably. The error analysis and the sample size problem is investigated for the two-crop approach. Certain numerical results for sample sizes are given for a JSC-ERTS- 1 data example on wheat identification performance in Hill County, Montana and Burke County, North Dakota. Lastly, for a large area crop acreages inventory a sampling scheme is suggested for acquiring sample data and the problem of crop acreage estimation and the error analysis is discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGrain {{production}} {{is of great}} importance to any country, especially to China. It {{is very important for}} local and central governments to get accurate main <b>crops</b> <b>acreage</b> information in time. One noticeable problem is that the estimated accuracy for <b>crops</b> <b>acreage</b> in a certain year is not high, so that Remote Sensing Applications Centre (RSAC) has to use investigated data of <b>crops</b> <b>acreage</b> of two consecutive years to estimate the change rate of <b>crops</b> <b>acreage.</b> Aiming at <b>the</b> issue, the theory of double sampling based on operational <b>crops</b> <b>acreage</b> investigation was brought forward by RSAC.

40|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} multivariate {{techniques are}} used to classify pixels from remotely sensed data into specific crop and other land cover types. This approach, although useful in estimating the acreage planted to specific crops, tends to create a visually speckled (or noise filled) image where misclassification and/or missing crop areas occur in a field. Past research into reducing this effect included two types of pixel smoothing algorithms, edge preserving and classified spatial, both of which use the spatial information contained in the data (Winings, Ozga, and Stakenborg (1990)). This paper considers two additional approaches which also exploit the spatial component of the pixel data in the classification process. Simple Augmentation (Switzer (1980)), and Contextual Classification (Owen (1984)) methods are explored.

40|$|Nonresponse {{rates have}} been growing over time leading to {{concerns}} about survey data quality.

30|$|Forecasting acreage {{before the}} start of {{planting}} is crucial for several reasons. First, it serves as an indication of how much food will be available in the subsequent harvest season in the respective countries and for <b>the</b> respective <b>crops.</b> <b>The</b> selected countries in our acreage forecasting models are major players in the global food market, as are <b>the</b> four <b>crops</b> key staple crops in many countries. In other words, forecasting the amount of area allocated to these crops in these countries can be a sound signal to availability of food (a shortfall or an excess) in the international market. This has significant implications for global food security situations, in particular in food deficit (food importing) countries. For a given yield per hectare of land, forecasting acreage is an important first step in understanding and forecasting the entire production of <b>the</b> major <b>crops.</b> Second, <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> <b>acreage</b> elasticities indicate <b>the</b> extent to which food production (through acreage adjustments) responds to scarcity.

40|$|Abstract: For large areas, it is {{difficult}} to assess the spatial distribution and inter-annual variation of <b>crop</b> <b>acreages</b> through field surveys. Such information, however, is of great value for governments, land managers, planning authorities, commodity traders and environmental scientists. Time series of coarse resolution imagery offer the advantage of global coverage at low costs, and are therefore suitable for large-scale crop type mapping. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, however, the problem of mixed pixels has to be addressed. Traditional hard classification approaches cannot be applied because of sub-pixel heterogeneity. We evaluate neural networks as a modeling tool for sub-pixel <b>crop</b> <b>acreage</b> estimation. <b>The</b> proposed methodology {{is based on the assumption}} that different cover type proportions within coarse pixels prompt changes in time profiles of remotely sensed vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Neural networks can learn the relation between temporal NDVI signatures and <b>the</b> sought <b>crop</b> <b>acreage</b> information.

40|$|Purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus is an {{important}} weed in cotton (Gossypium spp.) production in Arizona. It is estimated that 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> <b>acreage</b> is infested. <b>The</b> technology available for selective control of purple nutsedge is not adequate and the infestation level of this weed is increasing. In 1986, the thiocarbamate herbicides, vernolate (Surpass), EPTC (Eptam, Genep) and butylate (Swan +, Genate plus) were evaluated as preplant and postemergence incorporated applications for selective control of purple nutsedge in cotton. There were 25 different trials conducted in Arizona cotton fields. Butylate was more selective to seedling cotton than EPTC and vernolate but all were capable of unacceptable cotton injury. Where preplant irrigations require every furrow irrigation, this concentrated the thiocarbamates in the seed row and resulted in less selectivity. Preplant treatments controlled purple nutsedge for 1 or 2 postemergence irrigations. Postemergence applications were most effective following preplant treatments but were not consistent in controlling nutsedge season -long. This research indicates that purple nutsedge lowered yields only when the cotton was stunted in growth by severe early season infestations. Wherever cotton established dominance over the weeds, yields were not affected. Preplant applications of butylate, if carefully adjusted for the growing conditions, can provide early season control of purple nutsedge...|$|R
