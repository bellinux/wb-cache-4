5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs {{in order to avoid}} them being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline over them, and then burn <b>them</b> <b>alive.</b> After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E
5|$|Michael Alexander writes that, as a translator, Pound was {{a pioneer}} with a great gift of {{language}} and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu, and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> {{at a time when}} poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.|$|E
5|$|The other event {{detailed}} in Last Order illustrates Zack and Cloud's escape from Shinra.

Zack escapes with Cloud from the Mansion {{with the intention of}} returning to Midgar, the headquarters of Shinra. However, Shinra orders their paramilitary and the Turks to find and eliminate the two escapees. Tseng decides to capture <b>them</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E

5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|The first {{definite}} {{record of}} his employment is dated 19 April 1477, and it shows {{that he was a}} singer at the chapel of René, Duke of Anjou, in Aix-en-Provence. He remained there at least until 1478. No certain records of his movements exist for the period from March 1478 until 1483, but if he remained in the employ of René he would have transferred to Paris in 1481 {{along with the rest of}} the chapel. One of Josquin's early motets, Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo, suggests a direct connection with Louis XI, who was king during this time. In 1483 Josquin returned to Condé to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed by the army of Louis XI in May 1478, when they besieged the town, locked the population into the church, and burned <b>them</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of <b>them</b> <b>alive,</b> but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E

5|$|The white-eyed river {{martin was}} seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not {{definitely}} since. There are unconfirmed sightings from Thailand in 1986 and Cambodia in 2004. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. This species may be extinct, but the IUCN will not categorise it as such until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted. Despite legal protection under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, it was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists. Following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers {{were reported to have}} caught as many as 120 and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> in captivity.

25|$|After {{a series}} of fires in 1741, the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in {{conspiracy}} with some poor whites. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites, who {{over a period of}} months were convicted of arson.

25|$|Often, {{in severe}} droughts, crops can fail as the soil {{does not contain}} {{sufficient}} moisture to keep <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> and this is usually the largest economic impact with £500 million ($830 million) worth of damage from failed crops in 1976. Another, more subtle impact is the insurance claims from damage to houses and businesses from fire and subsidence (caused by the dry and shrunken soil), sometimes amounting to over £50 million ($83 million) in severe droughts.|$|E

25|$|What {{happens to}} the Kaunians in the Darkness series is the {{equivalent}} to the Holocaust, where Kaunians under Algarvian control are systematically stripped of their rights and violence against them is ignored by the authorities. Eventually, Algarve, facing a desperate stalemate against Unkerlant, begins slaughtering Kaunians en masse to fuel vast quantities of death-energy-powered sorcery {{in an attempt to}} break the impasse. Mezentio's official aim is not to exterminate Kaunians but to win the war, thus Kaunians are provided with adequate food to keep <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> until they need to be sacrificed for the war effort.

Upon arrival, they engage German {{soldiers}} {{on the outskirts of}} Berlin, commencing the Battle of Berlin.

Reznov is unwilling to deny his men their revenge and gives Dimitri the choice of shooting them or burning <b>them</b> <b>alive</b> with molotov cocktails. They head into the U-Bahn and start fighting German soldiers around the platforms, until a surge of water fills the tunnel and Dimitri, unable to avoid the oncoming tidal wave, almost drowns.|$|E
25|$|Their float was {{stocked with}} biscuits, chocolate, Horlicks tablets, Bovril pemmican, 22 gallons (100 litres) {{of water and}} 2 gallons (9 litres) of massage oil for use against exposure. There was also a sail, which they rigged as a {{makeshift}} shelter. After three days of rough weather the sea calmed and the raft drifted. The men's health deteriorated, but the ration cans had keys to open them, and from one of these White improvised a fishing hook. He untwisted the fibres of a rope and made them into a fishing line. With this they caught about 50 fish, which they ate raw. This gave the survivors both protein and nutritious fish oil, which improved their health and did much to keep <b>them</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E
