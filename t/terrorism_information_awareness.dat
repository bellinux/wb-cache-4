50|$|Total Information Awareness (TIA) was {{a program}} of the United States Information Awareness Office that began during the 2003 fiscal year. It {{operated}} under this title from February until May 2003, before being renamed as the <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness.</b>|$|E
50|$|The report {{arrived on}} May 20. It {{disclosed}} that the program's computer tools {{were still in}} their preliminary testing phase. Concerning the pattern recognition of transaction information, only synthetic data created by researchers was being processed. The report also conceded that a full prototype of TIA wasn't scheduled to be ready until the 2007 fiscal year. Also in May, Total Information Awareness was renamed <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness</b> {{in an attempt to}} stem the flow of criticism on its information gathering practices on average citizens.|$|E
50|$|The IAO began funding {{research}} and development of the Total Information Awareness (TIA) Program in February 2003 but renamed the program the <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness</b> Program in May that year after an adverse media reaction to the program's implications for public surveillance. Although TIA was only one of several IAO projects, many critics and news reports conflated TIA with other related research projects of the IAO, with the result that TIA came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of IAO programs.|$|E

[...] In this report, IAO changed {{the name of the}} program to the <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness</b> Program and emphasized that the program was not designed to compile dossiers on US citizens, but rather to research and develop the tools that would allow authorized agencies to gather information on terrorist networks. Despite the name change and these assurances, the critics continued to see the system as prone to potential misuse or abuse.|$|E

40|$|Data mining is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} key features of many homeland security initiatives. Often used as a means for detecting fraud, assessing risk, and product retailing, data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets. This report discusses the data mining uses (i. e. <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness</b> (TIA) Program) and issues (i. e. data quality, interoperability, privacy), as well as the limitations of data mining...|$|E
40|$|The government's {{ability to}} obtain and analyze {{recorded}} information about its citizens {{through the process}} known as data mining has expanded enormously over the past decade. Although the best-known government data mining operation (Total Information Awareness, more recently dubbed <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Awareness)</b> supposedly no longer exists, large-scale data mining by federal agencies devoted to enforcing criminal and counter-terrorism laws has continued unabated. This paper addresses three puzzles about data mining. First, when data mining is undertaken by the government, does it implicate the Fourth Amendment? Second, does the analysis change when data mining is undertaken by private entities which then make the data or data analysis available to the government? Third, if the Fourth Amendment does impose some restrictions on government data mining, what might they look like? Current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence appears to leave data mining completely unregulated, while most commentators have called for stringent regulation or a prohibition on large-scale operations such as TIA. This paper takes an intermediate position on these issues. The proposed framework requires attention {{to the type of}} records obtained via the data mining, {{the extent to which they}} can be connected to particular individuals, and the government's goal in obtaining them. Based on proportionality reasoning that I have applied in other contexts, the highest degree of justification for data mining should be required when the data is private in nature and sought in connection with investigation of a particular target. In contrast, data mining that relies on impersonal or anonymized records, or that is sought in an effort to identify a perpetrator of a past or future event, need not as strictly regulated. In aid of this project, I describe a study that investigated lay views on data mining...|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhat {{is an effective}} methodology for intelligence and <b>terrorism</b> <b>information</b> sharing within a private passenger rail organization and with their external public partners? This thesis uses three distinct research methodologies that collectively lead to an effective strategy for intelligence and <b>terrorism</b> <b>information</b> sharing within a private passenger railroad, and with its external public partners (Chapter III) : 1. Key Amtrak personnel will be interviewed to establish and confirm how intelligence information currently flows within Amtrak and with its external intelligence community and law enforcement partners (Chapter II). 2. A survey of key Amtrak operations personnel to establish Amtrak's intelligence priorities and requirements (Chapter IV). 3. Two case studies on potential models for intelligence and <b>terrorism</b> <b>information</b> sharing (Chapters V and VI). There were two outcomes from this research: (1) by leveraging the power of informal networks {{in the context of}} the abstract megacommunity framework, an effective strategy for intelligence and <b>terrorism</b> <b>information</b> sharing was developed; and (2) based on the needs of front line railroad operating personnel, an intelligence product that helps to protect the public and the nation's critical railroad infrastructure was developed.
