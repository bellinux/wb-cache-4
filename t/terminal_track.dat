25|$|Track 61 is an {{industrial}} rail <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> in South Boston, Massachusetts, {{also known as}} the Boston Terminal Running Track. Track 61 is the last remnant of the vast rail yards that once covered much of the South Boston waterfront. Track 61 legally begins at Summer Street, while the line from Bay Junction to Summer Street is the Boston Terminal Running Track and Terminal Yard. However, the names are frequently used interchangeably.|$|E
25|$|Dulverton was {{a passing}} place for trains from the outset. The main buildings, {{including}} {{a house for}} the station master, were on the eastbound platform. This was connected by a covered footbridge to the westbound platform. A second track was added {{on the south side}} for the Tiverton service in 1902; initially a <b>terminal</b> <b>track,</b> it became a loop line in 1910. The goods shed was in a small yard {{on the north side of}} the line, but further sidings were added on the south side of the station, where there was also a small turntable. The first signal box was at the west end of the south-side sidings; it was replaced in 1908 by one on the eastbound platform next to the goods shed. Goods traffic ceased from 6 July 1964. The signal box was closed on 31 July 1966 and the old eastbound platform was then used for trains in both direction for the remaining two months before the line closed. The station buildings survived as part of the Caernarvon Arms Hotel.|$|E

5000|$|The Llobregat-Anoia Line uses four metre gauge <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> located under Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes at its {{intersection}} with Plaça Espanya. The four {{tracks are}} at two different levels. The tracks {{on the upper}} level are served {{by a pair of}} 159 m side platforms, whilst the tracks on the lower level are served by an island platform. The four <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> converge, west of the station, into a single pair of tracks carrying all train services.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1954, {{along with the}} rest of the branch from the {{junction}} at Gràcia station. It has a single <b>terminal</b> <b>track,</b> which ends at a buffer within the station. Just outside the Gràcia end of the station, this track diverges into the twin running tracks of the L7. The <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> is flanked on both sides by 66 m long platforms, which can accommodate a three car train.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two tracks for {{passenger}} trains; {{one is a}} <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> facing towards Cape Town {{and the other is}} a through track. They are accessed by a single platform attached to the station building, which lies on the western side of the tracks.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} new simple Dual-input current-mode integrator/differentiator {{structures}} using differential voltage current conveyor (DVCC) are presented. The proposed circuits {{are composed of}} one DVCC and three passive components. The effects of the DVCC <b>terminal</b> <b>tracking</b> errors are analyzed, which shows that the time constants (tau) are practically active-insensitive. Compensation design equations are derived for correcting the value of tau that was altered due to the <b>terminal</b> <b>tracking</b> errors of the DVCC.

50|$|Uetliberg station lies some 650 m from, and 56 m below, {{the summit}} of the Uetliberg. The station has two <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks,</b> and a {{substantial}} station building, including a restaurant.|$|R
5000|$|Barcelona Metro line 1 (L1) uses {{a pair of}} through Iberian gauge tracks located {{directly}} below Plaça Espanya. These tracks are served {{by a pair of}} 92 m side platforms. Previously, there had existed a third <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> and platform, allowing trains from the city center to terminate at the station.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} three tracks, {{although}} the track nearest the station {{building is a}} <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> only accessible from the south. The tracks are served by four platform faces, but only those of the island platform between the through tracks are in normal use. This platform is accessed by footbridge, stairs, and lifts.|$|E
50|$|The station {{building}} {{is on the}} side platform, and is flanked {{at each end of the}} station by two terminal platform tracks; the <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> to the south is in occasional use by terminating passenger trains, but the one to the north is normally used to stable the Bellinzona tunnel rescue train.|$|E
50|$|Latina station counts a large one-floor building, located {{close to}} the freight shed. It counts 4 tracks for {{passenger}} service and 5 <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks,</b> in the northern side, for goods wagons.|$|R
50|$|Koblenz {{station has}} {{a total of}} ten {{platform}} tracks on four platforms, seven of which are through-tracks (1 to 5, 8 and 9) and three are <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> (104, 105 and 109).|$|R
50|$|The station lies some 650 m from, and 56 m below, {{the summit}} of the Uetliberg, to which it is linked by a footpath. It has two <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks,</b> and a {{substantial}} station building, including a restaurant.|$|R
50|$|To {{the east}} of the station, the Meiringen-Innertkirchen railway crosses a level {{crossing}} and to {{the east of}} this is a further platform and <b>terminal</b> <b>track.</b> This was previously used by the Meiringen-Innertkirchen railway as its terminus, before a reorganisation of track and electrification systems allowed its extension into the main station.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the rail <b>terminal,</b> <b>track</b> work, and road access further civil engineering works was required {{as part of the}} plan, mainly environmental mitigation, including diversion of St. Catherine's Well Stream, landscaping, flood mitigation and drainage, footpaths, cyclepaths and bridleways. Developer estimates of job creation were over 4,000 jobs net created on site as a direct result when fully operational.|$|E
50|$|The {{funicular}} accepts Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) tickets, and {{the station}} therefore has ticket machines and barriers {{identical to those}} of all other Barcelona metro stations. The station has twin platforms, {{one on each side}} of the <b>terminal</b> <b>track.</b> Because of the gradient at the upper end of the funicular, the stations platforms are stepped, but disabled access is provided to the upper step of the platform.|$|E
40|$|A {{data-driven}} predictive terminal iterative {{learning control}} (DDPTILC) approach is proposed for discrete-time nonlinear systems with <b>terminal</b> <b>tracking</b> tasks, where only the <b>terminal</b> output <b>tracking</b> error instead of entire output trajectory tracking error is available. The proposed DDPTILC scheme {{consists of an}} iterative learning control law, an iterative parameter estimation law, and an iterative parameter prediction law. If the partial derivative of the controlled system with respect to control input is bounded, then the proposed control approach guarantees the <b>terminal</b> <b>tracking</b> error convergence. Furthermore, the control performance is improved by using more information of predictive terminal outputs, which are predicted along the iteration axis and used to update the control law and estimation law. Rigorous analysis shows the monotonic convergence and bounded input and bounded output (BIBO) stability of the DDPTILC. In addition, extensive simulations are provided to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
5000|$|Tracks 21 and 22 are {{underground}} <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{served by}} a single island platform, and located on the southern side of the station. These are used by SZU S-Bahn trains, heading west and south towards Uetliberg and the Sihl valley.|$|R
5000|$|Tracks 3 to 18 are <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> {{located at}} ground level, served by two side {{platforms}} and seven island platforms.

50|$|In {{the first}} decades, the border {{crossing}} was not rigorously secured, but between 1975 and 1980, Gutenfürst station was fortified. Major projects were {{the construction of}} a bridge over all the tracks, a large floodlight system with eight masts and a <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> for local services within the GDR towards Plauen, which was outside the strictly secured control zone. Overall, the reconstruction cost 16 million marks and some works continued until 1982.|$|E

50|$|BCR {{has three}} {{distinct}} operating areas. The 64.1 mi northern {{portion of its}} rail system connects with the Delmarva Central Railroad in Pocomoke City (north) and the system's car float in Cape Charles, Virginia. A car float, crossing 26 mi of the Chesapeake Bay from Cape Charles to Norfolk, comprises the middle portion. The {{southern end of the}} system is a <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> around Little Creek, Virginia, connecting with Norfolk Southern Railway, CSX Transportation, and the Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad.|$|E
50|$|Future {{plans are}} for L2 to be {{diverted}} at Sant Antoni, via an interchange with L3 at Poble Sec, to Barcelona Airport. This diversion will render {{the section of}} L2 from Sant Antoni to Paral·lel, and the L2 <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> at Paral·lel, redundant.|$|R
50|$|On {{either side}} of the station are tracks leading to the Rockaway Park Yard. Originally, <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> with {{low-level}} platforms occupied the yard area during the LIRR years. The area of the current high-level platform was part of the LIRR depot yard.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} [...] {{was closed}} in mid-2008 for complete reconstruction. The two <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> {{either side of}} a narrow island platform were replaced by a single track between two platforms, one for arriving passengers and the other for departing (Spanish solution). It reopened on 2 March 2009.|$|R
50|$|Angermünde {{station is}} west of central Angermünde. The station {{building}} is {{east of the}} tracks. The station has two island platforms with four tracks for passenger traffic. At {{the northern end of}} the western platform, there is an additional <b>terminal</b> <b>track.</b> Freight facilities are close to the northern end of the passenger station. The line to Schwedt branches directly in the platform area from the other tracks so that only tracks 1 and 2 can be used by trains to and from Schwedt.|$|E
50|$|The {{north and}} south halls house three through tracks (without platforms) that run in a southeasterly {{direction}} past the terminal hall. The eastern sections of platforms 1 and 2 are {{also referred to as}} platforms 1a and 2a. The north hall also houses an additional through track without platform. During the refurbishment works carried out since 2000, the platform height was adjusted to meet current standards. The east wing originally had a second <b>terminal</b> <b>track,</b> but only platform track 4 is still in use.|$|E
50|$|The Scarborough line {{opened in}} March 1985 as the Scarborough RT. Three {{years after it}} opened, the TTC renovated its southwestern {{terminus}} at Kennedy station, because the looped turnaround track, designed for uni-directional streetcars under the earlier plan and not needed for the bi-directional ICTS trains, was causing derailments; it was replaced with a single <b>terminal</b> <b>track</b> and the station was thus quasi-Spanish solution, with one side for boarding and another side for alighting, though the boarding side is also used for alighting during off-peak hours and weekends.|$|E

50|$|South of the {{passenger}} station, there are numerous goods, loading and storage sidings, {{some of which are}} still in use. Since the rebuilding work carried out in the last few years, however, these are exclusively <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> and only accessible from the north. Only the three platform tracks can still be operated in both directions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>tracks</b> {{were of a}} stub-end design, {{meaning that}} all trains had to back into the station from the main line tracks via a wye to reach the station's platforms. The station also had {{additional}} tracks for storage and servicing of passenger cars {{as well as a}} roundhouse and turntable, allowing locomotives to be serviced on site.|$|R
