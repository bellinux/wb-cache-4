25|$|There {{are three}} types superfinishing: <b>Through-feed,</b> plunge, and wheels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Through-feed</b> : This type of {{superfinishing}} is {{used for}} cylindrical workpieces. The workpiece is rotated between two drive rollers, which also move the machine as well. Four to eight progressively finer abrasive stones are used to superfinish the workpiece. The stones contact the workpiece at a 90° angle and are oscillated axially. Examples of parts that would be produced by process include tapered rolls, piston pins, shock absorber rods, shafts, and needles.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>through-feed</b> {{centerless}} grinding, {{the workpiece}} is fed through the grinding wheels completely, entering {{on one side}} and exiting on the opposite. The regulating wheel in <b>through-feed</b> grinding is [...] away from the plane of the grinding wheel {{in such a way as}} to provide a lateral force component, feeding the workpiece through between the two wheels. <b>Through-feed</b> grinding can be very efficient because it does not require a separate feed mechanism; however, it can only be used for parts with a simple cylindrical shape.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between honing and grinding is always same. Some grinders have complex movements and are self-truing, and some honing machines {{are equipped with}} in-process gaging for size control. Many <b>through-feed</b> grinding operations rely on the same averaging effect as honing.|$|E
50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} is {{when the}} workpiece {{is supported by a}} blade instead of by centers or chucks. Two wheels are used. The larger one is used to grind the surface of the workpiece and the smaller wheel is used to regulate the axial movement of the workpiece. Types of centerless grinding include <b>through-feed</b> grinding, in-feed/plunge grinding, and internal centerless grinding.|$|E

50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} uses purpose-built {{centerless grinding}} machines. Such a machine will always include the grinding wheel, regulating wheel, and some means of supporting a workpiece. Modern machines may involve {{computer numerical control}} to allow automation and improve precision. Grinding wheels are interchangeable, to allow for different grits and shapes. Machines designed to accommodate <b>through-feed</b> grinding operations will allow {{the angle of the}} regulating wheel to be adjusted, to accommodate parts of different sizes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Through-feed</b> {{centerless}} grinding is a precision finishing process used to manufacture circular components. This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the <b>through-feed</b> {{centerless grinding}} process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the plunge centerless grinding process was developed. This simulation was experimentally verified {{by comparing the}} harmonic spectra of simulated workpieces with the spectra of workpieces ground with similar set-up parameters. The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94). The plunge lobing analysis was then extended to the <b>through-feed</b> case {{by means of an}} average growth rate chart. This chart characterizes the workpiece lobing stability for a given <b>through-feed</b> set-up. Again, experimental studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of this model and it was determined that the average growth rate chart was effective in assessing the workpiece lobing stability for the case of short workpieces like bearing rings. ^ To address the problem of controlling the workpiece cylindrical form, a simulation of the workpiece supporting system was developed. These results confirmed the accuracy of previous researcher 2 ̆ 7 s analytical estimates of the proper regulating wheel shape. It was also proposed to use this type of simulation as an objective function to optimize the workpiece guidance system for specific applications. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation method for investigating the form generation mechanism in the centerless grinding process is described. In this work, instantaneous {{change of the}} apparent depth of cut during grinding was modeled using absolute coordinate systems. The result of the simulation was not affected by the coordinate system (the location of the reference circle center and the radius of the reference circle). Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, wheel specification, regulating wheel speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the grinding machine. Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D <b>through-feed</b> centerless grinding simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D <b>through-feed</b> simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying flat length. To validate these models, simulation results were compared with the experimental results. It was found that the number of lobes and the angular displacement of peaks and corresponding valleys of the simulation results were identical with those of the roundness profiles of ground workpieces. Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the <b>through-feed</b> centerless grinding exists. The effects of the center height angle (β), the number of workpiece rotations, the regulating wheel tilt angle (φ), and the slope of the grinding wheel inlet crown on the geometric tolerance of a cylindrically centerless ground workpiece were investigated. ...|$|E
