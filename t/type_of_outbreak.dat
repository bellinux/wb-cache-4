The authors aimed to assess the number of foodborne Salmonella outbreaks that occurred in France in 1995 using a capture-recapture approach. Data from three sources—the National Public Health Network (NPHN), the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), which receives mandatory notification, and the National Salmonella and Shigella Reference Center (NRC) —were collected. Matching algorithms permitted identification of matched outbreaks. The total number of outbreaks was estimated by log-linear modeling taking into account source dependencies and the variable catchability. The final estimate was adjusted for the positive predictive value (66 %) of the NRC case definition. The dependence between the NPHN and the MA was also evaluated {{by means of a}} qualitative survey. A total of 716 foodborne Salmonella outbreaks were reported to the three sources, and 108 matches were identified. The best-fitting model, taking into account a positive dependence between the NPHN and MA sources, gave an estimate of 757 outbreaks. The sensitivity was 15 % for the NPHN, 10 % for the MA, and 50 % for the NRC.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, an {{increase}} in reports of human cases of Salmonella enterica serovar Ohio infection was observed in Belgium. During 11 weeks, between 1 July and 13 September, 60 cases of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Ohio infection were reported to the National Reference Centre for Salmonella, with a peak onset of symptoms in {{the third week of}} July. All clinical isolates caused self-limiting gastroenteritis; both genders (32 males and 28 females) and all age groups (three children 65 years of age) were affected. The isolates were distributed throughout Belgium but a cluster of several cases was observed around Brussels. At the same time, an increase in the incidence of this serovar was observed in the Salmonella isolates originating from the official surveillance campaign conducted by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, which identified pork as a likely source of the outbreak strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing confirmed the clonal relationship between the human isolates, the isolates from samples collected in the cutting plants, and the isolates from pork meat in distribution. Further epidemiological investigations indicated that one particular slaughterhouse was involved. In that slaughterhouse, the carcasses were contaminated during the evisceration process because of contaminated equipment and uncontrolled environmental conditions.

A minimum dataset for SyS that includes the essential data to achieve all surveillance objectives while minimizing the amount of data collected should be defined. One can then compile an inventory of the data sources available and evaluate each using the criteria developed (3). A list of syndromes should then be produced for all data sources.

Five were women; the median age was 70 years (range 54 – 93). None of the cases were immunocompromized and none died. Six cases were identified in TaYS, and one in another university hospital in southern Finland. All had eaten goat cheese produced on the implicated farm. S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus was isolated from throat swabs, fresh goat cheese, milk tank, and vaginal samples of one goat. All human and environmental strains were indistinguishable by ribotyping and PFGE. Conclusion The outbreak was caused by goat cheese produced from unpasteurized milk. Outbreaks caused by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus may not be detected if streptococcal strains are only typed to the group level. S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus may be a re-emerging disease if unpasteurized milk is increasingly used for food production. Facilities using unpasteurized milk should be carefully monitored to prevent this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{three years}} from 1950, the author had made studies on each case of the {{so-called}} “Izumi-Fever” which had been prevalent in Okayama prefecture, and had also statistically contemplated the reaults. The author, moreover, made many experiments about the infection routes, using the agent isolated from the patients. The results are as follows: 1) The incidence takes at first the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> mass <b>outbreak</b> and then gradually shifts to that of sporadic one. 2) As for the infection routes, both of the water-borne and droplet infections seem to be possible. 3) There are not rare, but rather many cases of the secondary infection. 4) In order to corroborate the inference obtained by the epidemiological studies on the infection routes, the author gave the pathogenic agent to hamsters and mice by various routes; in this experiment, the alimentary and droplet infections were established, but the one by insects was not successful...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{framework}} for bioinformatics assisted biosurveillance and early warning {{to address the}} inefficiencies in traditional surveillance {{as well as the}} need for more timely and comprehensive infection monitoring and control. It leverages on breakthroughs in rapid, high-throughput molecular profiling of microorganisms and text mining. Results This framework combines the genetic and geographic data of a pathogen to reconstruct its history and to identify the migration routes through which the strains spread regionally and internationally. A pilot study of Salmonella typhimurium genotype clustering and temporospatial outbreak analysis demonstrated better discrimination power than traditional phage <b>typing.</b> Half <b>of</b> the <b>outbreaks</b> were detected {{in the first half of}} their duration. Conclusion The microbial profiling and biosurveillance focused text mining tools can enable integrated infectious disease outbreak detection and response environments based upon bioinformatics knowledge models and measured by outcomes including the accuracy and timeliness <b>of</b> <b>outbreak</b> detection. </p...|$|R
40|$|In a {{widespread}} <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> aseptic meningitis {{during the summer}} and early fall of 1961 in Ontario, Echo type 25 virus was found to be the predominant virus type isolated from affected patients. Recovery of Echo 25 virus in several cases from the CSF of patients strongly suggests an etiological relationship between this virus type and the illness. The causative role of the virus was confirmed by demonstration of significant immunological response in patients found to be infected with the virus. The presence of antibodies to Echo 25 virus in about 70 % of meningitis patients, from whom no virus was isolated, indicates that the infection in the population of the affected areas was much more prevalent than the number of successful virus isolations would suggest. It is recommended that Echo 25 virus should be added to the series <b>of</b> Echo virus <b>types</b> capable <b>of</b> causing <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> aseptic meningitis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Public health {{departments}} in the United States are beginning to gain timely access to health data, often {{as soon as one}} day after a visit to a health care facility. Consequently, new approaches to outbreak surveillance are being developed. When cases cluster geographically, an analysis of their spatial distribution can facilitate outbreak detection. Our method focuses on detecting perturbations in the distribution of pair-wise distances among all patients in a geographical region. Barring outbreaks, this distribution can be quite stable over time. We sought to exemplify the method by measuring its cluster detection performance, and to determine factors affecting sensitivity to spatial clustering among patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with respiratory syndromes. Methods The approach was to (1) define a baseline spatial distribution of home addresses for a population of patients visiting an emergency department with respiratory syndromes using historical data; (2) develop a controlled feature set simulation by inserting simulated outbreak data with varied parameters into authentic background noise, thereby creating semisynthetic data; (3) compare the observed with the expected spatial distribution; (4) establish the relative value of different alarm strategies so as to maximize sensitivity for the detection of clustering; and (5) measure factors which have an impact on sensitivity. Results Overall sensitivity to detect spatial clustering was 62 %. This contrasts with an overall alarm rate of less than 5 % for the same number of extra visits when the extra visits were not characterized by geographic clustering. Clusters that produced the least number of alarms were those that were small in size (10 extra visits in a week, where visits per week ranged from 120 to 472), diffusely distributed over an area with a 3 km radius, and located close to the hospital (5 km) in a region most densely populated with patients to this hospital. Near perfect alarm rates were found for clusters that varied on the opposite extremes of these parameters (40 extra visits, within a 250 meter radius, 50 km from the hospital). Conclusion Measuring perturbations in the interpoint distance distribution is a sensitive method for detecting spatial clustering. When cases are clustered geographically, there is clearly power to detect clustering when the spatial distribution is represented by the M statistic, even when clusters are small in size. By varying independent parameters <b>of</b> simulated <b>outbreaks,</b> we have demonstrated empirically the limits of detection <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> </p...|$|R
