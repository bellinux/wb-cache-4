5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed it in that genus with a query. Oryzomys is a living genus that has occurred in the United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E

25|$|A counter {{argument}} to opponents of compulsory voting is <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> systems the individual {{still has the}} practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot.

However, Singer argues that even the appearance of voluntary participation is sufficient to create an obligation to obey the law.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{very small}} number of {{buildings}} in the Romanesque style, such as Autun Cathedral in France and Monreale Cathedral in Sicily in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> cases there is a direct imitation of Islamic architecture. At other late Romanesque churches such as Durham Cathedral, and Cefalù Cathedral, the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of Gothic architecture.|$|E

25|$|According to Mahmood Mamdani, {{prior to}} colonization, {{indigenous}} societies {{did not necessarily}} consider land private property. Alternately, land was a communal resources that everyone could utilize. Once natives began interacting with colonial settlers, {{a long history of}} land abuse followed. Extreme examples of this include Trail of Tears, a series of forced relocations of Native Americans following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and the apartheid system in South Africa. Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe points out <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> instances, natives were not only driven off land, but the land was then transferred to private ownership. He believes that the “frenzy for native land” was due to economic immigrants that belonged to the ranks of Europe’s landless.|$|E

Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|Narrow {{doors and}} small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger {{openings}} are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Portuguese Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arcade openings, {{separated by a}} pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. There were some number of buildings in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons and it is believed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> cases {{there is a direct}} influence of Mozarabic and/or Islamic architecture. At other late Romanesque churches the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of Gothic architecture.|$|E

25|$|Other animals, {{including}} most insects and many fish, have larger females. This {{may be associated}} with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm—larger females are able to produce more eggs. For example, female southern black widow spiders are typically twice as long as the males. Occasionally this dimorphism is extreme, with males reduced to living as parasites dependent on the female, such as in the anglerfish. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss Dicranum and the liverwort Sphaerocarpos. There is some evidence <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females.|$|E
25|$|The earlier Buddhist constructions {{have proved}} more durable than the Islamic period buildings. The Top-Rustam is 46 m (50 yd) in {{diameter}} {{at the base}} and 27 m (30 yd) at the top, circular and about 15 m (50ft) high. Four circular vaults are sunk in the interior and four passages have been pierced below from the outside, which probably lead to them. The base of the building is constructed of sun-dried bricks about 60cm (2ft) square and 100 to 130mm (4 or 5 in) thick. The Takht-e Rustam is wedge-shaped in plan with uneven sides. It is apparently built of pisé mud (i.e. mud mixed with straw and puddled). It is possible <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> ruins we may recognize the Nava Vihara described by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang. There are the remains of many other topes (or stupas) in the neighbourhood.|$|E
25|$|Nathan Nunn and Diego Puga {{note that}} though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, {{prevents}} travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage. The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for {{variables such as}} diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{analysis}} from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, {{up to and}} including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible {{to determine the extent to}} which her language had regressed.|$|E
