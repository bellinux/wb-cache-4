She also created a mobile <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> for Chanel that was displayed in Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York in 2008.

5|$|Marquis' {{interest}} in the West was first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers who had spent a year there. Marquis and a colleague at the Herald resolved to save for a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. It seemed she might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> continued until March.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergency}} {{management of the}} 6. 3 Mw L’Aquila (Centre of Italy) earthquake occurred on 6 April, 2009 was an important test case for the Italian National Fire Department, especially as regards the implementation, in the immediate post-earthquake emergency, of <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> in order to safeguard the damaged cultural heritage. This differs from previous experiences, both for {{the size of the}} intervention and because the National Fire Department, for the first time, set up a technical unit specifically devoted to the standardization and coordination of <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> implemented by the fire-fighters. The memory discusses the reasoning that led to the elaboration of the Vademecum STOP (Field handbook containing Technical fact-sheets for <b>temporary</b> <b>works)</b> which has permitted the standardization of the most common <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> and represents an useful tool for the design and realisation of the structures. The issue of the organization of specific functional interfaces with MiBAC and Universities is dealt with. Quantitative data on the whole <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> managed by the National Fire Department after the earthquake are given and argued. Some considerations that might be a starting point for further improvements, both in terms of procedures for detecting and evaluating the damage and for designing <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> to be carried out by fire-fighters, are also presented. Finally the current activities of the National Fire Department in the field of <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> in seismic emergency scenarios, at national and international level, are briefly illustrated...|$|R

5|$|Konrad Kujau {{was born}} in 1938 in Löbau, near Dresden, in what would become East Germany. His parents, a {{shoemaker}} and his wife, had both joined the Nazi Party in 1933. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Hitler; Germany's defeat and Hitler's suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He {{held a series of}} menial jobs until 1957, when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone from the Löbau Youth Club. He fled to Stuttgart, West Germany, and soon drifted into <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> and petty crime. After running a dance bar during the early 1960s with his girlfriend, Edith Lieblang—whom he later married—Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself. He told people that his real name was Peter Fischer, changed his date of birth by two years, and altered the story of his time in East Germany. By 1963 the bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties, and Kujau started his career as a counterfeiter, forging 27 Deutsche Marks' (DM) worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although it provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau's lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to Stuttgart's Stammheim Prison.|$|E
5|$|Yakut Khan {{landed at}} Sewri on 14 February 1689, and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690. After a payment {{made by the}} British to Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal Empire, Yakut {{evacuated}} Bombay on 8 June 1690. The arrival of many Indian and British merchants {{led to the development}} of Bombay's trade by the end of the seventeenth century. Soon it was trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian cities of Mecca and Basra. By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas. By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south. He established the Marine force, and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay. In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli. The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 1735 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite the arguments in favour of the application of computers in <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design, as highlighted in previous research, {{there was a lack}} of suitable software at the start of this research. The main objective of this research has been to design and develop software for a major <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> item. Formwork design was selected from several classes as it provided a larger problem domain. Achieving the main objective necessitated the establishment of a strategy for implementing software in <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design using a systems engineering approach. After studying the state-of-the-art of computer application in engineering, construction, and <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design, an integrated program network strategy was established for implementing software in <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design. This involved the coupling of microcomputer-based packaged Computer-Aided Drafting and Database Management Systems with <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design applications. The coupling was achieved through the combination of a database/executive approach. This strategy was then used to design, develop, and validate a computer-aided design system for formwork. To establish the formwork design process, contemporary formwork design methods were studied by reviewing literature and holding informal discussions with eight practicing formwork designers. This study, coupled with an analysis of the formwork designer's. tasks, enabled a functional specification to be produced for a computer-aided design system for formwork. This was used to establish six individual modules that make up the system as follows: a formwork database management module; a concrete pressure modelling module; a rational formwork design module; a detailed form work design module; a drafting module; and a schedule of quantities and cost quotation module. A windowing and menu based human-computer interface was designed and developed for the applications to be developed. The system was produced by designing, developing and testing individual modules, which were finally integrated to form a comprehensive Formwork Integrated Computer-Aided Design System (FICADS). The functions integrated include the analysis/design, drafting, scheduling of quantities, and cost estimating of formwork. The system was tested and assessed by means of several case studies and demonstrations to expert form work designers which proved favourable. The main achievement has been the development of a computer-aided design system for formwork that was acceptable to formwork designers. In the development of the system, a conceptual framework within which <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> design systems can be developed with great flexibility, confidence and a minimum of programming effort has been established...|$|R
