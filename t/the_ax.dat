25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from <b>the</b> <b>ax</b> handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|E

500|$|F-Zero GX {{features}} numerous gameplay modes and options. In the Grand Prix mode, {{the player}} races against twenty-nine opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. There are four cups available (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, and Diamond) with five tracks in each. Unlocking <b>the</b> <b>AX</b> cup gives the player all six tracks from the arcade game, F-Zero AX. Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert, and Master. Players get {{a certain amount}} of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the circuit is the character who receives the most total points. If the player has a [...] "spare machine"—the equivalent of an extra life—then the race can be restarted even if the player falls off a track or runs out of energy. A predetermined amount of spare machines based on the difficulty level chosen are given to players before starting a cup. Players get an additional spare machine for every five contenders he or she eliminates, and each eliminated contender recovers a portion of the player's energy meter. Competitors can be damaged and eliminated by means of a spin or side attack.|$|E
500|$|The {{fifth and}} sixth stages ended in bunch sprints, with Cavendish and André Greipel the victors respectively. After stage six, Daryl Impey became the first South African rider to wear the yellow jersey. His {{teammate}} Gerrans ensured it for him by holding back at the finish allowing Impey– who was second overall– the time necessary to replace him {{at the top of}} the general classification. Sagan claimed the seventh stage from a bunch sprint in Albi, with [...] rider Blel Kadri talking the polka dot jersey. In stage eight, the Tour's first mountain stage, which ended at <b>the</b> <b>Ax</b> 3 Domaines, Froome attacked a select five-rider group, which included Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde, as they passed the lone leader Nairo Quintana with [...] remaining. Froome took the stage win, fifty-one seconds ahead of his teammate Richie Porte, with Valverde third a further seventeen down. Contador and Quintana finished one minute forty-five seconds behind Froome. Froome's victory win put him in the lead of the general and mountains classifications, ahead of Porte. In the ninth stage, Froome managed to subdue attacks from his rivals, although his team's efforts left him isolated for the majority of the stage. After a descent from the mountain pass of La Hourquette d'Ancizan, a group of twenty-three riders came into the finish in Bagnères-de-Bigorre, where Dan Martin (...) beat Jakob Fuglsang (...) from sprint, twenty seconds ahead of the group. Porte lost eighteen minutes, dropping from second overall to thirty-third, with Valverde moving up to second. Rolland took back the polka dot jersey. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.|$|E

Furthermore, Nickelodeon published a collection called SpongeBob SquarePants: Get to Work! on iTunes.

Also, the voice actress rendition of Rei Ayanami, Brina Palencia, was very well received by fans for her performance as Rei, and many noted it was on par with Amanda Winn-Lee's performance, or in some cases, surpassing hers; Animation Insider described Palencia's voice-acting of Rei as having [...] "subtle hints of emotion lingering under her facade".

2500|$|A human's karmic acts {{result in}} merits and demerits. Since {{unconscious}} things {{generally do not}} move except when caused by an agent (for example, <b>the</b> <b>ax</b> moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law [...] of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues {{there must be a}} conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons [...] have earned [...] by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [...] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits. Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences. Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different [...] "just" [...] consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., Vishnu (King of Kings).|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial test}} {{model of the}} Polaris was {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>AX</b> series and made its maiden flight from Cape Canaveral on September 24, 1958. The missile failed to perform its pitch and roll maneuver and instead just flew straight up, however the flight was considered a partial success (at that time, [...] "partial success" [...] was used for any missile test that returned usable data). The next flight on October 15 failed spectacularly when the second stage ignited on the pad and took off by itself. Range Safety blew up the errant rocket while the first stage sat on the pad and burned. The third and fourth tests (December 30 and January 9) had problems due to overheating in the boattail section. This necessitated adding extra shielding and insulation to wiring and other components. When the final AX flight was conducted a year after the program began, 17 Polaris missiles had been flown of which five met all of their test objectives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{authorities}} {{believed that}} suggestive remarks from his father, who {{knew all about}} his son's crimes, had led him to commit violence. During the investigation, his father was arrested three times but released because close relatives could {{not be forced to}} testify against other family members. After Ion's last crime, when he robbed a cashier, his mother visited him and found the money under his pillow. His father made him go to the crime scene and showed him what he had done. He then took the money and placed it in his Caracal home, intending to use it to buy a new house. His father was first brought in to the police station during one of Ion's silent phases; the son merely gave his father an ugly look, prompting the latter to say [...] "How should I know what you did? How?" [...] But he had reason to suspect it, as he had been washing his son's bloody clothes after the attacks. After Ion robbed the cashier, Florea confiscated <b>the</b> <b>ax</b> and knife and it was with these that he was secretly returning when he was arrested.|$|E
