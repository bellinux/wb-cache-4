5|$|Development {{took about}} a year and a half, with the team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin <b>Theme</b> <b>Park,</b> released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> World (known as Sim <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> in some territories) and <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created <b>Theme</b> <b>Park</b> was because he wanted players to create their dream <b>Theme</b> <b>Park.</b> Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a <b>theme</b> <b>park,</b> or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Tourism is a {{relatively}} new research field in China. <b>Theme</b> <b>parks,</b> being a branch of tourism industry, were firstly introduced to Chinese people two decades ago. However, the current situation and issues of Chinese <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> has not been well studied. This research intended to explore the relationship between Chinese culture and <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> as well as problems of the existing Chinese <b>theme</b> <b>parks.</b> Tourist behaviour, tourism market segmentation, culture transmission theory and Hofstede’s culture theory were applied in the research. Twenty-one semi-structured in-depth interviews and two focus groups were pursued for data collection. Based on the data analysis, two main findings were identified: the segmentation of Chinese <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> is rather crude; and the themes lack originality and uniqueness...|$|R

30|$|Because {{they are}} {{recreational}} facilities {{that depend on}} an extremely volatile visitor attendance, delivering high customer satisfaction is vital for <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> and consequently, risk—in particular, functional risk—control also becomes crucial. In the case of <b>theme</b> <b>parks,</b> one of the functional risks that is most exposed to the customers’ perception is waiting time. Waiting time works as {{an important factor in}} the customer’s decision making process, along with cost, especially in service facilities such as <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> (Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995), and previous studies show that waiting time is one of the factors that promotes a negative relationship (Bielen and Demoulin 2007) and conflict (Houston et al. 1998) between the service provider and the customers. However, the volatile visitor attendance makes it difficult for <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> to properly predict the demand for individual attractions, which often lead to longer waiting time in <b>theme</b> <b>parks</b> (Luo et al. 2004).|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that simulation inside physical environment affected both consumer cognitive and emotional reactions (Robert and John 1982).

(2004) emphasized the role of attractions within the <b>theme</b> <b>park’s</b> physical environment, as attractions are the main factor determining visitor’s individual preferences of <b>theme</b> <b>parks.</b> Milman (2001) also highlights the importance of managing visitors’ perspectives through attraction management to meet their expectations of interactive adventure, fantasy, and mystery at <b>theme</b> <b>parks.</b> In this study, customer satisfaction survey results for individual attractions at Samsung Everland will be used in conjunction with the operational efficiency of the attractions to analyze how each attraction contribute to customer satisfaction in relation to its efficiency.|$|R
