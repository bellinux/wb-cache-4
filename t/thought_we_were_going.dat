500|$|Anodyne was Uncle Tupelo's only {{recording}} {{to appear}} on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart. Despite the lack of a single to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in New York City. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, [...] "people here <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo." ...|$|E
500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. I think they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that." [...] Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration.|$|E

500|$|At first I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to work on}} one song; {{that was}} the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and {{take it from there}} -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; {{it was the only thing}} she had to work on.|$|E
500|$|Collaborations include [...] "Matando", [...] "Rociarlos" [...] (also {{featuring}} Hector El Father) and [...] "Baila Así" [...] with Queen's then-husband, Gran Omar; {{a hip-hop}} track, [...] "Quítate Two", with Fat Joe; [...] "Acércate" [...] with Mikey Perfecto, [...] "Tócame" [...] with salsa singer La India and [...] "Vas A Morir" [...] with Puerto Rican duo Getto & Gastam. [...] "Soldados" [...] and [...] "Dee Jay" [...] were co-written with Kasseem Dean and Omar Navarro, respectively. [...] "People <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to make a}} salsa track", Queen said about the collaboration with La India, noting that the song was a dancehall track (not salsa or reggaetón). She added that India was [...] "original" [...] and she worked well {{with people who are}} genuine, explaining the other collaborations. According to Navarro and Queen in an 2004 interview on mun2 The Roof, the album was expected to feature a duet with Puerto Rican singer Don Omar. Spin saw Queen's collaboration with Fat Joe as a trend in reggaetón to have American rappers [...] "team up with its stars".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|At first, Eon FM played {{songs that}} [...] "would not be played elsewhere", having no {{playlist}} and avoiding Top 40 songs.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} avoided collision using evasive maneuvers {{once they}} were in visual proximity, and passed within about 135m of each other. An unidentified passenger told NHK, [...] "I {{have never seen a}} plane fly so close. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to crash." [...] Alex Turner, a passenger on Flight 907 and a student at Kadena High School, a school for children with parents stationed at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture, estimated that the avoidance maneuver lasted for two seconds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cognitive {{science has}} been {{dominated}} by the computational conception that cogniton is computation across representations. To the extent to which cognition {{is supposed to be a}} purposive, meaningful, algorithmic, problem-solving activity, however, computers appear to be incapable of cognition. They are devices that can facilitate computations on the basis of semantic grounding relations as special kinds of signs. Even their algorithmic, problem-solving character arises from ther interpretation by human users. Strictly speaking, computers as such [...] apart from human users [...] are not only incapable of cognition but even incapable of computation, properly construed. If we want to understand the nature of <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have to study thinking, not computing, because they are not the same thing...|$|R

[...] "We were getting married, which is why I wanted to do the role," [...] she said. [...] "I thought {{that we were going to}} show what it’s like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated. There are a lot of story points and ideas I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to hit upon, but they decided to take it another route." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dershowitz, in {{his book}} Taking the Stand, recounts that von Bülow had a dinner party after he {{was found not guilty}} at his trial. Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a [...] "victory party", and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for [...] "several {{interesting}} friends". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bulow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife's arm and said: [...] "Let's get out here. I think this guy is innocent.

2500|$|The {{scheduled}} flight departed from Melbourne as planned at 22:30 using the [...] Runway 16. [...] {{before the end}} of the runway, travelling at a speed of , the captain ordered the first officer to rotate. [...] As the aircraft pitched upward it failed to leave the ground and the tail section struck and continued to scrape along the runway. The captain took over the controls and applied maximum thrust on all four engines by using the Take-off/Go-around (TOGA) detent. After exhausting the entire length of the runway, the aircraft failed to become airborne, and did not leave the ground until [...] beyond the end of the runway. The captain later said [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to die. It was that close".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a {{delegation}} of activists, including Glover and activist/professor Cornel West, {{in a meeting with}} President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. [...] In 2006, Glover began working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti. [...] It was reported that Chavez supported the film, [...] "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression." [...] In a 2015 interview, Glover said: [...] "The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture...that was the movie that I wanted to do. We’ve developed a script. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get it done four years ago." [...] As of 2017, Toussaint had not been completed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not serve}} overseas during World War II, primarily because it never reached full strength for an Airborne Infantry Battalion. [...] In reaction to the German counterattack that began the Battle of Bulge, the Airborne Command considered reorganizing the 555th PIB as a single reinforced Airborne Rifle Company, and sending it to Europe to reinforce the battered Airborne units already there. [...] However, before this could happen the crisis had passed, and the 555th PIB was instead alerted for deployment to the West Coast. [...] The men of the 555th PIB hoped that they would get into {{the war against the}} Japanese, but that was not their new mission. According to Sergeant Walter Morris, [...] "It was a secret mission called Operation Firefly. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> overseas to [...] MacArthur's theater." [...] It wasn't until they arrived in Oregon, in May 1945, that they learned they would be fighting the Japanese on the fire line in the Western United States.|$|E

And, oh! they have been telling me such terrible things--but they can't be true--that our dear father had been killed; and that it was you, Chebron, who killed dear Paucis; but of course I did not believe them--I knew it was all their wickedness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea, sir. I <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> up {{the creek}} that Lieutenant Hopkins {{explored}} the other day, {{to have another}} look at the prahus; but as we came down the river instead of going up, of course it is not that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} might be, {{but that would}} be their own faults for {{thinking}} nasty things.

5000|$|In {{the post-war}} era, Americans {{struggled}} {{to absorb the}} lessons of the military intervention. As General Maxwell Taylor, one of the principal architects of the war, noted, [...] "First, we didn't know ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> into another Korean War, but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies… And we knew less about North Vietnam. Who was Ho Chi Minh? Nobody really knew. So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business. It's very dangerous." [...] President Ronald Reagan coined the term [...] "Vietnam Syndrome" [...] to describe the reluctance of the American public and politicians to support further international interventions after Vietnam.|$|R

6000|$|... "What fun {{was there}} in chasing the junks?" [...] Simmons said.

Of course I am not blaming Oliphant, for the captain's orders <b>were</b> strict that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not to try to cut the junks out if they got under the guns of any of their batteries. Still it was horribly annoying, and I do think the captain might have remembered what beastly luck we had last time, and given us a chance tomorrow." ...|$|R
