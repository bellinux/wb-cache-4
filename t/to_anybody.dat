5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> {{who died of}} fright while watching the film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E
5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

60|$|And {{then one}} realizes {{that all the}} wild storms of anxiety and frenzy were only so much {{breaking}} of eggs. It isn't our business <b>to</b> live <b>anybody's</b> life, or <b>to</b> die <b>anybody's</b> death, except our own. Nor <b>to</b> save <b>anybody's</b> soul, nor <b>to</b> put <b>anybody</b> in the right; nor yet in the wrong, which is more the point to-day. But to be still, and to ignore the false fine frenzy of the seething world. To turn away, now, each one into the stillness and solitude of his own soul. And there {{to remain in the}} quiet with the Holy Ghost which is to each man his own true soul.|$|R
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E

Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing fellatio on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so {{that he does not}} say anything <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> else. He even asks Finn to a Yankees game, which Finn does not attend. Finn soon quits the job out of fear.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the state}} is still obliged to give {{permanent}} shelter for free <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> who needs better living conditions or has no permanent registration, because the right to shelter is still included in the constitution. Several projects of special cheap 'social' flats for those who failed to repay mortgages were proposed to facilitate mortgage market.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{sequencing}} {{of subject matter}} is concerned, it is the constructivist viewpoint that the foundations of any subject may be taught <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> at any stage in some form (Duffy and Jonassen 1992). This means that instructors should first introduce the basic ideas that give life and form to any topic or subject area, and then revisit and build upon these repeatedly. This notion has been extensively used in curricula.|$|E

25|$|A hundred police {{officers}} were present throughout Chen's press conference on 21 February, and some citizens complained about the waste of manpower. The police emphasised the importance of maintaining public order {{in light of the}} great public and media interest in the case. The triads reportedly offered a HK$500,000 reward <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> who hacked off Chen's hand. This contributed to fears for Chen's safety upon his return, and heavy police protection.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 the Theosophical Society {{established}} the Order of the Star in the East (OSE) {{to prepare the}} world for the expected appearance of the World Teacher. Krishnamurti was named as its head, with senior Theosophists assigned various other positions. Membership was open <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> who accepted the doctrine of the Coming of the World Teacher. Controversy soon erupted, both within the Theosophical Society and outside it, in Hindu circles and the Indian press.|$|E

I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism do not {{generally}} require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings {{similar to those}} worn by men, and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the bimah), not for modesty, but as a feminist gesture of egalitarianism. Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a head covering (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is often no requirement. However, kippot may be provided <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> who wishes to wear them.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Oracle changed Berkeley DB's license {{from the}} Sleepycat license to the Affero General Public License, thus restricting {{its use in}} a wide variety of applications. This caused the Debian project to exclude the library from 6.0 onwards. It was also criticized that this license is not {{friendly}} to commercial redistributors. The discussion was sparked over whether the same licensing change could happen to LMDB. Author Howard Chu made clear that LMDB is part of the OpenLDAP project, which had its BSD style license before he joined, and it will stay like it. No copyright is transferred <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> by checking in, which would make a similar move like Oracle's impossible.|$|E

25|$|Some days later, Bhim Chand sent {{a message}} to Anandpur, asking the Guru to lend the Prasadi {{elephant}} to him. Bhim Chand wanted the elephant to make a display of his wealth to the guests at his son's proposed wedding. The Guru suspected that Bhim Chand wanted to gain permanent possession of the elephant, and declined the Raja's demand. He stated that the devotee who had presented the elephant didn't want it to be given away <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> else. Bhim Chand is said to have sent his emissaries thrice to the Guru, the last one being Raja Kesari Chand of Jaswal. However, the Guru didn't accept his demand, and refused to part with the elephant.|$|E
25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E
25|$|Princess Carolyne {{lived with}} Liszt {{during his years}} in Weimar. She {{eventually}} wished to marry Liszt, but since she had been previously married and her husband, Russian military officer Prince Nikolaus zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Ludwigsburg (1812–1864), was still alive, she had to convince the Roman Catholic authorities that her marriage to him had been invalid. After huge efforts and a monstrously intricate process, she was temporarily successful (September 1860). It was planned that the couple would marry in Rome, on October 22, 1861, Liszt's 50th birthday. Although Liszt arrived in Rome on October 21, the Princess declined to marry him that evening. It appears that both her husband and the Tsar of Russia had managed to quash permission for the marriage at the Vatican. The Russian government also impounded her several estates in the Polish Ukraine, which made her later marriage <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> unfeasible.|$|E
