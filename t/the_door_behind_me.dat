60|$|With {{this she}} turned and stepped quickly from the room. I followed, closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Making him as {{comfortable}} as possible on the bed, I left the room, locking <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{went out}} and shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and stood and thanked God {{from the bottom of}} my heart.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> opened <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>the</b> valet {{stood waiting}} on the threshold.|$|R
60|$|I was in <b>the</b> study, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> locked <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> {{before they}} could arrive at an understanding. I sprang to the window.|$|R
6000|$|Her eyes {{rested on}} {{me for a moment}} with a {{deepening}} expression of distrust, then looked away again. She began to turn pale. [...] "You are not like yourself to-night," [...] she said. Without a word more, she took her hat and cloak and went out before me into the square. I followed her, closing <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> She made an attempt to induce the child to approach her. [...] "Come, darling," [...] she said, enticingly--"come and take my hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then go {{into that}} {{opposite}} room," [...] said she, pointing at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> with her withered hand, [...] "and wait there till I come." ...|$|E
6000|$|Minikin re-entered {{with papers}} in his hand. [...] "In you go," [...] he said. [...] "Heaven help you!" [...] And I passed in and closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I despised the {{emphatic}} growl at my back; only, being much vexed and upset, I {{regret to}} say that I slammed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> in a most undignified manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{your own}} time. There is no hurry. I dare {{say you will}} find there all you may want. I shall remain on the terrace until you summon me." [...] With that I {{went out on the}} terrace, drawing close <b>the</b> glass <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|After this {{no other}} Fung {{appeared}} upon the wall, so I turned {{my attention to}} the spy-hole in <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and seeing some horsemen moving about {{at a distance of}} four or five hundred yards on a rocky ridge where the mist did not lie, I opened fire on them and at the second shot was fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle. One of those with him, who must have been a brave fellow, instantly jumped down, threw him, dead or living, over the horse, leaped up behind him, and galloped away accompanied by the others, pursued by some probably ineffective bullets that I sent after them.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave out}} another ringing peal, ran off {{into her own}} room, and slammed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her, leaving <b>me</b> profoundly astounded. I stopped {{laughing}} at once.|$|R
60|$|When I {{got back}} to my room I locked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and went to sleep in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was no child,' said startled Anna. 'How should {{any child}} come in when I shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> after I go out? All the keys of the flats are different.' ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{inside of}} Mr. Woodward's library, the {{merchant}} closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and then {{invited me to}} take a seat beside his desk, at the same time throwing himself back in his easy chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I will go by all means," [...] I answered: and I {{was glad}} of the {{unexpected}} opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I {{slipped out of}} the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> quietly <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It is {{needless to}} dwell upon the {{sensation}} this discovery gave me; happily I was {{within a few}} yards of the committee-rooms, and into these I dashed, closing and bolting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and mounting <b>the</b> stairs like a flash. The committee was in solemn session, sitting in a nice, even row on the front benches, each man with his elbows on his knees, and his chin resting in the palms of his hands--thinking. At each man's feet lay a neglected copy of the Bugle. Every member fixed his eyes on me, but no one stirred, none uttered a sound. There was something awful in this preternatural silence, made more impressive by the hoarse murmur of the crowd outside, breaking down <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I could endure it no longer, but strode forward and snatched up the paper lying {{at the feet of}} the chairman. At the head of the editorial columns, in letters half an inch long, were the following amazing head-lines: ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{had entered}} the church and closed <b>the</b> heavy <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> sense of {{darkness}} and loneliness in all their horror enfolded me round. The great church seemed a living mystery, and served as an almost terrible background to thoughts and remembrances of unutterable gloom. My adventurous life has had its own schooling to endurance and upholding one's courage in trying times; but it has its contra in fulness of memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me dear," [...] {{answered}} the O'Kelly, snatching his pipe {{from his mouth}} and thrusting it, still alight, into his trousers pocket. I made {{the rest of the}} descent by myself, and slipping out, closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> as noiselessly as possible.|$|E
60|$|She was blazing with {{eagerness to}} see one of those already celebrated murderers, and she started on the errand at once. I slipped out the back way, locked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> put the key in my pocket and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{answered}} by a waiter--a mere lad. As {{the light in}} the passage fell on my face, he paused in the act of addressing me, and drew back a few steps. Without stopping for any explanations, I closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and said to him at once: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had barely}} passed the threshold, before <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was closed <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> I heard the selfish old brute rub his hands, and chuckle over {{his success in}} {{shutting}} me and my sorrow both {{out of the room}} together.|$|R
60|$|As <b>the</b> big <b>door</b> swung <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> I {{caught the}} echo of a roar of {{laughter}} that {{went up to the}} ceiling of the bank. Since then I bank no more. I keep my money in cash in my trousers pocket and my savings in silver dollars in a sock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Porter {{had gone}} to bed, so I let myself out. I shut <b>the</b> hall <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this morning, or any {{reason to think that}} any {{stranger}} had been to the house. Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair. I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{it shall}} be just as you like. Now try and get to sleep again. I shall leave you {{for an hour or}} two, and send off Phoebe, and then bring you some breakfast. I'll lock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> so that the girl mayn't come in by chance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost before I knew it I was {{standing}} inside {{and the old}} woman, muttering to herself, had closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> With a queer sensation of being trapped I followed my host into the room, and taking the proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the {{capacity}} of Oscar's friend," [...] I answered. [...] "You will get rid of us both to-morrow." [...] I banged <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and went up-stairs. If I had been Mr. Finch's wife, I believe I should have ended in making quite an agreeable man of him.|$|E
60|$|I found Mabane and Arthur alone, {{for which}} I was {{sufficiently}} thankful. There {{was no longer}} any excuse for delay. Mabane had taken possession of the easy-chair, and was smoking his largest pipe. Arthur was walking restlessly {{up and down the}} room. Evidently they had been discussing between them the events of the afternoon, for there was a sudden silence when I entered, and they both waited eagerly for me to speak. I closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> carefully <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and took a cigarette from the box on my desk.|$|R
60|$|I believe I took Firefly {{the best}} of thirty miles that {{afternoon}} and brought her back in the half-light, my saddle discoloured with her sweat. I clanked into the hall like a captain of horse. The night was sharp with the first touch of autumn, and a huge backlog lay on the irons. Around it, in a comfortable half-circle sat our guests, Grafton and Mr. Allen and Philip smoking and drinking for a whet against supper, and Mrs. Grafton in my grandfather's chair. There was an easy air of possession about the party of them {{that they had never}} before assumed, and the sight made me rattle again, <b>the</b> big <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I went to <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He was {{an elderly}} gentleman. He made to sweep by me; but I barred his way, and closed <b>the</b> {{editorial}} <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> He seemed surprised; but I {{told him it}} was impossible for him to see the editor that afternoon, and suggested his writing his business on a sheet of paper, which I handed to him for the purpose. I remained in that ante-room for half an hour, and during that time I suppose I must have sent away about ten or a dozen people. I don't think their business could have been important, or I should have heard about it afterwards. The last to come was a tired-looking gentleman, smoking a cigarette. I asked him his name.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he stepped}} outside quickly, and I {{followed}} his example, closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> lest father {{should attempt to}} say something {{in the nature of}} a farewell, which I knew would unnerve me, because I believed it was exceedingly dangerous for any of our party to move around the city.|$|E
6000|$|I {{passed in}} and closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Hilda {{looked at me}} with trustful eyes. Resolute still, her face was yet that of a hunted creature. [...] "Thank Heaven, I have ONE friend here, at least!" [...] she said, slowly seating herself. [...] "You saw me catch and conceal the needle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Amram gravely. [...] "Let {{the issue}} prove me. Now descend {{that you may}} lock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> When I return I will stand in the open space yonder with a slave, making pretence to re-bind a burst bundle of merchandise. Then come down and admit me without fear." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first metaphorical {{usage of}} [...] "iron curtain", {{in the sense}} of an end of an era, perhaps should be {{attributed}} to British author Arthur Machen (1863–1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel The Three Impostors: [...] " [...] [...] [...] <b>the</b> <b>door</b> clanged <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> with <b>the</b> noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life". It is interesting to note the English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of [...] "clang" [...] with reference to an [...] "iron curtain", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.|$|R
6000|$|The talk {{went on as}} lopsidedly as before, and I {{began to}} get sleepy. I made bold to yawn, but Alderling did not mind that, and then I made bold to say that I thought I would go to bed. He {{followed}} me indoors, saying {{that he would go}} to bed, too. The hall was lighted from a hanging-lamp and two clear-burning hand-lamps which the widow had put for us on a small table. She had evidently gone home, and left us to ourselves. He took one lamp and I the other, and he started up stairs before me. If he were not coming down again, he meant to let the hanging-lamp burn, and I had nothing to say about that; but I suggested, concerning <b>the</b> wide-open <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "Shall I close <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Alderling?" [...] and he answered, without looking round, [...] "I don't shut it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{decided to}} leave the soap once again in 2004. She commented [...] "I'd been back for five years and had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were {{struggling}} with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was shut <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never.” ...|$|R
