5|$|This {{stage was}} {{extremely}} climbing-intensive, with three categorized high mountains, including a mountaintop {{finish with a}} very difficult gradient at Monte Petrano, and a smaller climb about a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> into the stage. It also had five short uncategorized hills. Following the alterations to Stage 10, this was also called the queen stage of the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, about a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> between Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb {{at this time}} was Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.|$|E
5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E

5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend only a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, {{so that there was}} no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
25|$|Eric Stiller and Tony Brown unsuccessfully {{attempted}} circumnavigation of Australia. The trip {{ended in}} failure roughly a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through. Described {{in the book}} Keep Australia on your left (2002).|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} is a masonry and brick domed tower, attached to two barrel-vaulted service sections in decreasing heights, all pointed white. The {{structure is}} surrounded by a white picket fence. The light is shone through a 2 x 1 m horizontal slit, about two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up <b>the</b> tower.|$|R

25|$|Pirate Latitudes {{was found}} as a {{manuscript}} {{on one of}} his computers after his death and was published in November 2009. Additionally, Crichton had completed the outline for and was roughly a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through a novel titled Micro.

25|$|In this mechanism, pollen tube {{elongation}} is halted {{when it has}} proceeded {{approximately one}} <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through the style. The female component ribonuclease, termed S-RNase probably causes degradation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) inside the pollen tube, {{in the case of}} identical male and female S alleles, and consequently pollen tube elongation is arrested, and the pollen grain dies.|$|E
50|$|Lowland longjaw galaxias are {{slender and}} elongate, having {{colouration}} consisting of spots and indistinct bands of various shades of brown and grey. The single dorsal and anal fins are about two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> along <b>the</b> body.

Facilities here include a wheelchair accessible picnic area, barbecues and toilets.|$|R
2500|$|F {{reviewer}} Charles de Lint {{gave the}} novel a mixed review. [...] "There {{are all sorts}} of interesting things going on in it. But the book is slow going since it takes about two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through before much of a plot kicks in[...] [...] [...] That first half to two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> Mendoza in Hollywood does make for an engrossing, if desultory reading experience." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{continuous}} unimodal distributions {{the median}} often lies between {{the mean and}} the mode, about one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> going from mean to mode. In a formula, median ≈ (2 × mean + mode)/3. This rule, due to Karl Pearson, often applies to slightly non-symmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution, {{but it is not}} always true and in general the three statistics can appear in any order.|$|E
25|$|The other novel, titled Micro (published posthumously in 2011), is a techno-thriller that {{explores the}} outer edges of new science and technology. The novel {{is based on}} Crichton's notes and files, and was roughly a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{finished}} when he died. HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham and Crichton's agent Lynn Nesbit looked for a co-writer to finish the novel; ultimately, Richard Preston was chosen to complete the book.|$|E
25|$|The nine-point {{circle of}} the general {{triangle}} has an analogue in the circumsphere of a tetrahedron's medial tetrahedron. It is the twelve-point sphere and besides the centroids of the four faces of the reference tetrahedron, it passes through four substitute Euler points, one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from the Monge point toward {{each of the four}} vertices. Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.|$|E
50|$|No {{points were}} scored in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game until two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through when Botica kicked a fifth penalty goal. David Myers scored Wigan's second try and <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match in the 77th minute. Just before the {{full-time}} whistle, Joe Lydon successfully kicked a field goal, adding {{insult to injury}} and making the final score Wigan 21, Penrith 4.|$|R
50|$|Longjawed galaxias are {{slender and}} elongate, having {{coloration}} consisting of spots and indistinct bands of various shades of brown and grey.

50|$|An {{unregistered}} copy of EV Nova is more limited. In {{addition to}} the attacks by Cap'n Hector, certain ships and technologies cannot be obtained after the thirty-day trial ends, and even before then, the game's story lines stop about two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through, and plug-ins are not supported. Once the game has been registered, Cap'n Hector and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other restrictions disappear from the game.|$|R
25|$|If {{the strip}} is cut along about a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{in from the}} edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the {{original}} strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but thin strip with two full twists in it – this is a neighborhood of {{the edge of the}} original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.|$|E
25|$|The nave and aisle have fine 15th-century roofs. The nave {{has four}} arch-braced {{principals}} or composite cruces and the roof has been strengthened by a triangular truss one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down the nave. The massive beam of this truss has a decorative mould {{which is likely}} to be early 16th-century and may represent a strengthening of the structure {{at the same time as}} the campanile was placed on the tower. The three tiers of quatrefoils roof wind-braces are likely to belong to the Victorian restoration. In the north aisle, there are arch-braced principals with foiled apex struts and two tiers of decorative wind-braces.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from the Monge point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at {{the midpoint of the}} corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E
50|$|Nearby named craters include Degana in the {{northeast}} and Baucau in the west, also other nearby named craters are in the south including Bunge, Ruza and Magadi, the latter is in the southeast, those are in the Argyre quadrangle lying about 75 km south from the crater center. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Degana is a valley named Her Desher Vallis, another valley is almost to the east and is Nirgal Vallis.|$|R
50|$|The up {{line from}} Tonteg to Pwllgwaun, about two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Trehafod, was closed as a running line {{and used as}} a wagon storage siding form 1943. In the period 11 October 1943 to 7 September 1944 a total of 119 American {{locomotives}} were stored on this section in connections with the preparations for the Normandy landings and their aftermath. The line was closed entirely as a through route in June 1951.|$|R
500|$|US10, US60, and US90 only ran {{about two}} <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> across <b>the</b> country, while US11 and US60 ran {{significantly}} diagonally. [...] US60's violation <b>of</b> two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventions {{would prove to}} be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major sticking points; US60 eventually was designated as US66 in 1926, and later it became popular in the culture. [...] US101 continues east and then south to end at Olympia, Washington. [...] <b>The</b> western terminus <b>of</b> US2 is now at Everett, Washington.|$|R
25|$|The Blue Jays {{started the}} 2002 season with slow {{progress}} in performance. Buck Martinez was fired about a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through the season, with a 20–33 record. He {{was replaced by}} third base coach Carlos Tosca, an experienced minor league manager. They went 58–51 under Tosca to finish the season 78–84. Roy Halladay was relied on as the team's ace and rose {{to the challenge of}} being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19–7 record and 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by Carlos Delgado. Promising young players were assigned to key roles; starting third baseman Eric Hinske won the Rookie of the Year Award at the season's conclusion, and 23-year-old centre fielder Vernon Wells had his first 100 RBI season.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among the}} {{endeavours}} {{pursued by the}} Company during its early years were the construction of railroads and telegraph wires across the territory it governed. These respective arteries of transport and communication, vital both for the successful development of the new country and for the realisation of Rhodes's Cape to Cairo dream, were laid across the previously bare Rhodesian landscape with great speed. Strategically planned, the railways were not intended or expected {{to turn a profit}} during their early years; their construction was largely subsidised by the Company. The telegraph line from Mafeking in South Africa reached Salisbury—one <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from Cape Town to Cairo—in February 1892. Just under six years later, in December 1897, the Bechuanaland railway from Vryburg reached Bulawayo, making it possible to travel between the Cape and Rhodesia by train.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{forewings}} is 5 mm {{for males}} and 5.8 mm for females. Adults have a forewing pattern that differs from any other described species in the Hyposmocoma genus. It consists of a wide pale yellow band along <b>the</b> anal margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewing, curving proximally at the wing margin towards the costa. There is a small, round, dark brown mark present approximately two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from <b>the</b> wing base to the apex.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{nameplate}} was authenticated, historians {{could only}} {{speculate on the}} route Leichhardt had taken and how far he had journeyed before perishing. <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate indicated that he made it at least two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> across <b>the</b> continent during his east-west crossing attempt. It also suggested that he was following a northern arc from Moreton Bay in Queensland to the Swan River in Western Australia, following <b>the</b> headwaters <b>of</b> rivers, rather than heading straight through the desert interior.|$|R
50|$|The MM {{program for}} young {{professionals}} with limited professional experience often resembles {{one of a}} distance-learning, part-time, accelerated, or two-year MBA program. It typically prepares students to handle management issues in all areas <b>of</b> business with <b>the</b> option to concentrate or specialize in one area. Most programs begin {{with a set of}} required courses and then offer more specialized courses two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through <b>the</b> program.
