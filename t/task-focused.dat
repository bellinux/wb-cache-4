5000|$|The first {{description}} of the <b>task-focused</b> interface concepts appeared in a 2005 AOSD conference publication. The first implementation of the <b>task-focused</b> interface started as an open source project called Eclipse Mylyn, created in March 2005. The technology evolved with input and contributions from thousands of open source community developers. In 2006, a research group and the University of Victoria demonstrated {{the utility of the}} <b>task-focused</b> interface and degree-of-interest model for ontology visualization. In 2007, the Mylyn implementation was bundled with the majority of Eclipse IDE distributions. In 2008, alternate implementations of <b>task-focused</b> interface became available, including NetBeans Cubeon, and the Tasktop Pro tool for project managers. By 2009, most agile software development and application lifecycle management tools provided integration with Mylyn. [...] In 2011 NBTaskFocus got introduced which provided Mylyn like <b>task-focused</b> features in NetBeans IDE.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} psychological capital and well-being {{in a sample of}} 1, 502 teachers. Teaching has been consistently identified {{as one of the most}} stressful occupations, a situation that inherently raises questions about teacher wellbeing. This study explores the extent to which psychological capital can act as a protective factor against stress and also examines the role of appraisal and coping in the stress-strain relationship. Teachers across New Zealand and from a range of teaching levels completed surveys measuring psychological capital, challenge and threat appraisal, <b>task-focussed</b> and emotion-focussed coping, affect, perceived stress, and life satisfaction. Data analysis identified direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on outcome measures of wellbeing and stress. Teachers with higher levels of psychological capital reported higher levels of well-being and lower levels of stress. Psychological capital was positively related to life satisfaction (r =. 47, p <. 01) and positive affect (r =. 63, p <. 01), and negatively related to perceived stress (r = -. 66, p <. 01) and negative affect (r = -. 61, p <. 01). In addition, psychological capital was a significant predictor of outcome measures. Psychological capital was also positively related to challenge appraisal and <b>task-focussed</b> coping, and negatively related to threat appraisal and emotion-focussed coping. <b>Task-focussed</b> coping was found to mediate the relationship between challenge appraisal and measures of well-being. Teachers high in psychological capital were more likely to appraise a situation as a challenge than a threat, and as a partial mediator, <b>task-focussed</b> coping explained some of the relationship between challenge appraisal and well-being...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{students}} in clerkship are continuously confronted with real and relevant patient problems. To support clinical problem solving skills, students perform a Critical Appraisal of a Topic (CAT) task, often {{resulting in a}} paper. Because such a paper may contain errors, students could profit from discussion with peers, leading to paper revision. Active peer discussion by a Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environment show positive medical students perceptions on subjective knowledge improvement. High students’ activity during discussions in a CSCL environment demonstrated higher <b>task-focussed</b> discussion reflecting higher levels of knowledge construction. However, it remains unclear whether high discussion activity influences students’ decisions revise their CAT paper. The aim {{of this research is}} to examine whether students who revise their critical appraisal papers after discussion in a CSCL environment show more <b>task-focussed</b> activity and discuss more intensively on critical appraisal topics than students who do not revise their papers. Methods Forty-seven medical students, stratified in subgroups, participated in a structured asynchronous online discussion of individual written CAT papers on self-selected clinical problems. The discussion was structured by three critical appraisal topics. After the discussion, the students could revise their paper. For analysis purposes, all students’ postings were blinded and analysed by the investigator, unaware of students characteristics and whether or not the paper was revised. Postings were counted and analysed by an independent rater, Postings were assigned into outside activity, non-task-focussed activity or <b>task-focussed</b> activity. Additionally, postings were assigned to one of the three critical appraisal topics. Analysis results were compared by revised and unrevised papers. Results Twenty-four papers (51. 6 %) were revised after the online discussion. The discussions of the revised papers showed significantly higher numbers of postings, more <b>task-focussed</b> activities, and more postings about the two critical appraisal topics: “appraisal of the selected article(s) ”, and “relevant conclusion regarding the clinical problem”. Conclusion A CSCL environment can support medical {{students in}} the execution and critical appraisal of authentic tasks in the clinical workplace. Revision of CAT papers appears to be related to discussions activity, more specifically reflecting high <b>task-focussed</b> activity of critical appraisal topics. </p...|$|R
40|$|People tend {{to adopt}} ‘coping strategies’ {{when faced with}} {{environmental}} stressors. These coping strategies can be broadly categorised as either ‘emotion-focussed’ or ‘task-focused’ coping, depending on whether individuals focus on modifying their emotions or the situation to reduce stress. This study sought to explore the potential role of trait Emotional Intelligence in the prediction of adaptive coping strategies. It was hypothesised that Emotional Intelligence would predict adaptive emotion focussed coping, {{over and above the}} effects of age, gender and the Big Five. No relationship was hypothesised between Emotional Intelligence and <b>task-focussed</b> coping. Results were based on data from 145 students participating in an online task involving several questionnaires and a difficult problem designed to induce task-stress.

5000|$|The <b>task-focused</b> {{interface}} {{is a type}} of {{user interface}} which extends the desktop metaphor of the graphical user interface to make tasks, not files and folders, the primary unit of interaction. Instead of showing entire hierarchies of information, such as a tree of documents, a <b>task-focused</b> interface shows the subset of the tree that is relevant to the task-at-hand. This addresses the problem of information overload when dealing with large hierarchies, such as those in software systems or large sets of documents. The <b>task-focused</b> interface is composed of a mechanism which allows the user to specify the task being worked on and to switch between active tasks, a model of the task context such as a degree-of-interest (DOI) ranking, a focusing mechanism to filter or highlight the relevant documents. The <b>task-focused</b> interface has been validated with statistically significant increases to knowledge worker productivity. It has been broadly adopted by programmers and is {{a key part of the}} Eclipse integrated development environment.

For all tasks that have been integrated, Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand. It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information. Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, Redmine, Mantis, JIRA, Unfuddle, and GitHub.|$|E
40|$|Coping is an {{important}} aspect of operator stress: people use various strategies for dealing with potentially stressful task demands. This paper outlines two studies of a new instrument designed for human factors applications, the Coping Inventory for Task Stress (CITS). Factor analysis of coping items differentiated three aspects of coping specified by stress theory: <b>task-focus,</b> emotion-focus and avoidance. Patterns of coping appear to reflect both task demands and individual differences in perceptions of workload. Relationships between coping and other stress-related variables were investigated in a study of subjects who performed a rapid visual information processing task. <b>Task-focus</b> and avoidance were sensitive to experimentally-manipulated task factors: time pressure and negative feedback. Coping also related to personality factors, {{as well as to the}} external pressures of the task. At a practical level, assessment of coping may contribute to understanding of how operators cope effectively or ineffectively with a variety of task-related stressors, leading to a more informed choice of countermeasures for stress. A key insight concerning stress and performance is that operators actively regulate their handling of tas...|$|R

After performance, half {{of the children in}} each condition were given success feedback and the other half failure feedback. Attributions for performance were then obtained. In the success condition, children judged effort {{to be the most important}} cause of their performance, whereas children in the failure condition attributed their performance mostly to the difficulty of the task and their inability to remember the story. Older children in the self-focus condition attributed success more to internal causes than did older children in the <b>task-focus</b> condition.

40|$|International audienceDebating in {{educational}} situations can {{enable students to}} gain {{deeper understanding of the}} views that are being discussed, to acquire new arguments and ideas, and to form more reasonable personal opinions. However, analysing such subtle forms of interactive knowledge restructuring remains a problem for collaborative learning research. In this paper we present a framework for analysing how and when students broaden and deepen their understanding of a space of debate. The framework is termed “Rainbow” since it comprises seven principal analytical categories, to each of which a colour is assigned, thus enabling data-visualisation in marked-up interaction corpora. The categories distinguish between activities {{that are part of the}} prescribed assignment and activities that are not, and between <b>task-focussed</b> and non <b>task-focussed</b> activities. Activities focussed on maintaining the interaction itself are distinguished from argumentative interaction. Notably, an operational definition of what it means to broaden and deepen understanding in this case is also provided here. The functional Rainbow analysis is complemented by an analysis of topics and subtopics that enables identification of one form of conceptual deepening of the question. We propose that the Rainbow framework satisfies criteria of simplicity, coherence and coverage as an analytical method, which makes it suitable for extension to other educational situations. Possible extensions to the framework are discussed, with respect to additional CSCL tools, domains and tasks...|$|R

The tasks contained new vocabulary items and two locative structures, and were both learning treatments and on-line comprehension measures. Pre- and post tests included two vocabulary recognition tests and a sentence verification test. The hypothesis that negotiated interaction facilitates comprehension was supported (p<. 05), but that for premodified input was not. No main effect for treatment was found for posttest gains in lexis and morphosyntax, though significant gains (p<. 05) were found overall.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of neuropsychological functioning and coping styles on perceived stress in people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls (HC). Thirty-four minimally treated FEP patients from the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne, Australia, and 26 HC participants from a similar demographic area participated in the study. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery as well as the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (task-, emotion- and avoidance-focussed coping styles) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

40|$|IntroductionThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore differences {{in the implementation of}} case management among local breast cancer screening partnerships in New York State after changes in federal public policy in 1998 and to achieve a better understanding of case management in a new and distinct practice setting. Capacity and willingness to implement change were theorized to explain local differences in implementation. Local breast cancer screening programs that received federal funding through the New York State Department of Health were {{invited to participate in the}} study. MethodsA mail survey was administered to the directors of New York’s 53 local breast cancer screening partnerships in 2003. The survey included questions about willingness and capacity to implement case management and a scale to assess case management program philosophy. Factor analysis and correlations were used to compare willingness and capacity with differences in implementation. ResultsTwo common factors — task focus and self-identity focus — were identified as factors that differentiated case management programs. <b>Task-focus</b> partnerships undertook a broader range of tasks but were less likely to report autonomy in making program changes. Self-identity partnerships were less likely to report difficulties with other agencies and scored highly on innovation, involvement in work, and interest in client service. Having a nurse as the case manager, being aware of the standards of case management, and providing health education were associated with both task focus and self-identity focus. ConclusionThe study identified distinct styles of implementation. These styles have implications for the breadth of services provided, such as whether client-level services only are offered.

The {{objectives}} were to describe the culture in a DID and highlight the current workplace cultural issues that face DRs, to explore how people learn to become a DR and how they become professionally socialised, and to observe and describe how DRs communicate and interact within the DID. Method An ethnographic approach was used and participant observation was carried out for a four month period in a DID in the East of England. Semi-structured interviews with ten key informants were carried out to explore further the issues uncovered by the observation. Results The data was analysed using thematic analysis and four overarching concepts were identified. Relationships with patients Relationships with colleagues Structure and environment Characterising the role of the DR DRs exhibit resistance to change; and ambivalence to research, continuing professional development (CPD) and evidence-based-practice. Domination by the medical profession remains and affects the culture. DRs continue to conform to accepted behaviour; this is passed on through role modelling. They make a rapid assessment of patients in order to deal with them; theytend not to become involved with patients emotionally; exercising professional detachment. Team working evidently plays an important role in the DID. Conclusion The results of this study help to describe the complex nature of the culture in the DID. The DID is a <b>task-focussed</b> environment where efficiency is important, as a result patient care and quality of service may suffer. DRs need to be more pro-active in promoting and developing their profession.

40|$|Escalating {{tertiary}} fees, user pay systems, {{and high}} living costs {{are some of}} the reasons students are combining paid work with study. In tertiary institutions there are a large proportion of students studying while working. Working students of all ages have home commitments, be it household management, family, pet, or flatmate responsibilities. The aim of this research was to look at how working students manage interrole conflicts between work, study, and home. This included how interrole conflicts, satisfaction, and coping related to one another and whether <b>task-focussed</b> coping and emotion-focussed coping mediated and moderated the interrole conflict and satisfaction relationships. Three hundred and twenty seven students who had been undertaking paid work during the semester completed an online survey. Results showed that although there were some mediational and moderational relationships, overall coping made little difference to the relationships between interrole conflict and satisfaction. It was found that the domain that gave rise to interrole conflict was also the domain where most dissatisfaction was experienced, suggesting the source of the conflict is more resented than the role affected by the conflict. The highest conflict was time-based study interfering with home, and the second highest conflict was time-based work interfering with study. Tertiary institutions need to extend hours for their services, and evening and weekend availability of lecturing staff. Ongoing promotion through seminars of ways to successfully manage home commitments with study commitments would be useful for working students as well. It is also important that workplaces promote initiatives such as flexible hours to help students combine work and study successfully. Postgraduates experienced interrole conflict more than undergraduates in 5 of the 6 interrole conflicts so it is important that they are specially targeted for attention. Future research might like to compare larger samples of postgraduates and undergraduates and see if each group experiences similar or different mediational or moderational effects such as coping. Future research should also continue to differentiate between time and strain-based interrole conflict as working students experience them differently...|$|R

The images represent {{the current state}} of Christchurch; a city struggling to recover from devastating earthquakes that peaked in February, 2011, killing 185 people, injuring hundreds more and causing widespread and massive damage to infrastructure, land and building in the region. Crowdsourcing was used to gather a series of positive and negative photos from greater Christchurch to be employed in the subsequent experiment. Seventy-one Christchurch resident participants (51 women, 20 men) then took part in a vigilance task with the sourced images embedded to assess possible cognitive disruptions. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: embedded positive pictures, embedded negative pictures, or embedded scrambled image controls. Task performance was assessed with signal detection theory metrics of sensitivity A’ and β’’. Individuals viewing the positive images, relating to progress, rebuild, or aesthetic aspects within the city, were overall more conservative or less willing to respond than those in the other conditions. In addition, positive condition individuals reported lower task focus, when compared to those in the control condition. However, indicators of cerebral activity (fNIRS) did not differ significantly between the experimental groups. These results combined, suggest that mind wandering events may be being generated when exposed to positive post-earthquake images. This finding fits with recent research which indicates that mind-wandering or day dreaming tends to be positive and future oriented. While positive recovery images may initiate internal thoughts, this could actually prove problematic in contexts in which external attention is required. While the actual environment, of course, needs to recover, support agencies may want to be careful with employing positive recovery imagery in contexts where people actually should be paying attention to something else, like operating a vehicle or machinery...|$|R
