25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networks}} are, in many cases, a good {{tool for}} avoiding costly market research. They are the shortest, fastest and most direct {{way to reach}} an audience through a person who, in that specific community, has more credibility than anyone. For example, an athlete ‘delivers’ to their sponsor a consumer base {{of millions of people}} who every day are interested in what <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> they feel, what they consume. No need to go to a Nikeshop window to see Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest boots. He sells them for you directly via a Tweet.|$|E
25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the Syrian {{response}} to the attacks, Eitan said: [...] "The first reaction of the Syrians when we attacked their missiles was to scramble their air forces... any [...] who crossed an imaginary line {{in the direction of}} our forces was destroyed, shot down. The imaginary line was actually the range of the missile batteries in Syria proper. The basic tactic of the Syrian air force is to take to the air and to cross this imaginary line, which brings them outside the protective range of their home-based missiles. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they can, then run back for cover." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{is a broad}} {{practical}} bent to {{both the}} Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to Programming Perl begins: [...] "Perl is a language for getting your job done." [...] One consequence {{of this is that}} Perl is not a tidy language. It includes many features, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Because of the forgiving nature of the compiler, bugs can sometimes be hard to find. Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, [...] "In general, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you want, unless you want consistency." ...|$|E
500|$|On Memorial Day {{weekend in}} 2006, Cher called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal {{endorsing}} Operation Helmet, {{a group that}} provides helmets to help soldiers avoid head injuries while in the war zone. On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 December 2012, Delta Air Lines {{confirmed}} {{the purchase of}} Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic for £224 million, with future plans to develop a transatlantic joint venture. Regulatory approval from the United States and European Union was granted on 20 June 2013, and the purchase was completed on 24 June. In December 2012, International Airlines Group CEO, Willie Walsh, suggested that the loss-making company would be history within five years. [...] "I can't see Delta wanting to operate the Virgin brand because if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> {{does that say about}} the Delta brand?

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a [...] "romantic adventurist occupation". To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than {{a job in the}} scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of [...] "who archaeologists are, why <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted". The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.|$|E

2500|$|Trump and Kiyosaki {{conclude}} {{the book by}} embracing the phenomenon of entrepreneurs created through immigration to the United States. Trump and Kiyosaki write, that {{for hundreds of years}} immigrants came through Ellis Island seeking economic opportunities. The conclusion emphasizes the hardship some immigrants have experienced prior to arrival in the U.S., acknowledging many faced human rights abuses in their prior home countries and sought to maintain a better life for their families as Americans. Trump and Kiyosaki assert immigrants to the U.S. are motivated to find economic success, [...] "Many first generation immigrants are willing to pay any price, take any job, shoulder any burden if there is a chance it will give them a foothold, a start. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> must be done, for they have come for the opportunity to build the life of their dreams, to give their children something that they themselves never had. And for that, there is no price too steep, no challenge too great, no burden too heavy." ...|$|E
