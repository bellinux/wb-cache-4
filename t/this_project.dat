The main purpose of these materials is to address and correct the problem of students' alternate conceptions regarding kinematics. The identification of the students' alternate conceptions {{is the first step}} in correcting them. Tremendous amounts of educational research have been dedicated to the identification of students' alternate conceptions, and subsequently researchers have successfully identified many of them. The curriculum materials in <b>this</b> creative <b>project</b> are specifically designed to correct these identified alternate conceptions. The first chapter of <b>this</b> creative <b>project</b> gives an overview of the curriculum materials developed for <b>this</b> creative <b>project,</b> and the second chapter is a review of the current research regarding students' alternate conceptions.
