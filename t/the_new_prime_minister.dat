5|$|In June 1996, Solidarity Electoral Action (Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność) {{was founded}} as a {{coalition}} of over 30 parties, uniting liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic forces. As the public became disillusioned with the SLD and its allies, AWS was victorious in the 1997 parliamentary elections. Jerzy Buzek became <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Burston for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September 1945, {{along with}} Frank Berryman, James Cannan, John Northcott, Jack Stevens and George Wootten. The recommendation {{was turned down}} by the Labor government as it was not Labor Party policy to award knighthoods at this time. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Robert Menzies, again requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Burston was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (military division) in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, regional autonomy and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 general election, Labour {{defeated}} the Conservatives {{by a landslide}} to end their 18-year exile from government, and when Tony Blair, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> announced his ministerial team on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history. The Prime Minister's website highlights some achievements from Brown's decade as Chancellor: making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the G8 summit in 2005.|$|E
40|$|Since 1992, British {{governments have}} {{routinely}} published lists of cabinet committees.

25|$|It was {{not till}} April 1827, when the premiership, vacant through the {{paralysis}} of Lord Liverpool, fell to Canning, the chief advocate of Roman Catholic emancipation, that Lord Eldon, in the seventy-sixth {{year of his}} age, finally resigned the chancellorship in protest, being deeply opposed to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister's</b> more liberal principles.|$|R
5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam and his {{advisers}} did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E
5|$|Later, the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi {{commented that}} the Soviet attack, without a {{declaration}} of war, violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Finnish government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1972, Holt's {{government}} was voted {{out as the}} Labor Party took the majority in Canberra. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> was Gough Whitlam and new postmaster-general was Doug McClelland. In early 1973, {{in an effort to}} foster a more independent organisation, Madgwick asked Whitlam if the ABC's employees could be removed from the Public Service Board, which administered the Commonwealth government employment system. Although Whitlam had supported the idea in the past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did not act on Madgwick's request.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Mulroney's ministers {{had little}} {{government}} experience, resulting in {{conflicts of interest}} and embarrassing scandals.

5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent {{since the death of}} Alexander, retired and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister,</b> Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent for about a month until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{repeatedly}} {{sought a}} post with Allied forces fighting against France, but {{was sent to}} the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to join with the Prussians and Swedes and attack the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Grenville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell, and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesia Party {{remained}} in power until September 1933, when, despite narrowly topping the popular vote, it lost the month's election, winning only {{nine of the}} 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party to begin 28 years of uninterrupted stewardship.|$|E

Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E

It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Winston Field {{appointed}} Van der Byl as {{a junior}} government whip, and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service. Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly liberal in South African politics, he became identified with {{the right wing of}} the party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Ian Smith, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information. At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called Ivor Benson, who also served as press censor.

5|$|In this programme, by {{presidential decree}} Sudirman {{was no longer}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the military starting on 2January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma {{was intended to be}} commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister,</b> Mohammad Hatta, worked to implement the rationalisation programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as a rallying point and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general.|$|E
