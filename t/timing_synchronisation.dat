40|$|Abstract-Wireless OFDM signals {{typically}} have a cyclicprefixed guard interval. The FFT <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> at the receiver is traditionally {{based on the}} peak point of the correlation output between the guard interval and its corresponding duplicate at the OFDM symbol’s tail. This approach does not in general find the optimum timing position for the FFT when the channel contains more than one path. This is particularly true when the first arriving replica of the signal is not the strongest, potentially resulting in the timing position that is outside the acceptable range, causing ISI. In this paper, the OFDM FFT <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> problem under multi-path channel conditions are studied. Algorithms that produce improved FFT <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> are developed, which exploit either the channel information obtained, say, through scattered pilots or the characteristics exhibited by combining a modified correlation scheme with a special filtering process. Results from simulation study are presented which have shown a noticeable performance improvement...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete synchronisation scheme of a baseband OFDM receiver for the currently designed 4 G mobile communication system. Since the OFDM transmission {{is vulnerable to}} time and frequency offsets, accurate estimation of these parameters {{is one of the}} most important tasks of the OFDM receiver. In this paper, the design of a single OFDM synchronisation pilot symbol is introduced. The pilot is used for coarse timing offset and fractional frequency offset estimation. However, it can be applied for fine <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and integer frequency offset estimation algorithms as well. A new timing metric that improves the performance of the coarse <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is presented. Time domain synchronisation is completed after receiving this single OFDM pilot symbol. During the tracking phase, carrier frequency and sampling frequency offsets are tracked and corrected by means of the nondata-aided algorithm developed by the author. The proposed concept was tested by means of computer simulations, where the OFDM signal was transmitted over a multipath Rayleigh fading channel characterised by the WINNER channel models with Doppler shift and additive white Gaussian noise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} use of finite abstractions to study the finite-horizon {{probabilistic}} invariance problem over Stochastic Max-Plus-Linear (SMPL) systems. SMPL systems are probabilistic extensions of discrete-event MPL systems that are widely employed in the engi-neering practice for <b>timing</b> and <b>synchronisation</b> studies. We construct finite abstractions by re-formulating the SMPL system as a discrete-time Markov process, then tailoring formal abstraction techniques in the literature to generate a finite-state Markov Chain (MC), together with precise guarantees {{on the level of}} the introduced approximation. This finally allows to probabilistically model check the obtained MC against the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance specification. The approach is practically implemented via a dedicated software, and elucidated in this work over numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|Otrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) system {{performance}} remains acceptable under <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> errors {{as long as}} the start of each symbol is determined to lie within a certain length into the Cyclie Prefix (CP). The Schmidl and Cox Algorithm (SCA) is quite robust in estimating the timing and frequency offset synchronisation for systems with large OFDM symbol lengths. It uses two OFDM symbols for training with the first one having two identical halves. The start of the frame is estimated by correlating a received sequence of samples equal to half the OFDM symbol length with the following received samples. The effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) in the estimation process is mitigated only if the number of samples used in the correlation, and hence the OFDM symbol size is large. However to be successfully applied to Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA) systems, OFDM should perform well even with smaller symbol lengths. In this paper we present the Iterative Symbol Offset Correction Algorithm (ISOCA), which uses the SCA for initial coarse <b>timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and follows it with a two stage symbol offset correction algorithm by tracking the phase of the second training symbol.

30|$|The {{literature}} defines {{two types}} of video summaries, namely those based on key-frames and those comprised of video skims [7]. A video summary based on key-frames {{is made up of}} a set of relevant frames selected from the video shots obtained from the original video. This type of summary is static, since the key-frames, being temporally distant and non-uniformly distributed, do not enable adequate rendering/reproduction of the original temporal evolution of the video content. Here, the video content is displayed in a quick and compact way for browsing and navigation purposes, without complying with <b>timing</b> or <b>synchronisation</b> requirements. Video skims are usually built by extracting the most relevant temporal segments (with or without audio) from the source sequence. After the extraction, all temporal segments are concatenated into sequential video with much shorter length than the source sequence. The methods used for computation of key-frames and video skims summaries are quite distinct, but these {{two types of}} representations for video content can be transformed from one to the other. A video skim can be generated from a key-frame summary by adding frames or segments that include the key-frames, while a key-frame summary can be created from a video skim by uniform sampling or selecting the most representative frame from each video skim segment [4].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — OFDM is {{commonly}} known as a lowcomplexity scheme to cope with frequency-selective channels. However, a major obstacle for reliable data-transmission is constituted by rapidly fading channels. This is due to fast fading leading to a loss of orthogonality among neighboring subcarriers giving rise to intercarrier interference. A possible approach to alleviate channel estimation is the use of a linear antenna array at the receiver, which allows for computing virtual non-moving antennas by linearly combining the antenna signals. <b>Timing</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is crucial in this setting. A correct timing basis is required to have the output of the linear combination lead to an effectively time-invariant channel. A novel, robust timing approach is presented which takes into account all antenna signals and which exploits the cyclic prefix ’ redundancy without introducing additional training overhead. That same approach is also shown to be applicable with advantage to estimate receiver-side frequency offsets. I...|$|E
