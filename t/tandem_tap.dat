Recently, a <b>tandem</b> affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> method has been developed as a tool that allows rapid purification of native protein complexes expressed at their natural level in engineered yeast cells. To adapt this method to mammalian cells, we have created a TAP tag retroviral expression vector to allow stable expression of the TAP tagged protein at close to physiological levels.
