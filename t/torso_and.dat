5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> limbs. The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, <b>torso,</b> <b>and</b> other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E

5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often the seductive nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> buttocks. Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in his left hand and the trishula (trident) in his right hand.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner <b>torso,</b> <b>and</b> a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes {{embedded in the}} skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three rows of these along {{each side of the}} torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two rows of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four rows of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Daspletosaurus torosus (CMN 8506) is a partial skeleton including the skull, the shoulder, a forelimb, the pelvis, a femur {{and all of}} the vertebrae from the neck, <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> hip, as well as the first eleven tail vertebrae. It was discovered in 1921 near Steveville, Alberta, by Charles Mortram Sternberg, who thought it was a new species of Gorgosaurus. It was not until 1970 that the specimen was fully described by Dale Russell, who made it the type of a new genus, Daspletosaurus, from the Greek δασπλής (dasples, stem and connective vowel resulting in daspleto~) ("frightful") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"). The type species is Daspletosaurus torosus, the specific name torosus being Latin for 'muscular' or 'brawny'. Aside from the type, there is only one other well-known specimen, RTMP 2001.36.1, a relatively complete skeleton discovered in 2001. Both specimens were recovered from the Oldman Formation in the Judith River Group of Alberta. The Oldman Formation was deposited during the middle Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, from about 77 to 76 Ma (million years ago). A specimen from the younger Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta has been reassigned to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E
