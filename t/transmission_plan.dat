40|$|Before the {{deregulation}} of the electric industry, a vertically integrated utility made planning decisions for both the generation system and the transmission system according to reliability criteria. The {{deregulation of the}} electric industry has resulted in an unbundling of the long-term planning function for generation and transmission systems. In the deregulated world, <b>transmission</b> <b>planning</b> {{is different from that}} in the regulated environment. In this study, we present a market-based <b>transmission</b> expansion <b>planning</b> model and compare it with a traditional reliability-based <b>transmission</b> <b>planning</b> model. Reliability-based <b>transmission</b> <b>planning</b> tries to install new lines at minimal cost while fulfilling system reliability criteria. Market-based <b>transmission</b> <b>planning,</b> on the other hand, seeks investment opportunities so that network expansions can generate more economic benefits than the costs. Benders decomposition technique is employed in both methods, and their master problems and slave problems are compared, respectively. The scalability of the market-based <b>transmission</b> <b>planning</b> algorithm is also discussed. Various uncertainties occur in the planning process. Uncertainties appearing in the planning process are analyzed systematically and classified into random and non-random uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to simulate random uncertainties, while robustness testing method is employed to incorporate non-random uncertainties. Most planning optimization tools optimize generation expansion plans under an assumed <b>transmission</b> expansion <b>plan,</b> or they optimize <b>transmission</b> expansion <b>plans</b> under an assumed generation expansion plan.

This paper studies how traffic load of network coding based multicast (NCM) is disseminated in a communications network, with load balancing considered as an important factor. To this end, a hybridized estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed, where two novel schemes are integrated into the population based incremental learning (PBIL) framework to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, thus enhance the efficiency of the stochastic search. The first scheme is a bi-probability-vector coevolution scheme, where two probability vectors (PVs) evolve independently with periodical individual migration. This scheme can diversify the population and improve the global exploration in the search. The second scheme is a local search heuristic. It is based on the problem-specific domain knowledge and improves the NCM <b>transmission</b> <b>plan</b> at the expense of additional computational time. The heuristic can be utilized either as a local search operator to enhance the local exploitation during the evolutionary process, or as a follow-up operator to improve the best-so-far solutions found after the evolution.

In this context, this paper presents a novel methodology to solve the transmission expansion planning (TEP) problem under generation expansion uncertainty in a min-max regret fashion, when considering flexible network options and n 1 security criterion. To do so, we propose a five-level mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based model that comprises: (i) the optimal network investment plan (including phase shifters), (ii) the realization of generation expansion, (iii) the co-optimization of energy and reserves given transmission and generation expansions, (iv) the realization of system outages, and (v) the decision on optimal post-contingency corrective control. In order to solve the fivelevel model, we present a cutting plane algorithm that ultimately identifies the optimal min-max regret flexible <b>transmission</b> <b>plan</b> in {{a finite number of}} steps. The numerical studies carried out demonstrate: (a) the significant benefits associated with flexible network investment options to hedge transmission expansion plans against generation expansion uncertainty and system outages, (b) strategic planning-under-uncertainty uncovers the full benefit of flexible options which may remain undetected under deterministic, perfect information, methods and (c) the computational scalability of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the modern power system and the deregulation of the electric power industry have introduced more challenges to transmission network planners. In a large-scale power system, {{it is almost impossible}} to manually identify candidate expansion routes from thousands of possible transmission routes. On the other hand, searching the whole route space can be time-consuming and sometimes infeasible. Another significant challenge encountered by transmission planners is the increasing uncertainty involved in the planning process, which is the consequence of market deregulation. To meet the above challenges, a novel approach to transmission expansion planning (TEP) is proposed in this paper. A novel algorithm is developed to identify the transmission routes that are highly relevant to the system stability. These transmission routes will be selected as the candidate routes in the planning process, so as to significantly reduce the search space. A time series model based on advanced regression techniques is proposed to estimate the random uncertainties in the planning process. The non-random uncertainties, on the other hand, are modelled by constructing a series of future scenarios.
