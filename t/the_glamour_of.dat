At {{the top of the}} hierarchy of theaters was the Théâtre Français (today the Comédie-Française), at the Palais-Royal. Only classic French plays were performed there. Tickets ranged in price from 6.60 francs in the first row of boxes down to 1.80 francs for a seat in the upper gallery. Evening dress was required for the premieres of plays. At {{the other end of the}} Palais-Royal the Théâtre Montansier, which specialized in vaudeville and comedy.

500|$|As {{with another}} Prabhupada-inspired track {{that he wrote}} during this period, [...] "Living in the Material World", Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – {{particularly}} {{in the music industry}} – is meaningless. In the second verse of [...] "The Lord Loves the One", he sings: [...] "We all fool around, with objectives in mind / To become rich or famous, with our reputations signed..." [...] While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras, Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: [...] "Intoxicated, deluded by <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> riches, the childish do not see that they must pass away.

500|$|The drama Bus Stop was {{the first}} film that Monroe chose to make under the new contract; the movie was {{released}} in August 1956.

For the role, she learnt an Ozark accent, chose costumes and make-up that lacked <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult.

Melody Maker disagreed when in 1981 they said [...] "the Bunnymen are continuing to play majestic, uplifting music that will shine through the dark days ahead of us". In the 2002 book Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, author Chris Adams said that in 1995 McCulloch had said, [...] "That spikey edge [...] still stands up."

[...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays {{the reality of}} the protagonist's {{experience}} in an expressionistic style, <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood is portrayed more objectively. In reversing these conventional expectations, however, the film invites the viewer to interpret this version of Hollywood as merely [...] "the material of dreams" [...] and [...] "an unreal paradise of cruelty and failure", according to Taves. Scenes on the streets of Hollywood are filmed with a wildly moving camera from tilted angles, and edited into rapid juxtapositions, to reflect the false and excessive nature of the Hollywood film industry. The protagonist's ascension to heaven {{at the end of the}} film serves simultaneously as a fitting conclusion to the story, and as a satire of Hollywood's desire for traditional happy endings. As he ascends, heaven is located in the opposite direction from Hollywood, another jab at the industry. James wrote that the vision of heaven as an escape from the film industry's brutality [...] "figures the avant-garde's recurrent utopian aspirations".|$|E

The album that she recorded was later shelved, catalyzing her to pivot her focus. Instead, she began work in community service, and for the next five years, worked at homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation centers. She was quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "The only passionate people I met in New York, were social workers." [...] A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by David Kahne. With the label, she released the three-track EP, Kill Kill, in October 2008 and a full-length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010. After hearing Del Rey's demo, Kahne contacted her; she obliged, knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop. Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey: [...] "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue".|$|E

The website's consensus reads, [...] "Just because Fame is a well-acted musical doesn't mean it flinches against its surprisingly heavy topics." [...] Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, [...] "When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it's often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on." [...] Variety magazine wrote, [...] "The great strength {{of the film is}} in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, [...] "Fame is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being a teen-ager as well as Breaking Away did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu." [...] William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, [...] "Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining. You come away from it with all your preconceptions about <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> showbusiness wiped away and you can't help but admire the characters who get through." ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a pretty face during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger than she is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger than she is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E
