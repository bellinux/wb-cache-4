25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out and I do Saul.|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} The Line of Best Fit ranked [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] at number 6 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Tracks of 2013 and wrote that it was [...] "easily {{one of the most}} vital pop songs of the year". Rolling Stone ranked the {{recording}} at number 23 on their list of the 50 Best songs of 2014 and compared the song's production to that of Lorde's music and the lyrics to those of Kesha's songs. Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press deemed it {{as one of the best}} singles of that year and stated that [...] "it was refreshing to hear the debauchery depicted" [...] in the song. Echoing this thought, Chris DeVille of Stereogum ranked the track at number 26 on his list of Top 50 Pop Songs of 2014 and confessed that: [...] "For a song that derives much of its appeal from being out-of-control and over-the-top, 'Habits' is a work of extreme poise and precision from a pop songwriter with a blindingly bright future." [...] Entertainment Weekly 's Miles Raymer selected the line [...] "I eat my dinner in my bathtub / <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to sex clubs / Watching freaky people gettin' it on" [...] on his list of the best lyrics of 2014 and wrote that it was [...] "one of the most interesting images to come out of a pop singer's mouth this year".|$|E
5000|$|Rumi says:I {{looked for}} God. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a temple, and I didn't find him there. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a church, and I didn't find him there. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And <b>then</b> finally <b>I</b> looked in my heart, {{and there he}} was.|$|R
60|$|I nodded, {{and whispered}} good-night. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> home, heavily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just that,--and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> off rather {{suddenly}} {{to the other}} side of the country; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had to <b>go</b> up to London. Now I'm going to Patagonia." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ralph Hattersley, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's, marries Milicent because he wants a quiet wife who will let him do what he likes with no word of reproach or complaint. He mistreats his wife. [...] "I {{sometimes}} think she has no feeling at all; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on until she cries – and that satisfies me," [...] he tells Helen. But after he reforms himself he becomes a loving husband and father.|$|E
2500|$|Abbott {{has spoken}} out against {{concerns}} such as voter fraud, {{the right to}} bear arms, and President Barack Obama's health care reform. When asked what his job entails, Abbott says: [...] "I go into the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> home." [...] Abbott has filed suit against various U.S. agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (including challenges to Obamacare), and the Department of Education, among many others.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into Griffin's to hae {{my boots}} hobbed, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to Riggs's batty-cake shop, and asked 'em for a penneth of the {{cheapest}} and nicest stales, {{that were all}} but blue-mouldy, but not quite. And whilst I was chawing 'em down I walked on and seed a clock with a face {{as big as a}} baking trendle--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hands the}} money back to Major Tucker; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> over to Colonel Rockingham and slaps him on the back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vell, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> because <b>I</b> {{was sent}} for, an' wot d'ye think? the old gen'l'man hoffered me the sitivation of under-gardener!" ...|$|R
60|$|A week hence I {{start for}} the Island of Kauai, to be gone three weeks and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back to California.|$|E
6000|$|What shall it be, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to see, then, Under the plea, then, [...] Of votary? I'll go to Lakeland, Lakeland, Lakeland, Certainly Lakeland [...] Let it be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I {{think they}} are right; that is, if they can afford time. I can't afford time. I'm here every day till five, Mr Gresham; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out and dine in Fleet Street, {{and then back to}} work till nine." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{to help to}} set the leg of {{the injured}} man, which was all the rest I got that morning.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the prophetess, and she {{conceived}} and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, “Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz; ...|$|R
60|$|I sat awake {{long after}} dark, but finally my eyes grew heavy and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{to sleep on}} the bench until morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on {{setting up}} the boat's mast. I didn't care much for the notion of {{butchering}} a man bound hand and foot and fastened by the neck besides. I had a knife then--the honourable Antonio's knife; and that knife is this knife.|$|E
6000|$|He used to say: [...] "People think I {{make a lot}} {{of money}} in this {{schooner}} of mine. But that is nothing. I don't care for that. Now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> away quietly and lift a bar of silver. I must get rich slowly--you understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{have agreed}} I shall keep watch here to-night, Boston to-morrow night, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on again. Zeke {{will take the}} watch below regular; he sleeps like a dog, and the least noise {{in the world will}} wake him, so he will do very well. Can you make out the Indian village across there from here?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{got into}} the barn unperceived, and I watched him climb the ladder to the loft. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> indoors to tell them.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{and told}} Marie what I had promised. Somewhat to my {{surprise}} {{she said that she}} thought I had acted wisely.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{into the}} next place. This was of a rough crude exterior, but the inside was {{comparatively}} pretentious, and ablaze with lights.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's the point. Now and then, I think I see; but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> {{off on a}} wrong tack: I get a silly fit, and {{a hopeless}} one, and lose my clue. And yet, after all, there is a highway; and wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,' murmured Louis, as he gazed on the first star of evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] she said, [...] "they are of {{the same}} length. Now, without the wind blows gently; come then {{to the door of}} the tent, and I will throw these two hairs into the wind. If that which is black floats first to the ground, then I stay, if that which is golden, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to seek my hair. Is it agreed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I didn't I would starve," [...] responded Johnny Chuck promptly. [...] "When it gets near {{time for}} Jack Frost to arrive, I stuff and stuff and {{stuff on the}} last of the good green things until I'm so fat I can hardly waddle. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> down to my bedroom, curl up and go to sleep. Cold weather, snow and ice don't worry me a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> away. <b>I</b> {{would have}} stayed the night at this house: I wanted to. But I had {{developed}} my Austrian character too far.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they all}} feel you're rather big, anyhow. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on to Park Lane {{to hear a}} new pianist and some other music at Eva's." ...|$|R
60|$|I got 'ome {{at about}} a quarter to seven, and slept like a child till pretty near four. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> downstairs to 'ave my dinner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{accounts}} of the Snake Dance contained mention of [...] "Black Mose," [...] who kept a band of toughs from interfering with the dance. His wonderful marksmanship was spoken of. He did not write till he reached Flagstaff. His letter was very brief. [...] "I'm going into the Grand Cañon for a few days, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> {{to work on a}} ranch south of here for the winter. In the spring I'm going over the range into California." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely; but I didn't {{attend to}} it. When the day's work is done, I take my walk. Then I have my supper, my drop of grog, and my pipe. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to bed. A dull {{existence}} you think, I daresay! I had a miserable life, sir, when I was young. A bare subsistence, {{and a little}} rest, before the last perfect rest in the grave--that is all I want. The world has gone by me long ago. So much the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wait, and you'll see. An' don't {{get scared}} at the start. The first few rounds'll be {{something}} fierce. That's Ponta's strong point. He's a wild man, with an kinds of punches,--a whirlwind,--and {{he gets his}} man in the first rounds. He's put away {{a whole lot of}} cleverer and better men than him. It's up to me to live through it, that's all. Then he'll be all in. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> after him, just watch. You'll know when I go after him, an' I'll get'm, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stone and Toddy,--with {{a little}} tobacco, {{have been all}} my comfort. I began, however, by {{sleeping}} for a few hours. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> upon the mountains." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to my pretty rose tree,To tend her {{by day and}} by night;But my rose {{turned away}} with jealousy,And her thorns were my only delight.|$|R
6000|$|I {{paused to}} observe the effect of my words. It was excellent, for both Marama and the priest wrung their hands and groaned. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on: ...|$|R
