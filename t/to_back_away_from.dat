25|$|The tit-for-tat {{inability}} of either side <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> conflict, {{for fear of}} being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the source of many conflicts throughout history.|$|E
25|$|The {{plane had}} trouble leaving the gate when the ground {{services}} tow motor {{could not get}} traction on the ice. For approximately 30 to 90 seconds, the crew attempted <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the gate using the reverse thrust of the engines, which proved futile. Boeing operations bulletins had warned against using reverse thrust in those kinds of conditions.|$|E
25|$|On stardate 1512.2, the Federation {{starship}} USS Enterprise, {{commanded by}} Captain James T. Kirk, finishes a {{third day of}} star mapping when novice navigator Lt. Dave Bailey (Anthony Call) spots a large spinning colored cube floating in space. First Officer Spock orders Helmsman Sulu to sound an alert. Chief Engineer Scott cannot explain how the cube works. A nervous and inexperienced Bailey advocates attacking it with phasers. Kirk instead orders the ship <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the object. The cube comes even closer and emits harmful radiation and Kirk reluctantly destroys it.|$|E
60|$|With a low, angry yelp he turned, {{standing}} motionless a few seconds, {{during which}} time Jet continued <b>to</b> <b>back</b> farther <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the house in order {{that there might be}} less chance the noise of the conflict would be overheard.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2013 she {{publicly}} confronted Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar in {{the conference}} hall of Yemen's National Dialogue Conference: Ahmar seemed <b>to</b> be <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> appointing feminist Nabila al-Zubair {{as chair of the}} body deciding the future of the disputed city of Sa'dah until Basha gave him this [...] "public flaying".|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{laughed at}} this, {{but in a}} minute Jonas called to him <b>to</b> stand <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the bank; and then, after a few strokes more, {{the top of the}} tree began to bend slowly over, and then it fell faster and faster, until it came down with a great crash, {{directly}} across the brook.|$|R
25|$|The growing {{power of}} Wei caused Zhao <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the alliance. In 383 it moved its capital to Handan and {{attacked}} the small state of Wey. Wey appealed to Wei which attacked Zhao {{on the western}} side. Being in danger, Zhao called in Chu. As usual, Chu used this as a pretext to annex territory to its north, but the diversion allowed Zhao to occupy a part of Wei. This conflict {{marked the end of}} the power of the united Jins and the beginning a period of shifting alliances and wars on several fronts.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 The Guardian {{characterized}} {{the game as}} [...] "The last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco, Grim Fandango is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees, its limited sales prompted LucasArts <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> original adventures to simply exploit franchises." ...|$|E
500|$|If disturbed, {{they will}} hiss loudly and continuously, {{adopting}} a tightly coiled defensive posture with the fore {{part of their}} body held in a taut [...] "S" [...] shape. At the same time, they may attempt <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the threat towards cover. They may strike suddenly and fast, to the side as easily as forwards, before returning quickly to the defensive position, ready to strike again. During a strike, {{the force of the}} impact is so strong, and the long fangs penetrate so deeply, that prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone. The fangs apparently can penetrate soft leather.|$|E
60|$|Just at this time, Beechnut's head {{appeared}} {{coming up}} the ladder. He called upon the boys <b>to</b> come <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the hen, while {{he went up to}} see. She was upon a nest there, squatted down very low, and with her wings spread wide as if trying to cover a great nest full of eggs.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{identity}} {{therapy was}} designed by Warren Throckmorton and Mark Yarhouse, and was endorsed by Robert L. Spitzer, prior <b>to</b> Spitzer's <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this belief that he had proven reparative therapy at times successful. Its purpose is to help patients line up their sexual identity with their beliefs and values. Therapy involves four phases: (1) assessment, (2) advanced or expanded informed consent, (3) psychotherapy, and (4) social integration of a valued sexual identity.|$|R
60|$|Kit looked about, {{but could}} not see the launch. The dark mass was a thick belt of trees, but he did not know, and did not think Mayne knew, where they were, and the easy motion {{indicated}} that the tide was carrying the steamer on. Much to his relief, the indistinct wall of forest seemed <b>to</b> bend <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sea. It looked as if they were entering the lagoon; and then he heard the telegraph and the rattle of rudder chains.|$|R
500|$|Rohrer later {{transferred}} {{the themes of}} Deception onto a framework around corporate espionage and the blood diamond trade. Though not particularly concerned about blood diamonds, and wary of the game being perceived as a finger-wagging exercise, {{he felt that the}} setting would give an [...] "extra oomph to the game's seedy mechanics". Instead of being an overt protest against the blood diamond trade, the game would explore the psychology of the industry through its game mechanics, causing players to reflect after a game on their decisions made within it. Majesco greenlit this, and in July 2009, a publishing contract was signed. Rohrer began work on Diamond Trust of London as a pen and paper prototype to iron out the design before committing to code. By December, the game was in a fully playable state, lacking only the soundtrack and tutorial. Majesco, however, decided <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a physical cartridge release, and pushed instead for a DSiWare download version. Rohrer disagreed, believing that the smaller DSiWare market would limit the game's audience; Majesco, on the other hand, was not willing to invest in the manufacturing of cartridges without strong pre-order numbers. The company made the game available to GameStop to gauge pre-order interest, stating that 3,000pre-orders would be necessary for a cartridge release. [...] Diamond Trust generated only 23pre-orders, and in 2010, the Majesco agreement was terminated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} David Brion Davis {{states that}} {{in the years after}} 1785 and Jefferson's return from Paris, the most notable thing about his position on slavery was his [...] "immense silence." [...] Davis and other historians believe that, in addition to having internal conflicts about slavery, Jefferson wanted to keep his personal situation private; for this reason, he chose <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> working to end or ameliorate slavery.|$|E
2500|$|In effect, {{the suburbs}} would receive an {{additional}} seat to reflect their rapid population growth. Democratic state chairman, Otis B.

2500|$|Five level sensors in {{the bottom}} of each S-II {{propellant}} tank were armed during S-II flight, allowing any two to trigger S-II cutoff and staging when they were uncovered.

50|$|Desmond left Kit Carson {{and owned}} a {{restaurant}} in Golden, Colorado, then later a saloon in Georgetown, Colorado. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work for the railroad, and by 1872 he had married and settled in Pueblo, Colorado. Not long afterward he began working as a deputy for the Pueblo County, Colorado Sheriffs Office. He quickly developed a dangerous reputation, due mostly to his tendency <b>to</b> never <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a fight. Those who remembered him often indicated that he almost welcomed a fight. This also led to his having a reputation for police brutality.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} developed {{more options}} of value {{for this type}} of instrument than others. However, a 2005 study reported that some of the risks related to longevity are poorly managed [...] "practically everywhere" [...] due <b>to</b> governments <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> defined benefit promises and insurance companies being reluctant to sell genuine life annuities because of fears that life expectancy will go up. Longevity insurance is now becoming more common in the UK and the U.S. (see Future of annuites, below) while Chile, in comparison to the U.S., has had a very large life annuity market for 20 years.|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 1953, the {{committee}} battled for 90 minutes over the appointment, with McCarthy refusing <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Matthews and {{claiming that he}} was a [...] "non-professional" [...] member of the staff that could be hired or fired at his sole discretion, while the Democratic minority cited the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which placed the hiring and firing of committee staff within the purview of the majority of {{the committee}}.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Cardinal and the Indian Chiefs of Alberta {{responded with}} a {{document}} entitled [...] "Citizens Plus" [...] but {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Red Paper". In it, they explained Status Indians' widespread opposition to Chrétien's proposal. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the Liberals began <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the 1969 White Paper, particularly after the Calder case decision in 1973. [...] After the Canadian Supreme Court recognized that indigenous rights and treaty rights were not extinguished, a process was begun to resolve land claims and treaty rights and is ongoing today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{infomercial}} for the 80-minute tape included {{footage of}} Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist {{who claimed to}} be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities. The silhouetted journalist was subsequently revealed to be Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government. [...] "Obviously, I'm not an investigative reporter", Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist Murray Waas. Later, Falwell seemed <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary The Hunting of the President, Falwell admitted, [...] "to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in The Clinton Chronicles." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{pendulum}} began <b>to</b> swing <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> consolidation {{toward the}} formation of smaller boutique firms with the downturn {{of the economy in}} late 2008 and early 2009 as recession-proof niche practices began to separate themselves from the struggling behemoths. For example, Washington, D.C.-based Hautsfeld LLP spun out of Cohen Milstein and Birmingham, Alabama-based Frohsin & Barger, LLC spun out of the southern regional firm Baker Donelson. Both Hausfeld and Frohsin & Barger have been cited as examples by the National Law Journal as [...] "somewhat recession-proof" [...] boutiques. [...] Other boutiques, such as Waesche, Sheinbaum & O'Regan, have dissolved.|$|R
60|$|Terror, hot terror, {{began to}} play about Byrne’s heart like a tongue of flame that touches and withdraws before it turns a thing <b>to</b> ashes. He <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the body {{as far as he}} could, then came forward stealthily casting fearful glances to steal another look at the bruised forehead. There would perhaps be such a faint bruise on his own forehead—before the morning.|$|R
60|$|Brayton rose to {{his feet}} and {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>back</b> softly <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the snake, without disturbing it if possible, and through the door. Men retire so from the presence of the great, for greatness is power and power is a menace. He knew that he could walk backward without error. Should the monster follow, the taste which had plastered the walls with paintings had consistently supplied a rack of murderous Oriental weapons from which he could snatch one to suit the occasion. In the mean time the snake's eyes burned with a more pitiless malevolence than before.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese {{government}} of the National Islamic Front had begun <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its previous hard-line stance. [...] This was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the National Islamic Front government. [...] U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan. [...] Over the next several years, Khartoum {{is believed to have}} substantially curtailed aid to the LRA. In 1999 the Carter Center mediated the Nairobi Agreement between Uganda and Sudan, which restored diplomatic relations in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis led Richard Posner, a prominent judge, University of Chicago law professor, and innovator {{in the field}} of Law and Economics, <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the hypothesis and express some degree of belief in Keynesian economics. Posner accused some of his Chicago School colleagues of being [...] "asleep at the switch", saying that [...] "the movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience—the self healing powers—of laissez-faire capitalism." [...] Others, such as Fama, said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession, not the cause of it. Despite this, Fama has conceded that [...] "poorly informed investors could theoretically lead the market astray" [...] and that stock prices could become [...] "somewhat irrational" [...] as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The other seven {{opposition}} premiers were startled: Campaigning {{against the}} protection of rights was generally seen as political suicide, and a national referendum {{could be seen as}} [...] "conventionalizing" [...] the charter without the need for provincial approval. Further, Canadians nationwide were mostly in agreement with Trudeau on the issue and were tired of the constant constitutional talks; [...] The draft text of the Federal proposal was later revealed to involve the approval of Trudeau's reforms, with referendums being only if provinces representing 80% of the population demanded them within the two years. This prompted Lévesque <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the referendum proposal, saying it looked as though it was [...] "written in Chinese." [...] The conference descended again into acrimony, with Trudeau and Lévesque angrily clashing over language rights. Trudeau announced that he would attend one final meeting at 9am the following day and head to Westminster if agreement was not reached. Peckford announced that Newfoundland would forward a proposal the next day. Lévesque and the Quebec delegation went to sleep in Hull, Quebec, for the night.|$|E
5000|$|Bataan fell on 9 April, and—rather than {{surrender}} <b>to</b> the enemy—Canopus <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the dock}} and sank {{at the hands of}} her own crew. That night, Pigeon made rendezvous with fleet submarine [...] under the enemy guns in the south channel off Corregidor. Snapper had brought 46 ST of food and stores for beleaguered Corregidor and Pigeon hurried to load the cargo before the start of night bombing raids.|$|R
50|$|By {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, the trend began <b>to</b> move <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the {{pre-recorded}} sketch shows of the '80s and '90s. Comedy talk shows such as TV Total and Elton.tv naturally involved more off-the-cuff humour, and soon these were joined by improvised shows such as Genial daneben and the original Schillerstraße. The main role in the latter is played by an actress, Cordula Stratmann; by now there were several shows whose main stars were female comedians, such as Ladykracher with Anke Engelke. Slapstick now played a less important role: instead, realism was in, with shows removing the laugh track, such as Stromberg (similar to The Office) or the sitcom Pastewka.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{document}} entitled Sharing value added to property on the VFT corridor, the consortium suggested {{that part of}} the cost of the VFT could be offset by the government levying a capital gains style tax on property within the development corridor; the resulting backlash from farmers and other landowners caused the consortium <b>to</b> quickly <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the suggestion. Similarly, some opponents of the VFT seized on a remark by Abeles that [...] "land value capture" [...] could be used to fund the project through its difficult early years, and began to publicly suggest that the VFT was in fact a [...] "disguised real-estate project" [...] rather than a genuine desire to provide a transport service.|$|R
2500|$|Hitler {{called a}} truce in the Church {{conflict}} with the outbreak of war, wanting <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> policies likely to cause internal friction in Germany. He decreed {{at the outset of}} war that [...] "no further action should be taken against the Evangelical and Catholic Churches {{for the duration of the}} war". According to John Conway, [...] "The Nazis had to reckon with the fact that, despite all Rosenberg's efforts, only 5 per cent of the population registered themselves at the 1930 census as no longer connected with Christian Churches." [...] The support of millions of German Christians was needed in order for Hitler's plans to come to fruition. It was Hitler's belief that if religion is a help, [...] "it can only be an advantage". Most of the 3 million Nazi Party members [...] "still paid the Church taxes" [...] and considered themselves Christians. Regardless, a number of Nazi radicals in the hierarchy determined that the Church Struggle should be continued. Following victory in Poland, the repression of the Churches was extended, despite their early protestations of loyalty to the cause.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012, as Minister, Toews {{introduced}} the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act (also known as Bill C-30). The bill, which {{made no mention}} of children or [...] "Internet predators" [...] outside of its title, would have granted police agencies expanded powers, mandate that internet service providers (ISPs) provide subscriber information without a warrant and compel providers to reveal information transmitted over their networks with a warrant. When criticised about privacy concerns, Toews responded that people [...] "can either stand with us or with the child pornographers." [...] Public response followed, with an anonymous Twitter account posting personal information of Toews' court proceedings during his divorce, and around this time Conservative support appeared <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the bill and open up to amendments. Toews later denied that he had made the [...] "child pornographers" [...] reference, despite his comments being available in Hansard and on video. In February 2013 the government announced Bill C-30 would be scrapped entirely in favor of changes in Canada's warrant-less wiretap law. [...] Vic Toews resigned from his position on July 8, 2013 and retired from politics.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Ranjitsinhji {{began to}} work with Daniel Hayward, a {{first-class}} cricketer {{and the father of}} future England batsman Thomas Hayward, on his batting technique. His main fault was a tendency <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ball when facing a fast bowler, making it more likely he would be dismissed. Possibly prompted by the suggestion of a professional cricketer who was bowling at him in the nets at Cambridge, he and Hayward began to practise with Ranjitsinhji's right leg tied to the ground. This affected his future batting technique and contributed to his creation of the leg glance, a shot with which he afterwards became associated. While practising, he continued to move his left leg, which was not tied, away from the ball; in this case, it moved to his right, towards point. He found he could then flick the ball behind his legs, a highly unorthodox shot and likely, for most players, to result in their dismissal. Although other players had probably played this shot before, [...] Ranjitsinhji was able to play it with unprecedented effectiveness. Ranjitsinhji probably developed his leg glance with Hayward around spring 1892, for during the remainder of that year, he scored around 2,000 runs in all cricket, far more than he had previously managed, making at least nine centuries, a feat he had never previously achieved in England.|$|E
5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little bearing on Wallhead, who was able to land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared <b>to</b> be <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Wallhead, who chased him down with punches and knees to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in the towel, resulting in a first-round TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|R
5000|$|Desperate Living is {{the only}} feature film Waters made without Divine prior to the actor's death in 1988. Divine had <b>to</b> reluctantly <b>back</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the film because he was {{committed}} to appearing in The Neon Woman. Susan Lowe, who had appeared in small or supporting roles in Waters' previous films, was chosen to take over {{for the role of}} Mole McHenry. This was also Waters' first film without David Lochary, the reason for which being Lochary's addiction to drugs. Waters said [...] "The reason that David wasn't in Desperate Living is because of PCP. That's all that's to it. I know that's why he wasn't in the film, and he knows it too." [...] Lochary would later die of a drug overdose during the film's production.|$|R
25|$|The ICU {{declared}} {{that it was}} not going to attack after the lapse of the one-week timeframe for Ethiopian withdrawal. Both sides seem <b>to</b> have <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a military confrontation at this time. Fifty more government troops were said to have defected in Gedo province and were now with the ICU in Bur Dhubo. TFG Premier Ali Mohammed Gedi raised the claim of foreign fighters present in Somalia to 5000. ICU commander Sheikh Ahmed Hassan Abuu Rayan stated he was positioning an unspecified number more militia troops along the border with Ethiopia in Far Libah town, Hiran region. ICU forces were also said to be approaching Bardhere in Gedo province near the Kenyan border. Colonel Abdulahi Sheik Fara-Tag was named as the commander of the TFG forces defending the town from attack.|$|R
