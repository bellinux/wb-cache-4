5|$|Dwarka is {{mentioned}} in the copper inscription dated 574AD of Simhaditya, the Maitraka dynasty minister of Vallabhi. He {{was the son of}} Varahdas, the king of Dwarka. The nearby Bet Dwarka island is a religious pilgrimage site and an important archaeological site of the Late Harappan period, with one <b>thermoluminescence</b> date of 1570BC.|$|E
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through <b>thermoluminescence</b> to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E
25|$|Ancient slag is {{difficult}} to date. It has no organic material with which to perform radiocarbon dating. There are no cultural artifacts like pottery shards in the slag with which to date it. Direct physical dating of slag through <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating {{could be a good}} method to solve this problem. <b>Thermoluminescence</b> dating is possible if the slag contains crystal elements such as quartz or feldspar. However, the complex composition of slag can make this technique difficult unless the crystal elements can be isolated.|$|E
25|$|Valladas et al. (1987) {{obtained}} a <b>thermoluminescence</b> age of 61-59,000 years for Kebara 2's layer, congruent with Schwarcz et al. (1989) who found {{an age of}} 64-60,000 years by electron spin resonance.|$|E

25|$|Extensive {{contacts}} through trade {{are recognized}} in foreign objects deposited in elite burials; stylistic influences on La Tène material culture can be recognized in Etruscan, Italic, Greek, Dacian and Scythian sources. Dateable Greek pottery and analysis employing scientific {{techniques such as}} dendrochronology and <b>thermoluminescence</b> help provide date ranges for an absolute chronology at some La Tène sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} {{inscriptions}} in Brāhmī are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka, {{dating to the}} 3rd century BCE. These were long considered the earliest examples of Brāhmī writing, but recent archaeological evidence in Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu suggest the dates for the earliest use of Brāhmī to be around the 6th century BCE, dated using radiocarbon and <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating methods.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, an {{electron}} spin resonance test conducted on bone fragments from LM3's skeleton established an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999 <b>Thermoluminescence</b> dating work was carried out on quartz from unburnt sediment associated with the LM3 burial site with the selective bleach results indicating a burial older than 24,600 ± 2,400 and younger than 43,300 ± 3,800 years ago.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{primitive}} hand-axes, as well {{as several}} kinds of scrapers and perforators, were excavated at the Jebel Faya archaeological site in the United Arab Emirates. These tools resemble the types used by early modern humans in East Africa. Through the technique of <b>Thermoluminescence</b> dating the artifacts were placed between 100,000 and 125,000 years old. This is the earliest evidence of modern humans found anywhere outside Africa and implies modern humans left Africa much earlier than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|After 1900 BCE, the {{systematic}} {{use of the}} symbols ended, following {{the final stage of}} the Mature Harappan civilization. A few Harappan signs have been claimed to appear until as late as around 1100 BCE (the beginning of the Iron Age in India). Onshore explorations near Bet Dwarka in Gujarat revealed the presence of late Indus seals depicting a 3-headed animal, earthen vessel inscribed in what is claimed to be a late Harappan script, and a large quantity of pottery. The <b>thermoluminescence</b> date for the pottery is 1528 BCE. This evidence has been used to claim that a late Harappan script was used until around 1500 BCE.|$|E
25|$|While {{evidence}} such as {{size and}} scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) is compelling, {{developments in the}} Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by 14C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still {{the most widely used}} absolute dating method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, <b>thermoluminescence),</b> are applied more widely, or Long Count-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.|$|E
500|$|For example, the uncalibrated date [...] "UtC-2020: 3510 ± 60 BP" [...] {{indicates}} that the sample was tested by the Utrecht van der Graaf Laboratorium, where it has a sample number of 2020, and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present, ± 60 years. Related forms are sometimes used: for example, [...] "10 ka BP" [...] means 10,000 radiocarbon years before present (i.e. 8,050 BC), and [...] yr BP {{might be used to}} distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as <b>thermoluminescence.</b>|$|E
500|$|Researchers {{have studied}} other {{radioactive}} isotopes created by cosmic rays {{to determine if}} they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest; such isotopes include , , , , and [...] [...] With the development of AMS in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques, which have been primarily applied to dating rocks. [...] Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods, as with potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating, and uranium series dating. [...] Other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include <b>thermoluminescence,</b> optically stimulated luminescence, electron spin resonance, and fission track dating, as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers, such as dendrochronology, tephrochronology, and varve chronology.|$|E
500|$|A {{year later}} Frankfort (1937) {{acknowledged}} Van Buren's examples, added {{some of his}} own and concluded [...] "that the relief is genuine". Opitz (1937) concurred with this opinion, but reasserted that the iconography is not consistent with other examples, especially regarding the rod-and-ring symbol. These symbols were the focus of a communication by Pauline Albenda (1970) who again questioned the relief's authenticity. Subsequently the British Museum performed <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating which was consistent with the relief being fired in antiquity; but the method is imprecise when samples of the surrounding soil are not available for estimation of background radiation levels. A rebuttal to Albenda by Curtis and Collon (1996) published the scientific analysis; the British Museum was sufficiently convinced of the relief to purchase it in 2003. The discourse continued however: in her extensive reanalysis of stylistic features, Albenda once again called the relief [...] "a pastiche of artistic features" [...] and [...] "continue to be unconvinced of its antiquity".|$|E
500|$|The {{curtain wall}} {{was not all}} built at once but was {{constructed}} in segments, {{as can be seen}} from vertical breaks in the stonework which mark where sections met. The wall is built on top of complex foundations constructed from rubble and timber set into a ditch [...] deep. Oak piles were driven into the trench and packed with flint and clay, above which a horizontal framework of oak beams was set with more flint and clay. The foundation was finally covered over with cement before the walls were built on top. Some of the timbers have survived, allowing archaeologists to date the fort through dendochronology. Other dating evidence was discredited in the 1970s. An excavation in 1906–08 found shattered tiles stamped HON AUG ANDRIA, which were used to attribute Pevensey Castle's construction to the reign of the early 5th century Emperor Honorius. However, the use of <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating revealed that the tiles had been made {{around the time of the}} excavation. It is suspected that Charles Dawson, who has been blamed for the Piltdown Man hoax, was the author of the forged tiles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} that the disc is a 1908 forgery or hoax has been raised by two scholars.

2500|$|Radiocarbon and <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating {{was carried}} out at the University of Salento in February 2007 to resolve the question. [...] The results {{revealed}} with an accuracy of 95.4 percent that the sculpture was crafted between the 11th and 12th century AD.|$|E
2500|$|Excavations at {{an ancient}} stone quarry (the Container Corporation of America site in Marion County) yielded [...] "crude stone implements" [...] {{showing signs of}} {{extensive}} wear from deposits below those holding Paleo-Indian artifacts. <b>Thermoluminescence</b> dating and weathering analysis independently gave dates of 26,000 to 28,000 years ago {{for the creation of}} the artifacts. The findings are controversial, and funding has not been available for follow-up studies.|$|E
2500|$|The age and {{origin of}} the Capitoline Wolf is a subject of controversy. [...] The statue was long thought to be an Etruscan work of the 5th century BC, with the twins added in the late 15th century AD, {{probably}} by the sculptor Antonio Pollaiolo. However, radiocarbon and <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating {{has found that the}} wolf portion of the statue was likely cast between 1021 and 1153.|$|E
2500|$|Qesem Cave was {{occupied}} from about 420-220 ka, {{although there is}} some uncertainty regarding the end date. All archaeological finds at Qesem Cave have been assigned to the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) of the late Lower Paleolithic. In 2003, 230Th/234U dating on speleothems established {{the beginning of the}} occupation as [...] "well before about 382,000 years ago." [...] Further research in 2010, 2013, and 2016, involved <b>thermoluminescence</b> dating (TL) on burnt flints and ESR/U-series (Electron spin resonance dating) on speleothems and herbivorous teeth.|$|E
2500|$|Today it is {{generally}} accepted by historians {{that there is no}} historic attestation connecting the Externsteine to the Irminsul. Certainly, the Eresburg was only about 45 kilometers (c.28 miles) from the Externsteine, and there indeed was an Irminsul [...] "near the Externsteine", but extensive archaeological studies of the Externsteine have failed to yield any material evidence for their use as a sacred site between Mesolithic and pre-Christian times. <b>Thermoluminescence</b> dating of firesites suggests that the site was occasionally used as a rock shelter in Saxon times, but apparently not to the extent one would expect from a major place of worship.|$|E
