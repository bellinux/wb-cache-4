25|$|Work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent. <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline,</b> {{construction was}} carried out around the clock. Equipping the plants involved its own challenges. As soon as specifications were drawn up for certain items, the design group would place orders for them. Some facilities had to be fabricated for the purpose. Some items were hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them {{for use by the}} Manhattan Project and took possession of them as they came off the assembly line. The molds, which needed to be surrounded by cooling water coils, proved difficult to fabricate, and went through several design changes. The melting kettles required stainless steel mixing blades, cooling jackets and tilting supports. Since each held enough high explosive to level a building, they were operated remotely, behind thick concrete walls.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, {{the three}} teams would face-off in a rematch, with Gas Monkey Garage (featured on the Discovery Channel show Fast N' Loud) {{also in the}} competition.

Gas Monkey Garage was especially upset, eventually leading to heated confrontations with James at the live build-off results show on December 12.|$|R

25|$|Like the {{previous}} two Witcher games, players are given a complex story with multiple choices and consequences. Unlike other game engines, REDengine 3 permits a complex storyline without sacrificing virtual world design. The user interface was made more intuitive with grid-based solutions. The camera system was improved to use long shots for battles with multiple enemies and close-ups for more-intimate confrontations. More animations were used for combat sequences than in The Witcher 2, with each lasting less than one second for quick succession. Game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and senior game designer Damien Monnier cited Dark Souls and Demon's Souls as influences on Wild Hunt combat system, and level designer Miles Tost and senior environment artist Jonas Mattsson cited The Legend of Zelda series and Red Dead Redemption as influencing the game's level designs and environments. Months before its release date, the game's economy, crafting, and inventory systems were incomplete and apparently unable <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline.</b> Senior gameplay designer Matthew Steinke thought of a remedy and drew up a system context diagram. To allocate prices, Steinke wrote a formula based on rate of damage, defence, or healing. Polynomial least squares {{were used to determine}} its efficacy, and it was found to eliminate bugs from the system and reduce loading times.|$|E

Rubin thought it impossible <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline</b> and all involved ended up working long hours with no days off in order to complete the record. West had intended the album be 16 tracks until Rubin suggested cutting the album down to fewer tracks. Rubin gave as example [...] "Bound", which was [...] "a more {{middle of the road}} R song, done in an adult contemporary style" [...] before Kanye decided to replace the musical backing with a minimalistic sample, [...] "a single note bassline in the hook which we processed to have a punk edge in the Suicide tradition." [...] Two days before the album had to be delivered to the label, West wrote and sung lyrics to two songs while also recording the vocals to three others in just two hours. Rubin also suggested to reduce the album from sixteen songs to just ten, saying the others could be reserved for a follow-up.|$|E

[...] They had kept in touch, and {{were involved in}} several real estate dealings together. But the Nuggets deal was problematic from the start. [...] In fact, it almost fell through because Lee {{did not have the}} resources everyone, Bynoe among them, thought he had. [...] Media reports depicted Lee as a wealthy and successful businessman who was a financier with offices in two cities, and formerly part owner of Boston's WNEV-TV. [...] But Lee and Bynoe were unable <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline</b> to purchase the team from then-owner Sidney Shlenker. [...] It would later be revealed that Lee had problems raising the needed capital. [...] It was Bynoe, with the assistance of David Stern, Jay Pritzker, and Jerrold Wexler, who salvaged the transaction over the course of six months. The mainstream media reported that Lee and Bynoe were now the first two blacks to own a major sports team, but several of the black newspapers pointed out that the two men were actually managing general partners rather than owners, because the revised agreement to purchase the team meant they owned only a 37.5% stake in the team. Bynoe sold his interest in the franchise in August 1992. Communications Satellite Corporation's (COMSAT) Video Enterprises subsidiary put up 62.5% of the $65 million needed to purchase the Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|Ravenloft's success led to {{a sequel}} in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill. Although Tracy Hickman was {{credited}} in RavenloftII, he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline.</b> Clyde Caldwell, who had done all of the art for the original Ravenloft module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by Jeff Easley. The adventure is designed for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large color map and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that Gryphon Hill plays differently each time. The module's plot features an artifact known as The Apparatus that switches a monster's personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity {{of the people they}} meet. The module also introduces Azalin the lich, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original Ravenloft. It includes descriptions of the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all mapped in perspective like the original module.|$|E

A release date was announced for November 2002, but the game got delayed into spring 2003. Eidos believed The Angel of Darkness would benefit from additional marketing support from , the sequel to the [...] Despite the delays, the company pushed Core Design to release the game {{in time for the}} marketing support. In order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline,</b> areas of the game containing key narrative elements had to be cut; one of the losses was the explanation of how the character survived the events of The Last Revelation. Among other concepts that needed to be cut were two further locations, character animations, sound bites, and unique gameplay elements involving Kurtis. Some completed environmental assets also ended up being cut by mistake. Some of those elements were also deliberately left out by the team, who wished to bring them into future games. The team at Core Design later said that they felt Eidos forced them to get the game out before it was ready. The game was also reportedly submitted eight times to Sony before its release. The game went gold on 18 June 2003, two days before its original release date, although there was some confusion as the game had reportedly gone gold on 2 June. The game was finally released in the summer of 2003, alongside The Cradle of Life.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the console}} used 32-bit {{processing}} and {{was capable of}} better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did {{not take advantage of}} its hardware. Doom for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later noted for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, chuggy movement, and running within a window on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. [...] One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, [...] "We were rushed. [...] We had to get games out for the 32X and {{it was going to be}} such a close cycle. [...] When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didn't even want to ship it. [...] It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title." [...] Likewise with Doom, id Software's John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>deadline</b> for the port to be published on time. [...] Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: [...] "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered." ...|$|E
