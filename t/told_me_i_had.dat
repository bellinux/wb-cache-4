500|$|Burrell {{signed a}} one-day {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 19, 2012, so he could officially retire as a Phillie. It was announced on February 28, 2015 that Burrell will be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted on Friday, July 31. He stated, [...] "I always knew that the fans were behind me, even through the tough times. When David (Montgomery) called and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been voted in by the fans, it was overwhelming." [...] He was the 37th inductee to the Wall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|The “biggest” of {{the four}} soldiers, Sam {{is known for his}} child-like personality. He befriends a young Italian boy, Angelo Torancelli, and becomes a father figure to the child. Sam is first to {{discover}} a finely carved statue head, the Head of the Primavera, which he believes to carry magical powers. Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee. He fought hard to win the role of Sam, which resulted in him physically preparing for the part: “My physical prep was a little different than everybody else’s, because Spike wanted me for the movie, but he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to lose weight to do it. I had nine weeks to lose 60 pounds. We got it done.” ...|$|E
500|$|Fonda became {{interested}} in acting in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of The Country Girl, at the Omaha Community Playhouse. After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting {{changed the course of}} her life, Fonda saying, [...] "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> talent. Real talent. It {{was the first time that}} anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Constable <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{reason to}} believe that he doesn't sympathize with his wife in her {{attitude}} on this matter. It's pulled him down,--you've noticed that he looks badly?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "After they (the US military) {{gave me a}} blood {{transfusion}} after my suicide attempt, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been suffering from a strange condition,:"They carried out an examination of my blood and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> blood diseases and problems.|$|R
2500|$|Jennifer Judith Jones {{was born}} to Larry and Carol Jones who were both curlers. She also has a sister named Heather 18 months older. During her childhood, she was often {{described}} as [...] "shy". Larry Jones started teaching Jones when she was 11 although Jones' interest of the sport took up before that, in a daycare at the St. Vital Curling Club. She attended General Vanier School in South Winnipeg from kindergarten to grade 8. After, she attended Windsor Park Collegiate. At that point, Jones was proficient at Volleyball and Curling. [...] "When I {{was in high school}} I really had to make a choice and it was actually my volleyball coach who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to choose either volleyball or curling, and I chose curling." [...] she told the CBC. She later attended the University of Manitoba from 1999–2001.|$|E
2500|$|Two more {{exceptional}} runs {{took place}} at The Palace during the last decades of the 20th century: Jesus Christ Superstar (3,358 performances from 1972 to 1980) and Les Misérables, which played at the theatre for nineteen years after moving from the Barbican Centre on 4 December 1985. The production moved to the Queen's Theatre on April 2004 to continue its record-setting run. [...] In between, Song and Dance played from 1982 to 1984. [...] In 1983, Andrew Lloyd Webber purchased the theatre for £1.3 million and {{began a series of}} renovations to the auditorium, including uncovering the famous marble and onyx panels lurking below a layer of paint. [...] He restored the theatre's facade, later commenting: [...] "I removed the huge neon sign that defaced the glorious terracotta exterior, much to the chagrin of West End producers who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> removed the greatest theatre advertising sight in London." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was not my}} cause, John," [...] she said, smiling, [...] "and I {{received}} no other notification than what I got through Mrs Mackenzie. Indeed, as you know, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> regarded this law business as nonsense all through. Since what you and Mr Slow <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known that the property was yours." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As {{you said}} a moment ago," [...] he observed, [...] "the staff of Peaceful Moments is taking big risks. I knew it before you <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had {{practical}} demonstration of the fact. And that is why this Broster Street thing {{has got to be}} finished quick. We can't afford to wait. So I am going to have you tell me this man's name right now." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E

60|$|Benjamin {{looked down}} again at his plate, with a rueful {{resignation}} which <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> carried my point.|$|R
60|$|However, {{his opening}} remark <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{alarming}} myself unduly. It {{was of a}} pacific nature, and came as a great relief.|$|R
5000|$|A typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a cult following, {{at least}} I think that's what he said".|$|R
6000|$|... “Why, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better dig {{it all up}} first; but I thought that, if I planted part first, {{those things}} would be growing while I am digging {{up the rest of}} the ground.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am rather," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "In fact, {{a jeweler}} I once knew <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a natural gift in that direction. And so, of course, Sir Thomas was pretty {{grateful}} to your father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said, with a {{catch in}} his breath, [...] "you can't mean it, Carrie. In {{spite of what}} you <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been trying to believe the thing {{was out of the}} question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Don de Soto {{was against}} the murder? So his own {{grandson}} <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard of him only as a tyrant and a butcher." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know it," [...] I answered, [...] "till {{the end of}} the evening, {{and then}} Harry Verner <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> danced with him more than once if I'd known it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the time, Rachel," [...] I said, [...] "when you could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> offended you, in a worthier way than that. I beg your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{better come}} right in," [...] said Verena, looking {{now about the}} room, very glad to find herself in so {{pleasant}} a place, and noticing a great many things that she should {{like to see in}} detail.|$|E
60|$|I followed, {{but there}} was that within me that <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shot my bolt. The sun blazed down, concentrating its rays on {{my back to the}} {{exclusion}} of the surrounding scenery. It seemed to follow me about like a limelight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaving {{a sigh of}} relief, I {{turned and}} crossed into Randolph Street, and there a constable {{collared}} me. I was arguing with him when the first fool came up breathless. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better explain the matter to the Inspector, and I thought so too.|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain see me {{standing}} around, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> better <b>have</b> {{something to eat}} before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch, and give <b>me</b> all <b>I</b> wanted." ...|$|R
60|$|But when Hester {{returned}} {{and found out}} about Hugh she was very angry--and grieved, which hurt me far more. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgotten myself and that Hugh's visits must cease.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Schuyler did not wince; but {{the smile}} {{that was on}} her lips was absent from her eyes. [...] "You once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> him. Are you quite sure {{you would like to}} hand him over now?" ...|$|R
60|$|The ladies {{made all}} {{possible}} acknowledgment, {{and we had}} the honour that day to dine with them in public. My landlord, the Spaniard, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> given them such a present as the viceroy of Mexico's lady would have gone fifty leagues to have received.|$|E
60|$|Upon this {{rallying}} him, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> either perfectly {{studied the}} art of humour, or else what was the greatest difficulty to others was natural to me, adding that {{nothing could be more}} obliging to a man of honour than not to be soliciting and craving.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only went}} into the drawing-room," [...] she said, [...] "to look for this. It may remind you of your visit here, and of the friends you leave behind you. You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{improved}} very much when I did it, and I thought you might like----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I half feared as much." [...] Nevertheless, Alec did {{not object}} to that confession. He knew that {{anything}} was better then frigidity. [...] "Why haven't you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made you angry?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In her essay, Spillman {{wrote that}} [...] "I need one more cheap thrill, since my doctor <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> only <b>have</b> another 25 years left." [...] Among the other contestants were Richard Kneip, then the {{incumbent}} Governor of South Dakota.|$|R
