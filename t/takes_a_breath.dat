500|$|The Deluxe Complete Edition soundtrack was {{released}} on December 18, 2007. Depp's singing was described by a New York Times reviewer as [...] "harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful". Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is dead-on accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> and is poised to speak. Yet when he sings, his voice crackles and breaks with sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} composition [...] "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of Philip Glass’ music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song’s finale. [...] Parsons characterizes this same song as [...] "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> until {{near the end of}} the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, [...] "floating effortlessly" [...] on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme". At the same time, Debbage notes [...] "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." [...] and says that it [...] "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".|$|E

50|$|One {{objection}} {{that can}} be offered against Van Inwagen’s view is the vagueness of the category {{of life and the}} ambiguity of when something gets “caught up” in a life.

50|$|A subject <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of 100% {{oxygen and}} exhales through a one-way valve {{measuring}} nitrogen content and volume. A {{plot of the}} nitrogen concentration (as a % of total gas) vs. expired volume is obtained by increasing the nitrogen concentration from zero to the percentage of nitrogen in the alveoli. The nitrogen concentration is initially zero because the subject is exhaling the dead space oxygen they just breathed in (does not participate in alveolar exchange), and climbs as alveolar air mixes with the dead space air. The dead space can be determined from this curve by drawing a vertical line down the curve such that the areas below the curve (left of the line) and above the curve (right of the line) are equal.|$|E

Also in the video is Ure's future wife Annabel Giles. The music in the video stops halfway through where a seemingly exhausted Midge Ure, tired from minutes of endless running around has to sit down for a moment and take a breather. He rests for a moment then <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> before standing up recovered and continuing with the song at which point the music starts up once again.|$|E
