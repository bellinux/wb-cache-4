40|$|Background- The lethal {{isotherm}} for radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation {{of cardiac}} myocardium is widely accepted to be 50 oC {{but this has}} not been directly measured. The {{purpose of this study was}} to directly measure the tissue temperature at the edge of RF lesions in real time using infrared thermal imaging. Methods and Results- Fifteen radiofrequency lesions of 6 - 240 seconds in duration were applied to the left ventricular surface of isolated perfused pig hearts. At the end of RF delivery, a <b>thermal</b> <b>image</b> of the tissue surface was acquired with an infrared camera. The lesion was then stained and an <b>optical</b> <b>image</b> of the lesion was obtained. The <b>thermal</b> and <b>optical</b> <b>images</b> were electronically merged to allow determination of the tissue temperature at the edge of the lesion at the end of RF delivery. By adjusting the temperature overlay display to conform with the edge of the RF lesion, the lethal isotherm was measured to be 60. 6 oC (interquartile ranges 59. 7, 62. 4 oC, range 58. 1 – 64. 2 oC). The areas encompassed by the lesion border in the <b>optical</b> <b>image</b> and the lethal isotherm in the <b>thermal</b> <b>image</b> were statistically similar and highly correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0. 99, p 0. 64).

The areas encompassed by the lesion border in the <b>optical</b> <b>image</b> and the lethal isotherm in the <b>thermal</b> <b>image</b> were statistically similar and highly correlated (Spearman 0. 99, P 0. 001). The lethal isotherm temperature was not related to the duration of radiofrequency delivery or to lesion size (both P 0. 64). The areas circumscribed by 50 °C isotherms were significantly larger than the areas of the lesions on optical imaging (P 0. 002). Conclusions—By direct measurement, the lethal isotherm for cardiac myocardium is near 61 °C for radiofrequency energy deliveries 240 seconds in duration. A 50 °C isotherm overestimates lesion size.

5000|$|For the 5.45×39mm AK-74, the East German Zeiss ZFK 4×25, 1P29, Belorussian BelOMO PO 3.5×21P, PO 4×24P and the 1P78 Kashtan {{dedicated}} {{side rail}} mounted <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> were developed. These <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> are primarily designed for rapid target acquisition and first round hits out to 400 m, but by various means these <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> also offer bullet drop compensation (BDC) (sometimes {{referred to as}} ballistic elevation) for aiming at more distant targets. The BDC feature compensates for the effect of gravity on the bullet at given distances (referred to as [...] "bullet drop") in flat fire scenarios. The feature must be tuned for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of gun and cartridge at a predefined muzzle velocity and air density. Since the usage of standardized ammunition is an important prerequisite to match the BDC feature to the external ballistic behaviour of the employed projectiles, these military <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> are intended to assist with field shooting at varying medium to longer ranges rather than precise long range shots.|$|R

40|$|The present-day {{reliance}} on metadata in obtaining information from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> {{means that in}} the absence of metadata, estimating temperatures from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> would have to be done with user intervention, which is time-consuming when there are many <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> to consider.

To facilitate this research, <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> of various subjects are used as sample images to test the program. A method to estimate temperatures from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> without metadata and without the need for manual input has been developed, by making use of optical character recognition to have the program automatically read the temperature scales on <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> for the necessary information.
