At the end of the 1930s, the German company Telefunken tried to make a longwave <b>transmission</b> <b>experiment</b> with a captive helicopter driven with a three-phase, AC-power engine. The helicopter should have reached a height of 1000 metres. Because of electrostatic charges induced by earth's electric field, the fuses melted when the captive helicopter reached a height of 750 metres and the captive helicopter landed roughly.|$|E
50|$|On 9 September 1983, {{during the}} stay of Vladimir Lyakhov and Alexander Alexandrov, while reorienting {{the station to}} perform a {{radiowave}} <b>transmission</b> <b>experiment,</b> Lyakhov noticed the pressure of one fuel tank was almost zero. Following this, Alexandrov spotted a fuel leak looking through the aft porthole. Ground control {{decided to try to}} repair the damaged pipes, in what was to be the most complex repair attempted during EVA at the time. This was to be attempted by the next crew, the current one lacking the necessary training and tools. The damage was eventually repaired by Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov, who after four EVAs managed to fix two leaks but needed a special tool to fix the third. The tool was delivered by Soyuz T-12, and the leak was subsequently fixed.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between {{pathogens}} and hosts at {{the population}} level {{should be considered}} when studying the effectiveness of control measures for infectious diseases. The advantage of doing <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> compared to field studies is that they offer a controlled {{environment in which the}} effect of a single factor can be investigated, while variation due to other factors is minimized. This paper gives an overview of the biological and mathematical aspects, bottlenecks and solutions of developing and executing <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> with animals. Different methods of analysis and different experimental designs are discussed. Final size methods are often used for analysing transmission data, but have never been published in a refereed journal; therefore, they will be described in detail in this paper. We hope that this information is helpful for scientists who are considering performing <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding 'gain-of-function' experiments on high-consequence avian influenza viruses has highlighted {{the role of}} ferret <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> in studying the transmission potential of novel influenza strains. However, the mapping between influenza transmission in ferrets and in humans is unsubstantiated. We address this gap by compiling and analyzing 240 estimates of influenza transmission in ferrets and humans. We demonstrate that estimates of ferret secondary attack rate (SAR) explain 66 % {{of the variation in}} human SAR estimates at the subtype level. Further analysis shows that ferret <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> have potential to identify influenza viruses of concern for epidemic spread in humans, though small sample sizes and biological uncertainties prevent definitive classification of human transmissibility. Thus, ferret <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> provide valid predictions of pandemic potential of novel influenza strains, though results should continue to be corroborated by targeted virological and epidemiological research. 26329460 PMC 458639...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> {{are useful}} for {{investigating}} the mechanisms of low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza virus (LPNAI) transmission. In this study, the hypothesis that inoculation-infected chickens are more infectious than contact-infected chickens was tested. To this end, extended <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> with one H 5 N 2 and one H 7 N 1 LPAIV which had previously been characterized {{in a series of}} standard <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> were conducted in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. For the H 5 N 2 LPAIV, the infectivity of contact-infected chickens was similar to the infectivity of inoculated chickens. Despite results from a previous study suggesting the H 7 N 1 LPAIV strain to be similarly infectious to SPF chickens as the H 5 N 2 LPAIV strain, the acquisition of contact-infected chickens proved more difficult for H 7 N 1 LPAIV. It was assumed that this might have been a consequence of the length and timing of the exposure period. In conclusion, for LPNAIVs that first seemed equally infectious, short-term transmissibility may vary considerably...|$|R
40|$|Neutron <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> were {{performed}} on samples of an advanced nickel-chromium-molybdenum-gadolinium (Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd) neutron absorber alloy and chromium-nickel (Cr-Ni) stainless steel, modified {{by the addition of}} boron. The primary purpose of the experiments was to demonstrate the thermal neutron absorbing capability of the materials at specific gadolinium and boron dopant levels. The Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy is envisioned to be deployed for criticality control of highly enriched U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF). For these <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments,</b> test samples were fabricated with 0. 0, 1. 58 and 2. 1 wt% natural gadolinium dispersed in a Ni-Cr-Mo base alloy and 1. 16 wt% boron in stainless steel. The <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> were successfully carried out at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). Measured data from the neutron <b>transmission</b> <b>experiments</b> were compared to calculated results derived from a simple exponential transmission formula using total neutron cross sections. Excellent agreement between the measured and calculated results demonstrated the expected strong thermal absorption capability of the gadolinium and boron elements and in addition, verified the measured elemental composition of the Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy and borated stainless steel test samples. The good agreement also indirectly confirmed that the size and distribution of the gadolinium in both the hot-top (as-cast) and Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd converted to plate was not a discriminator related to neutron absorption. Moreover, the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF VII) total neutron cross section data were accurate...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{acidification}} of the drinking water of broiler chickens on both direct and indirect transmission of Campylobacter was evaluated. In the direct <b>transmission</b> <b>experiment</b> both susceptible and inoculated animals were housed together. In the indirect <b>transmission</b> <b>experiment</b> the susceptible animals were spatially separated from the inoculated animals and no direct animal to animal contact was possible. The transmission parameter ß was estimated for the groups supplied with acidified drinking water and for the control groups. The results showed that acidification of the drinking water {{had no effect on}} direct transmission (ß= 3. 7 day(- 1) for both control and treatment). Indirect transmission however was influenced by acidification of the drinking water. A significant decrease in transmission was observed (...|$|E
