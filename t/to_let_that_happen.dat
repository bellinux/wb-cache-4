25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity {{as an excuse for}} closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users were not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E
25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to be getting the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
60|$|To go {{into the}} other room would be to drop the conversation. I was {{determined}} not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> catastrophe <b>happen.</b> It was just possible that Mrs. Beauly's maid might have quitted her service, or might have been left behind in England. My information would not be complete until I knew what had become of the maid. I pushed my chair back a little from the fire-place, and took a hand-screen from a table near me; it might be made useful in hiding my face, if any more disappointments were in store for me.|$|R
5000|$|Wesley had {{a lifelong}} {{complicated}} {{relationship with her}} family and especially with her mother, who had a sharp tongue. Following {{the death of her}} father in 1961, her mother said: [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> lingering death <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me. When the time comes I'm going to crawl to the Solent and swim out." [...] Wesley replied with feeling: [...] "I'll help you".|$|R
50|$|At work, Buffy {{talks with}} Xander {{on the phone}} until a student, Amanda, comes in for counseling. The girl asks about liking a boy who picks on her and seeks Buffy's advice, but Buffy gets a bit distracted with her own similar {{situation}} with Spike and rambles about how she's not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> problem <b>happen</b> again. Buffy returns home to bickering amongst the Potential Slayers and news from Willow that another Potential Slayer has been found, already in Sunnydale. The Potentials examine weapons and Dawn tries {{to fit into the}} group's conversation, but it's a struggle. Spike arrives and then leaves with Buffy and the other girls for some training. Andrew pouts because he's not invited and although silent, Dawn feels left out as well.|$|R
6000|$|Please {{understand}} I do {{not consider}} this concentration of activity and these vast [...] "artificialisations" [...] {{of the human body}} as attractive or desirable things. At the first proposal much of this tampering with the natural stuff of life will strike anyone, I think, as ugly and horrible, just as seeing a little child, green-white and still under an anaesthetic, gripped my heart much more dreadfully than the sight of the same child actively bawling with pain. But the business {{of this paper is to}} discuss things that may happen, and not to evolve dreams of loveliness. Perhaps things of this kind will be manageable without dreadfulness. Perhaps man will come to such wisdom that neither the knife nor the drugs nor any of the powers which science thrusts into his hand will slay the beauty of life for him. Suppose we assume that he is not such a fool as <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen,</b> and that ultimately he will emerge triumphant with all these powers utilised and controlled.|$|E

50|$|Kitchener placed great {{importance}} on transport and communications. Reliance on river transport, and {{the vagaries of}} the Nile flooding, had reduced Garnet Wolseley's Nile Expedition to failure in 1885, and Kitchener was determined not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> again. This required the building of new railways to support his invasion forces.|$|E

5000|$|In 1916, Oishei {{was driving}} down Delaware Avenue near Virginia Street in {{downtown}} Buffalo during a rainstorm. A bicyclist {{ran into the}} National Roadster he was driving at the time. Oishei never saw him coming, {{and even though the}} cyclist was not seriously injured, Oishei vowed <b>to</b> never <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> again. He sought out the best technology available at the time to create the first automobile wiper blades and grew the idea from a simple fix to worldwide use. In 1917, John R. Oishei founded Trico Products Corporation [...] He looked around for a way to clear moisture from a driver's line of vision, and decided to invest in the national marketing of an edged, hand-pulled rubber squeegee that was produced in Buffalo by an engineer named John Jepson. Within three years, Oishei's sales team had successfully sold the accessory to Packard, Lincoln, Cadillac and Buffalo's own Pierce-Arrow.|$|R
500|$|While Disney {{executives}} {{had discussed}} closing Feature Animation as redundant, Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved {{to try to}} turn things around at the studio. Lasseter said [...] "we weren't going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> [...] <b>happen</b> on our watch. We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney's amazing studio and bring it back up to the creative level it had to be. Saving this heritage was squarely on our shoulders." [...] Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff, and rehired a number of its 1980s [...] "new guard" [...] generation of star animators who had left the studio, including Ron Clements, John Musker, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, Bruce W. Smith, and Chris Buck. To maintain the separation of Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management, Catmull and Lasseter [...] "drew a hard line" [...] that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and {{would not be allowed to}} borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. Catmull said that he and Lasseter [...] "make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other. We don’t want them to merge; that would definitely be the wrong approach. Each should have its own personality." ...|$|R

50|$|The Great Depression {{had been}} taking its toll on the NHL. At the {{beginning}} of the decade, there were ten teams. Since then, two teams folded and it looked like the New York Americans were to become the third team. The NHL, however, was not about <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> So, instead of letting the team fold because of money and ownership problems, the league assumed control of the team for the 1936-37 season. It was then that owner Bill Dwyer sued. A settlement then allowed for Dwyer to own the team, run by the NHL, and that Dwyer would be given a chance to pay back his debts.|$|E

6000|$|As {{he walked}} now after his {{unsuccessful}} quest of Dr. Brighton-Pomfrey towards the Serpentine he acted that stormy interview with Lady Sunderbund over again. At the end, {{as a condition}} indeed of his departure, he had left things open. He had assented to certain promises. He was to make her understand better what it was he needed. He was not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> anything <b>that</b> had <b>happened</b> affect <b>that</b> [...] "spi'tual f'enship." [...] She was to abandon all her plans, she was to begin again [...] "at the ve'y beginning." [...] But he knew that indeed {{there should be no}} more beginning again with her. He knew that quite beyond these questions of the organization of a purified religion, it was time their association ended. She had wept upon him; she had clasped both his hands at parting and prayed to be forgiven. She was drawing him closer to her by their very dissension. She had infected him with the softness of remorse; from being a bright and spirited person, she had converted herself into a warm and touching person. Her fine, bright black hair against his cheek and the clasp of her hand on his shoulder was now inextricably in the business. The perplexing, the astonishing thing in his situation was that there was still a reluctance to make a conclusive breach.|$|R
