5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling {{to hold on to}} their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b> Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937.

For various reasons, however, no other team was extended an offer. Throughout the 1990s, the Atlantic Coast Conference remained at nine members.
