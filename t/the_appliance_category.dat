40|$|International audienceMachine Learning (ML) {{approaches}} are increasingly used to model data coming from sensor networks. Typical ML implementations are cpu intensive {{and are often}} running server-side. However, IoT devices provide increasing cpu capabilities and some classes of ML algorithms are compatible with distribution and downward scalability. In this demonstration we explore the possibility of distributing ML tasks to IoT devices in the sensor network. We demonstrate a concrete scenario of appliance recognition where a smart plug provides electrical measures that are distributed to WiFi nodes running the ML algorithms. Each node estimates class-conditional probabilities that are then merged for recognizing <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> <b>category.</b> Finally, our architectures relies on Web technologies for complying with Web-of-Things paradigms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We asset {{about the}} {{analysis}} of electrical appliance consumption signatures for the identification task. We apply Hid-den Markov Models to appliance signatures for the identification of their category and of the most probable sequence of states. The electrical signatures are measured at low frequency (101 Hz) and are sourced from a specific database. We follow two predefined protocols for providing comparable results. Recovering informa-tion on the actual appliance state permits to potentially adopt energy saving measures, as switching off stand-by appliances or, generally speaking, changing their state. Moreover, {{in most of the}} cases appliance states are related to user activities: the user interaction usually involves a transition of the appliance state. Information about the state transition could be useful in Smart Home / Building Systems to reduce energy consumption and increase human comfort. We report the results of the classification tasks in terms of confusion matrices and accuracy rates. Finally, we present our application for a real-time data visualization and the recognition of <b>the</b> <b>appliance</b> <b>category</b> with its actual state...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{and global}} warming indices for ten major {{appliances}} have been examined. A two-page summary report for each <b>appliance</b> <b>category</b> has been written {{as well as a}} combined summary for major <b>appliances.</b> <b>The</b> <b>appliances</b> studied are: refrigerators, room air conditioners (RACs), freezers, gas ranges, electric ranges, microwave ovens, clothes washers, gas dryers, electric dryers, and dishwashers.

40|$|Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a {{technology}} offering methods to identify appliances in homes {{based on their}} consumption characteristics and the total household demand. Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is evaluated under different test scenarios.
