5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> site of a former breeding colony, or {{are the result of}} a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E

Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|There is a Glen Cailleach which joins to Glen Lyon in Perthshire. The glen has {{a stream}} named Alt nan Cailleach.

There is a small Shieling in the Glen, known as either Tigh nan Cailleach or Tigh nam Bodach, which houses a series of apparently carved stones.

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
5|$|The first gardens on the Cummer {{property}} {{were designed}} by Ossian Cole Simonds in 1903, just after the adjoining house was completed. Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia redesigned this garden and created what would {{become known as the}} English Garden in 1910. Ellen Biddle Shipman designed the Italian Garden in 1931. Sections of Clara and Waldo's garden {{were designed by}} William Lyman Phillips, a partner in the Olmstead Brothers firm. The Olmsted Brothers also advised Ninah on a design for a wall garden in 1922, but she chose to plant a garden designed by William Mercer of Philadelphia. The Cummer Gardens were selected for the National Register of Historic Places because <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> history of American landscape design in the first four decades of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. <b>They</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. <b>They</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman slaves {{also began to}} change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a {{constitution}} was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.|$|E
