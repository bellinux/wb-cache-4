500|$|Towards {{the end of}} recording, Gabriel became [...] "obsessed" [...] {{with the}} album's track listing and created an audio {{cassette}} of all the song's beginnings and ends in order to hear how the sounds blended together. His original intention was to have [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] {{at the end of}} the record, but because of its prominent bass line, it had to be placed earlier in the listing on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed {{at the end of the}} album. So was completed in February 1986 and cost £200,000 to make. It was over-dubbed at Power Station Studios in New York, despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer-telephone set up, reasoning, [...] "that's a lot of information to send via phone. Isn't it amazing <b>though?</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> send a song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite". It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid-February 1986 at London's Townhouse Studios.|$|E
500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear it {{in many of the}} records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively." ...|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E

2500|$|Hamlet himself {{realizes that}} [...] "he is the {{greatest}} riddle of all" [...] and at 3.2.345 he expresses his frustration with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: [...] "how unworthy a thing you make of me... call me what instrument you will, <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> fret me, you cannot play upon me".|$|E

2500|$|... "Where I Sleep" [...] is {{the third}} track from the album, and Sandé {{said she wanted to}} keep the track [...] "open" [...] and let people connect to the song in their own way, as she pointed out that the song does not {{necessarily}} have to be romantic. The singer said she didn't intend to make any of her tracks romantic, <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> apply the tracks to romance and love. She said the song means; [...] "this is it, when I am with you I could be anywhere and I feel at home".|$|E
6000|$|... "It is sweet," [...] she said. She asked curiously: [...] "What {{did you do}} last night, {{after you}} left me? I can't guess, <b>though</b> I daresay <b>you</b> <b>can</b> guess what I did." ...|$|R

[...] "I {{think we}} got the most value; and they didn't {{look as if they}} could afford it so well; <b>though</b> <b>you</b> never <b>can</b> tell, here. These ladies may be the highest kind of highhotes practising a praiseworthy economy. I hope the lesson won't be lost on us. They have saved enough by us for their coffee at the Orangery. Let us go and have a little willow-leaf tea!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film one star, commenting, [...] "There are enough laughs {{scattered}} throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie {{seems like a}} passable comedy. By {{the time you get}} home, <b>though,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> barely remember the jokes." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's running time: [...] "Though the film is hardly laugh-free, its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal too found the film's length [...] "exhausting," [...] noting, [...] "Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches [...] for ever more common denominators in toilet humor." ...|$|E

5000|$|... == Explanation == Transverse {{waves are}} waves that are {{oscillating}} perpendicularly to {{the direction of}} propagation. If you anchor {{one end of a}} ribbon or string and hold the other end in your hand, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> create transverse waves by moving your hand up and down. Notice <b>though,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also launch waves by moving your hand side-to-side. This is an important point. There are two independent directions in which wave motion can occur. In this case, these motions are the y and z directions mentioned above, while the wave propagates away in the x direction.|$|R

5000|$|In a 2010 interview, Gianotti {{said that}} she saw no contradiction between science and faith and they belong to [...] "two {{different}} spheres".

5000|$|... "It {{was quite}} {{hard for the}} band to shift from having played to loops of other people to playing to loops of themselves.

6000|$|Clare sat down, {{and after}} a few minutes Dick resumed: [...] "You passed my door to-day, and it's curious that I knew your step, <b>though,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> understand, without {{actually}} recognizing it. It was as if I was dreaming something that was real. The worst of being ill is that your brain gets working independently, bringing things up on its own account, without your telling it. Anyhow, I remembered the iron steps with the glow of the window through the curtain, and how you slipped--you wore little white shoes, and the moonlight shone through the branches on your dress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am quite}} charmed,' said the father rising, and walking slowly to and fro--stopping {{now and then}} to glance at himself in the mirror, or survey a picture through his glass, with the air of a connoisseur, 'that we have had this conversation, Ned, unpromising as it was. It {{establishes}} a confidence between us which is quite delightful, and was certainly necessary, <b>though</b> how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ever have mistaken our positions and designs, I confess I cannot understand.
