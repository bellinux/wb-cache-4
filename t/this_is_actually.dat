5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader {{as long as there}} were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of the keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

25|$|Ponda Baba {{is shown}} to be an architect. He goes with Evazan to the cantina at lunch and there asks Luke Skywalker a {{question}} (in non-human tongue). A drunken Evazan convinces Luke that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a threat, and despite Ponda's friendly intentions, Obi-Wan Kenobi slices his arm off. He returns to work, but is laid off as the chopped-off appendage was his drawing arm.|$|E
25|$|In The Picnic, (November 14, 1930) Minnie {{introduces}} {{her boyfriend}} {{to her new}} pet dog, Rover. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> Pluto making his first appearance as an individual character. Two unnamed bloodhound guard dogs strikingly similar to him had previously appeared in The Chain Gang (August 18, 1930) which featured Mickey incarcerated in prison without Minnie at his side. Otherwise the short features a typical picnic excursion harassed by forest animals and brought to a premature end by a sudden rain.|$|E

25|$|A simple step up {{from the}} dual drive concept {{is to use a}} single engine and split the power output into two transmissions. Steering is {{accomplished}} by changing the gear on one track and not the other. This reduces the complexity of the dual-drive system when combined with a modern engine. It also introduces a new behaviour; additional load on one track causes the other to slow as well. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> an improvement over the dual drive solution, as it causes the entire tank to slow, not turn towards the loaded track.|$|E
25|$|The {{heat that}} drives {{geothermal}} {{activity in the}} Yellowstone area comes from brine (salty water) that is 1.5 to 3 miles (2.4 to 4.8km) below the surface. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> below the solid volcanic rock and sediment that extends {{to a depth of}} 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m) and is inside the hot but mostly solid part of the pluton that contains Yellowstone’s magma chamber. At that depth the brine is superheated to temperatures that exceed 400°F or 205°C but is able to remain a liquid because it is under great pressure (like a huge pressure cooker).|$|E
25|$|Close by the Good Shepherd is {{the stately}} New Synagogue, {{on the eastern}} side of Clapton Common. This Grade II listed {{building}} is a little deceptive, appearing much older than it actually is. In spite of its handsome Georgian-style exterior, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> post-Edwardian, built in 1915. It is, however, a faithful replica of an earlier building, the Great St Helen's Synagogue in the City of London, which was designed by John Davies in 1838. The current building contains a number of original fixtures from its predecessor. Endangered for a while, the synagogue was restored in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|<b>This</b> album <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> {{released}} in Japan first with strange album title Two Swimmers & A Bag of Jockies. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> intended <b>is</b> {{a tribute to}} their friend and ex-drummer Mark Stewart, a cockney from East London. Two swimmers refers to fish, and jockies' whips is slang for chips - so literally: 2 fish {{and a bag of}} chips.|$|R

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artifacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an entirely}} {{different}} way to accomplish the same timing measurement, not by comparing {{the timing of the}} pulse envelopes, but timing the phase of the signals. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> quite easy to do in electronics, and can be displayed directly using a simple mechanical pointer. The trick to such a system is to ensure the master and slave stations are phase-coherent, which was an expensive and complex proposition during World War II. But by isolating the expensive portions of the system at the few broadcast stations, the Decca Navigation System using this technique went active in 1944, offering accuracy similar to Gee but using low-cost mechanical displays which were also much easier to use.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{upwelling}} {{is found}} in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.|$|E
