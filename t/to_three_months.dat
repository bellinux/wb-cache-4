5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E

5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs.

5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, Rehman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on 23 September 2003 in a 1–0 defeat away to Wigan Athletic {{in the second}} round of the Football League Cup, coming on as a substitute for Junichi Inamoto after 57 minutes. Six days later, he was sent on loan to Brighton & Hove Albion of the Second Division, initially for one month until November. He scored on his debut for the club on 30 September, concluding a 3–1 away win at Rushden & Diamonds. On 11 October, he opened a 3–0 win against Grimsby Town at the Withdean Stadium, finishing a corner by Leon Knight in Bob Booker's first match in charge. Rehman's loan was extended <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> ending in January 2004. He made eleven league appearances, scoring two goals.|$|E
5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E

5|$|Joel Stoffer and Neil Flynn have minor {{roles as}} FBI agents {{interrogating}} Indiana {{in a scene}} following the opening sequence. Alan Dale plays General Ross, who protests his innocence. Andrew Divoff and Pasha D. Lychnikoff play Soviet soldiers. Spielberg cast Russian-speaking actors as Soviet soldiers so their accents would be authentic. Dimitri Diatchenko plays Spalko's right-hand man who battles Indiana at Marshall College. Diatchenko bulked up to 250 pounds to look menacing, and his role was originally minor with ten days of filming. When shooting the fight, Ford accidentally hit his chin, and Spielberg liked Diatchenko's humorous looking reaction, so he expanded his role <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of filming. Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a cemetery guard.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials {{as varied as}} wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce {{the provisions of the}} edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E

It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television, with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately {{one year to}} produce. The process included several months of research into the historical facts, two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of writing, eight weeks of filming both on location and at London's Twickenham Studios, and {{three to four months}} of post-production.|$|E

The medallions were stored in the Command Service Module during flight and on missions involving a lunar landing, a small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module. The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing. Except where noted, all medallions struck for Apollo 7–14 were flown, and serial numbers for Apollo 14–17 medallions appear on the rim.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat which were imprisoned up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to their health and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community.|$|E

5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, while {{going through}} {{insurance}} papers in his parents' home, Rose learned of his biological father's existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, {{because he did not}} want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends suggested he call himself Axl Rose; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
