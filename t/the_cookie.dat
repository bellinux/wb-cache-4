5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into <b>the</b> <b>cookie</b> tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is <b>the</b> <b>cookie</b> cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between varied amounts of wheat bran incorporated into peanut butter <b>cookies,</b> and <b>the</b> objective and sensory qualities of <b>the</b> <b>cookies.</b> Bran was incorporated at 0 percent, 10 percent, 30 percent and 50 percent {{of the weight of}} the flour.

Neither volume nor spread were consistently affected by bran level. A panel of 11 home economists taste-tested <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> with <b>the</b> different bran levels and completed a rating card for each on various sensory qualities.

40|$|Abstract: Full fat {{flaxseed}} flour {{was supplemented with}} wheat flour @ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 %. Cookies were prepared from composite flours. Cookies prepared without {{flaxseed flour}} were kept as control. The mean quality score of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> decreased with <b>the</b> {{increase in the level}} of the flaxseed flour supplementation. Colour and crispiness of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> showed a declining trend as compared to flavour and texture of cookies. Cookies containing 20 % and lower level of the full fat flaxseed flour were acceptable in relation to their overall acceptability. Significant reduction in the spread factor of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> was observed. Addition of the flaxseed flour restricted the spread of <b>the</b> <b>cookies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Protein-enriched cookies were {{prepared}} by supplementing gram flour into wheat flour at levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % and analysed for physicochemical properties. The protein quality of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> {{was assessed by}} feeding gram flour-supplemented cookies to albino rats for 10 days. The supplementation resulted in {{a significant increase in}} protein, fat, crude fibre and ash contents of <b>the</b> <b>cookies.</b> <b>The</b> thickness and spread factor of cookies differ significantly while non-significant effect was observed in the width of <b>the</b> <b>cookies.</b> <b>The</b> protein efficiency ratio, net protein utilization, biological value and true digestibility differed significantly among diets containing cookies with gram flour fed to rats. Cookies with 30 % substitution of straight grade flour and gram flour produced acceptable cookies as compared to control. <b>The</b> <b>cookies</b> containing 40 - 50 % gram flour were best regarded as protein bioavailability for rats...|$|R

25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after <b>the</b> <b>cookie),</b> but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate <b>the</b> <b>cookie</b> or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
