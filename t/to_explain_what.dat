5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of his attempt <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin had been unable <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> had gone wrong with his expedition.|$|E

50|$|Sverdrup’s Critical Depth Hypothesis {{is limited}} <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>what</b> initiates a spring bloom. It does not predict its magnitude.

5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not {{tolerate}} failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny, with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance {{to make good on}} the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the {{structure}} was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld {{in an attempt to}} understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

25|$|Some biographers, such as Kuriyama and Downie, {{nevertheless}} {{take the}} inquest to {{be a true}} account of what occurred, but in trying <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> really happened if the account was not true, others {{have come up with a}} variety of murder theories.|$|E

50|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} male protagonist as he chases his future self, {{who has been}} captured, through time for an unknown reason. A running gag is that, just as a {{character}} is about <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what's</b> going on, they are interrupted, keeping the protagonist - and the player - in the dark. The plot contains elements of time travel, the time paradox effect, and alternate time-lines.|$|R

25|$|The {{major problem}} in visual {{perception}} is that what people see {{is not simply a}} translation of retinal stimuli (i.e., the image on the retina).

25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} was first posited <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> were then {{considered to be}} glacial deposits near the equator.

In addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.|$|E
25|$|These {{are similar}} to the {{well-known}} licences, in that they're defined before their use and can be applied to many instances of licensing.
