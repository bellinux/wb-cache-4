5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. <b>The</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg.

40|$|Abstract. We {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyperbolic twist knot cone-manifolds using Schläfli formula. Even though general {{ideas for}} calculating <b>the</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> cone-manifolds are around, {{since there is}} no concrete calculation written, we present here the concrete calculations. We express the length of the singular locus in terms of the distance between the two axes fixed by two generators. In this way the calculation becomes simpler than using the singular locus directly. <b>The</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyperbolic twist knot cone-manifolds simpler than Steve-dore’s knot are known.
