5|$|Myśli nowoczesnego Polaka (<b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> a Modern Pole), 1902.|$|E
5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the line, {{supervised}} by Grainger & Miller, proved challenging, as a large-scale contracting industry {{was not yet}} in place in Scotland; nor was large-scale financing. At the end of 1838 Miller was instructed to build a branch from Barassie to Troon Harbour, earlier <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> taking over the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and converting it—as it was then still a horse-operated plateway—having been dropped.|$|E
60|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} with her eating eyes, And I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the second with hers, green-gray, And I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the third, experienced, wise, And I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the fourth who sang all day.|$|R
60|$|He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{his poor}} child, Little Dorrit, {{for a long}} time there; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her going home; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her in the night; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her when the day came round again. And the poor child Little Dorrit <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him--too faithfully, ah, too faithfully!--in the shadow of the Marshalsea wall.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{the glossy}} ringlets and pearly teeth; I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Kalydor; I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the coachman's bruised ear and bloody nose; I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the tender love secrets {{which she had}} whispered to the judge and jury and a {{thousand}} tittering auditors,--and gave another groan! ...|$|R
5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction, and doubts about his career, triggered <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. Cooper has abstained from alcohol since 2004, remarking that it would have destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|Preoccupations are {{thoughts}} {{which are}} not fixed, false or intrusive, but have an undue prominence in the person's mind. Clinically significant preoccupations would include <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide, homicidal thoughts, suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders, depressive beliefs (for example that one is unloved or a failure), or the cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression.|$|E
5|$|She is {{the wife}} of former U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. and daughter-in-law of Jesse Jackson. Her {{candidacy}} for the city council of a major city was part of national news stories in The New York Times, and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> her running for {{a position in the}} United States House of Representatives were noted in Time.|$|E
60|$|Ireland! I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Robert Emmet, {{and that}} last speech of his before Lord Norbury; I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Tommy Moore, and his amatory verses: I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Curran, Grattan, Plunket, and O'Connell; I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> my uncle's ostler, Patrick Flinnigan; and I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the {{shipwreck}} of the gallant Albion, tost to {{pieces on the}} very shore now in sight; and I thought I should {{very much like to}} leave the ship and visit Dublin and the Giant's Causeway.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Direck did not {{hesitate}} three seconds. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Gladys; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Miss Cecily Corner.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> death {{brings about}} renunciation. For an aspirant the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{death is a}} means of advancement.|$|R
5|$|Steins;Gates {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either the dialogue between the various characters or the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> the protagonist. Like many other visual novels, there are specific points in Steins;Gate where the user is given a choice to affect the direction of the game.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide.|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} {{to show you}} what sort of a man the Nabob was, who was thus set up in {{defiance}} of the Company's authority; what Mr. Hastings himself <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him; what the judges <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him; and what all the world <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that," [...] Miss Gleason assented candidly. [...] "Yes, I have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that. I have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{their being}} {{constantly}} thrown together, in this way. It would not discourage me. She {{could be quite}} as true to her vocation as if she remained single. Truer." ...|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Aquinas {{came to be}} {{assessed}} positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen {{in contrast to the}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Kant (itself seen as representative <b>of</b> ‘modern’ <b>thought).</b> Other ‘modern’ forms <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> including Ontologism, Traditionalism, the dualism of Anton Günther, and the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Descartes, were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.|$|R
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's illness {{left him}} with a {{permanent}} stutter and he gave up any <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> entering the ministry at that time. In preparation for joining a relative in trade in Lisbon, he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to Aramaic, and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, natural philosophy, logic, and metaphysics through the works of Isaac Watts, Willem 's Gravesande, and John Locke.|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. I wished I 'adn't jumped--an' I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> my baby-- that died--and--[in {{a rather}} {{surprised}} voice] and I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> d-dancin'.|$|R
6000|$|... "But--but--but Elspeth and me never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{my being}} {{so far away}} that she couldna see me. We <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a farmer near Thrums." ...|$|R
60|$|MORELL. Candida: you are {{shocking}} me. I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> my attractions. I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> your goodness--your purity. That is what I confide in.|$|R
5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Longue-Pointe was {{an attempt}} by Ethan Allen and a small force of American and Quebec militia to capture Montreal from British forces on September 25, 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War. Allen, who had been {{instructed}} only to raise militia forces among the local inhabitants, had long had <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> taking the lightly defended city. When he reached the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River with about 110 men, he {{seized the opportunity to}} try. Major John Brown, who Allen claimed was supposed to provide additional forces, did not appear as they had planned, isolating Allen and his men {{on the north side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each Ef: The First Tale and Ef: The Latter Tale. Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each scenario in the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. These scenes are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.|$|E
60|$|Holley <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his gun; Bostil <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{the splendid}} horse. The <b>thoughts</b> were {{characteristic}} <b>of</b> these riders. The other men, however, {{recovering from a}} horror-broken silence, burst out in acclaim of Slone's feat.|$|R
50|$|In some {{religions}} and traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as guises of the devil. Even when <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as individual demons, some are often <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the devil; List of demons {{has a more}} general listing.|$|R
60|$|Resolved {{not to be}} beaten, {{the unfortunate}} Irishman sat down again, and again started up, but, feeling ashamed, {{suddenly}} flung himself flat on his back, held his breath, and ground his teeth together. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> gridirons; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the rack; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> purgatory; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the propriety of starting up and of tearing limb from limb the attendant, who, with a quiet smile, lay down beside him and shut his eyes; he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the impossibility of bearing it an instant longer; and then he suddenly thought that it felt a little easier. From this point he began to experience sensations that were slightly pleasurable, and a profuse perspiration broke out over his whole body.|$|R
5|$|There are {{numerous}} theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning {{the identity of}} the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{continued}} {{his work in}} literature along with that in the law, and in 1814–1815 the Philadelphia Port Folio published a series of his essays entitled <b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> a Hermit. Financial success was for once his {{as a result of}} these endeavors; he also realized profits from land sales near the Dan River, and the sale of Woodbridge when the family moved again, to Lynchburg, Virginia in 1818.|$|E
5|$|Wild had <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> a second, more {{productive}} {{season in the}} ice, and took the ship to Cape Town for a refit. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death.|$|E
6000|$|FENWICK. What do I care? I {{loved you}} too. Little he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that, little either <b>of</b> you <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that. His blood--I'll have his blood! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I'm glad you've <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "But I've <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it too. I've left her a legacy--five {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{showing it}} to you--I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> showing it to every one. I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> paying my {{debt to the}} Bellegardes that way. So I told them, and I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you tell me, {{to keep out of}} the explosion. But I have given it up." ...|$|R
