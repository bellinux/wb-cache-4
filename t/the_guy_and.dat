25|$|Σ'αγαπω Μ'αγαπας (S'agapo M'agapas (I love you, You love me)) began {{broadcasting}} in Greece in 2000. Its {{format is}} weekly, 26-minute episodes, {{much like the}} original. Thodoris Atheridis plays Thodoris, <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> Dimitra Papadopoulou plays Dimitra, the girl, replicating the original version's concept of using the actors' first names for the characters.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Lovato singing [...] "I feel a {{separation}} coming on, Cos [...] I know, {{you want to}} be moving on." [...] Lyrically, the song sees the protagonist reminisce about a winter romance, with lines such as, [...] "I remember us together / We promised that forever." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Maragret Wappler deemed it an [...] "ode to breakups" [...] and noted that the protagonist asks her willful boyfriend to remember [...] "the good times" [...] of their relationship. In the chorus, she sings [...] "Don't surrender, surrender, surrender", before asking him to remember their [...] "promise of forever". Lovato explained that the song is about [...] "a girl [...] has so much to say to <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> it feels like he's not listening, and she wants him to remember everything that they had".|$|E
500|$|Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, {{a veteran}} who guides and trains Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt {{said of her}} role, [...] "In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding the hand of <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> he's running through explosions leading her, and I wanted {{to be doing the}} leading." [...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E

2500|$|Berkowitz's later {{claims are}} {{dismissed}} by many. Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that [...] "when {{they talked to}} David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything step by step by step. The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it. He's <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> there's nothing else to look at." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{was offered}} the {{starring}} role in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket {{in a conversation with}} Stanley Kubrick, but after an eight-month negotiation, a financial agreement could not be reached. [...] "It was a difficult decision, because in that eight-month period, I read everything I could about <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> I was really fascinated by him," [...] Hall said when asked about the film. [...] "I {{wanted to be a part}} of that film, but it didn't work out. But all sorts of stories circulated, like I got on set and I was fired, or I was pissed at him for shooting too long. It's all not true." [...] He was replaced with Matthew Modine. His next film would be 1988's Johnny Be Good, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Robert Downey, Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some critics panned Hall's performance as a high school football star, claiming that he, the movies' reigning geek, was miscast for the role. A review for The Washington Post claimed that the film was [...] "crass, vulgar, and relentlessly brain-dead." ...|$|E

[...] "Stand there, you--right there, {{where they can}} {{recognise}} you, with your hand on <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> wave your hat to them. Quick, or your brains will be over your coat. Put an inch of your knife into him, Ned. Now, will you wave your hat? Try him again, then. Hey, shoot him! stop him!" ...|$|E
60|$|The winch-driver was {{watching}} the others who struggled with <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps forgot {{it was not a}} strong man who had come to his help. For a moment or two, Adam kept his grip, and then his hands opened and he staggered back. Somebody shouted, a pulley rattled, and the case, running down, crashed against the steamer's rail. Kit ran forward, but reached the spot a moment too late, for Adam lay unconscious on the iron deck.|$|E

Darling, have you in your more {{material}} moments ever toyed with a Boyd's Premier Breakfast-Sausage or kept body and soul together with a slice off a Boyd's Excelsior Home-Cured Ham? My father makes them, and the tragedy of my life is that {{he wants me to}} help him at it. This was my position. I loathed the family business as much as dad loved it. I had a notion--a fool notion, as it has turned out--that I could make good in the literary line. I've scribbled in a sort of way ever since I was in college. When the time came for me to join the firm, I put it to dad straight. I said, [...] "Give me a chance, one good, square chance, to see if the divine fire is really there, or if somebody has just turned on the alarm as a practical joke." [...] And we made a bargain. I had written this play, and we made it a test-case. We fixed it up that dad should put up the money to give it a Broadway production. If it succeeded, all right; I'm the young Gus Thomas, and may go ahead in the literary game. If it's a fizzle, off goes my coat, and I abandon pipe-dreams of literary triumphs and start in as the guy who put the Co. in Boyd & Co. Well, events have proved that I am <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> now I'm going to keep my part of the bargain just as squarely as dad kept his. I know quite well that if I refused to play fair and chose to stick on here in New York and try again, dad would go on staking me. That's the sort of man he is. But I wouldn't do it for a million Broadway successes. I've had my chance, and I've foozled; and now I'm going back to make him happy by being a real live member of the firm. And the queer thing about it is that last night I hated the idea, and this morning, now that I've got you, I almost look forward to it.' ...|$|E

60|$|That {{fight was}} an awful sight. General Cheatham made his men strip their coats off and throw them in a pile, and said, 'Now follow me to hell or victory!' I heard him say that from the pilot-house; and then he galloped in, {{at the head of}} his troops. Old General Pillow, with his white hair, mounted on a white horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops as lively as a boy. By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and here they came! tearing along, {{everybody}} for himself and Devil take the hindmost! and down under the bank they scrambled, and took shelter. I was sitting with my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window. All at once I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet. I didn't stop to think about anything, I just tilted over backwards and landed on the floor, and staid there. The balls came booming around. Three cannon-balls went through the chimney; one ball took off the corner of the pilot-house; shells were screaming and bursting all around. Mighty warm times--I wished I hadn't come. I lay there on the pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster and faster. I crept in behind the big stove, {{in the middle of the}} pilot-house. Presently a minie-ball came through the stove, and just grazed my head, and cut my hat. I judged it was time to go away from there. The captain was on the roof with a red-headed major from Memphis--a fine-looking man. I heard him say he wanted to leave here, but 'that pilot is killed.' I crept over to the starboard side to pull the bell to set her back; raised up and took a look, and I saw about fifteen shot holes through the window panes; had come so lively I hadn't noticed them. I glanced out on the water, and the spattering shot were like a hailstorm. I thought best to get out of that place. I went down the pilot-house guy, head first--not feet first but head first--slid down--before I struck the deck, the captain said we must leave there. So I climbed up <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> got on the floor again. About that time, they collared my partner and were bringing him up to the pilot-house between two soldiers. Somebody had said I was killed. He put his head in and saw me on the floor reaching for the backing bells. He said, 'Oh, hell, he ain't shot,' and jerked away from the men who had him by the collar, and ran below. We were there until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then got away all right.|$|E
