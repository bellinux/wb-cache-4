25|$|Skins Rise follows Cook (now {{somewhere in}} his early 20s) {{who is on the}} run and living alone in Manchester. In an {{introductory}} voiceover, Cook explains his thoughts and alludes towards a murder he may have committed; it is implied but not outright stated that he is avoiding capture after killing John Foster a few years back. He is now a drug dealer and has a semi-serious relationship with a woman named Emma (Esther Smith), but becomes mesmerised by Charlie (Hannah Britland), the girlfriend of local drug lord Louis (Liam Boyle) after he is asked to watch over her for a few days. After Louis brutally kills a man named Jason (Lucien Laviscount) for having an affair with Charlie, Cook flees Manchester, taking Emma with him. En route, Charlie calls Cook and begs him to take her with them. The three end up at Emma's family's old country home, in a remote part of the country. Not long after though, Louis arrives, explaining that he tracked their car. After Charlie refuses to go with him, the three leave the house and find Emma's parents' car abandoned, indicating they have been killed. The trio are stranded in the woods, where Louis catches up with and murders Emma. Seeing this, Cook decides he is done running, confronting Louis and beating him to a pulp. He declares, I'm Cook. You <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> kill me? I'm fucking Cook. He helps Charlie escape and alerting the police, while a voiceover indicates he is pondering the significance of life and death.|$|E
500|$|For Prost, {{his debut}} victory was memorable mostly {{for the change}} it made in his mindset. [...] "Before, you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do it," [...] he said. [...] "Now you know you can." [...] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole {{position}} in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E

500|$|Get Weird, {{their third}} album, was {{released}} on 6 November 2015. With {{the exception of the}} [...] "moody" [...] trap track [...] "Lightning", it saw the group return to a pop music style, though it was noted for its sexualised tone. The song [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex" [...] and alludes to the sexual act of cunnilingus and fellatio in its lyrics. It also samples the line [...] "hot love and emotion" [...] from [...] "Hold On, We're Going Home" [...] performed by Drake; he, along with the song's other composers Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib, Majid Al Maskati, Jordan Ullman and Anthony Jeffries, received songwriting credits as a result. [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] is a retro-Motown track reminiscent of Shadow Morton's work. NME writer Nick Levine noted that the lyrics [...] "He was just a dick and I knew it" [...] on [...] "Hair" [...] and [...] "Your voice dropped and you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> handle me" [...] on [...] "Grown" [...] were two examples of many [...] "sassy" [...] tracks on Get Weird.|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|The song names God in {{its title}} and lyrics, {{unusual for a}} pop single of its time, as Asher recalled: [...] "Unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one [...] <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say 'God' in a song." [...] The sentiments {{expressed}} in its lyric were not specific to any God, and could be addressed to any higher force, being a song about moving forward after loss. Wilson explained that his and Asher's intention was to create the feeling of [...] "being blind but in being blind, you can see more".|$|E
6000|$|Jake smiled. [...] "Perhaps not. I reckon <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hit up the pace. My notion is, you've put it most {{as high as}} {{the boys}} will stand for." ...|$|R
6000|$|My compunction was real; I laid {{my hand on}} his shoulder. [...] "I beg you {{to forgive}} me--I've made a mistake. You don't know what I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> knew. <b>You</b> <b>could,</b> if I had been right, have {{rendered}} me a service; and I had my reasons for assuming {{that you would be}} in a position to meet me." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{in their}} same article, Inkling Magazine stated that [...] "sing Erica Kane's {{currently}} known offspring as an example, {{it seems that}} the science behind the drama of soap storylines isn’t entirely incorrect" [...] and that [...] "maybe that's not as surprising as it seems. A lot of weird and crazy things pop up in scientific and medical research." [...] Who, for example, would have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> grow a human ear {{on the back of a}} mouse? Who would have believed that one day we could make fluorescent green pigs? Keeping in mind those miracles of nature might help suspend the disbelief the next time a pint-sized, ringlet-haired child soap star 'grows' into a sultry brooding teenager after a summer 'away.' Hey, it could happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) {{mourning}} the recent {{death of his}} mentor General Arcadius (Roger Allam). Kröd is accompanied by his girlfriend Aneka (India de Beaufort), his pig-like 'Grobble' servant Loquasto (Steve Speirs), his sorcerer friend Zezelryck (Kevin Hart) and Bruce (Marques Ray), Arcadius' flamboyant ex-lover. Later, Kröd tells Aneka he wants to seek couples counseling due to her tendency to use sex as a weapon against her enemies. But Aneka refuses, and says she plans to leave {{them to participate in}} 'The Raccoon Festival': a pagan religious ritual in which she has sex with 300 men. When he reacts with anger, Aneka says she is leaving Kröd and tells him, [...] "And I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have been one of the}} ones." [...] Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) is told by his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) that they are still working to discover how to use the Eye of Gulga Grymna, the recently unearthed ancient weapon that Dongalor wants to use to gain power.|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{want to get}} a room. We {{have been}} lodging {{together}} in London, and don't know anyone down here. I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell us of some quiet, respectable people who have a room to let?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] the man said, [...] "but the <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> speak Punjabi did {{not enter}} my mind.

6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell me that, Macumazahn, who, he says, {{are such}} {{an old friend}} of his; also why he chooses to sojourn in a dark hole among the dead instead of in the {{sunshine}} among the living, here at Ulundi." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{truth is}} that we never <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have been caught," [...] he said; [...] "we counted on you as the one red-hot revolutionary left in the world.
