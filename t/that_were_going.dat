5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for {{the cast and crew}} during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
25|$|The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece {{tried to}} adopt deflationary {{policies}} {{to stave off}} the crises <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.|$|E

[...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, very scary. We ended up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{breakout}} of World War II in Europe in 1939, missionary {{efforts in}} Tonga continued. At the time, mission president Dunn encouraged {{the people to}} maintain gardens and extra food supplies. Within a year of the war starting, LDS Church president Heber J. Grant sent a telegram to Dunn directing that all foreign missionaries return to the United States. Dunn arranged for those missionaries to go to Hawaii. In an effort {{to explain why the}} missionaries needed to return to America, Dunn stated that Grant was [...] "inspired to call them back". However, this explanation did not quell the rumors of the church being discontinued <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> around the islands. By 1942, missionaries returned to Tonga. Dunn ensured there were at least 15 missionaries in the mission field from 1942 to 1945.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, bassist Guy Berryman revealed that the song {{was one of the}} older songs that the band had been working on and that they had to move it to one side from the list of songs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to appear in the album. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, urged them to include the track in the album, which led to the band to drag it back to the shortlist. The first verse of the song was taken from an unreleased song named [...] "December", written by frontman Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland in 1997. An early instrumental of the song from the Viva la Vida sessions was leaked into the internet in 2009, it contained an excerp from a previously performed song named [...] "Solid Ground (Until the Water Floats Over)" [...] as the intro, but it was scratched and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film.

The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film".

In January 1939, No. 460 was {{returned}} to the Pennsylvania, but was still occasionally used on Long Island as a [...] "short term 'loaner'". Starting in 1942, it hauled trains between Camden and Bay Head, New Jersey. [...] In 1951, parts were taken of other E6s locomotives <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be scrapped: the drivers on the engineer's (right) side are from PRR 1565, the air reservoir on the fireman's (left) side was from PRR 690 and the reservoir on the engineer's side was from PRR 782. 460's tender was replaced in 1952 with one from 1565; the original tender had been transferred to maintenance-of-way service. 460 was leased to the PennsylvaniaReading Seashore Lines in 1953 before being retired in 1955 and added to the Pennsylvania's collection of historic locomotives in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|After {{these had}} been reviewed, {{two of the}} {{original}} twenty-four were finalized as possibilities, A-140-F3 and A-140-F4. Differing primarily in their range ( [...] versus [...] at [...] ), they {{were used in the}} formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937, which was put forth by Rear-Admiral Fukuda Keiji; an endurance of 7,200nm was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of just turbines. The diesels were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the submarine tender Taigei. Their engines, which were similar to the ones <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be mounted in the new battleships, required a [...] "major repair and maintenance effort" [...] to keep them running due to a [...] "fundamental design defect".

500|$|Yankovic had {{previously}} heard [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" [...] during 1994 {{and felt that}} it was [...] "one of two or three songs" [...] that could be potentially parodied. He noted that it [...] "would be really good to do for the next album", but felt that [...] "when the time is right, [...] think of something" [...] to write the parody about; he then returned his attention to writing original songs. After Scotti Brothers insisted on the writing of a new lead single, Yankovic very nearly had his label cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure. However, he soon returned to the idea of parodying [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm". He decided to pair the song's music up with [...] "all the weird news stories <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on" [...] and make each verse its own vignette. Yankovic also felt that by doing this and releasing it on the box set, {{he would be able to}} capitalize on the topicality of the issues.|$|E
500|$|For many years, {{very little}} content {{from the game}} was ever {{released}} beyond screenshots that had been released to the media in promotion of the game prior to its cancellation.
