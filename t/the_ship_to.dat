5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move from one side of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> the other as the ship rolls. This can cause <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|König Wilhelm {{was also}} badly damaged in the collision, with severe {{flooding}} forward. König Wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> {{prevent it from}} sinking, but determined that the ship's pumps could hold the flooding to an acceptable level. The ship made for Portsmouth, where temporary repairs could be effected to allow <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> return to Germany. In {{the aftermath of the}} collision, the German navy held a court martial for Rear Admiral Batsch, the squadron commander, and Captains Monts and Kuehne, the commanders of the two ships, along with Lieutenant Clausa, the first officer aboard Grosser Kurfürst, to investigate the sinking.|$|E

50|$|In 2006 Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) jointly {{created a}} high tensile {{strength}} steel. The first application this steel was used for was the hulls of container ships. This steel allows <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> be just as strong without the thick steel that it was requiring for them to grow in size. The smaller thickness allows <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> attain a greater fuel-efficiency cutting down on the environmental load of <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 14 December 2009 the US Navy officially {{transferred}} Wisconsin to {{the city}} of Norfolk, ending the requirement for <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> be preserved for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship. A formal ceremony transferring <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> the city of Norfolk took place on 16 April 2010. Wisconsin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 March 2012.|$|E
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Prinz Eugen {{was handed}} over to France. The French removed the main {{armament}} for inspection and used <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> test aerial bombardment attacks, before she was finally used as a target ship by the battleships , , and , and sunk in the Atlantic in June 1922.|$|E
50|$|After {{waiting for}} the bulk of the British fleet to leave on exercises, he gave the order <b>to</b> scuttle <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> prevent their falling into British hands. The Royal Navy made desperate efforts <b>to</b> board <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> sinkings, but the German crews had spent the idle months {{preparing}} for the order, welding bulkhead doors open, laying charges in vulnerable parts of <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> and quietly dropping important keys and tools overboard so valves could not be shut.|$|R

5|$|Bridgeport {{was struck}} from the Navy List on 2 October 1941, {{and she was}} {{acquired}} by the Bridgeport Steamship Co. on 2 February 1942 for conversion to merchant service. She proved unsuitable for service as a cargo carrier, and was returned to the government a few months later, when the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took her over on 29 June 1942. The WSA transferred <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> the War Department in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes {{to destroy the}} craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E
5|$|Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts and Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd {{designed}} <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>To</b> minimise risk they {{copied the}} hull {{design of the}} large wooden frigate , modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box, or citadel, amidships along the single gun deck, which protected most of the ship's guns. Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as broadside ironclads.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 October 1978, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> put <b>to</b> sea {{to conduct}} a one-day {{exercise}} with a task group of deploying U.S. <b>ships</b> headed by <b>the</b> aircraft carrier [...] Air Wing Seventeen's planes conducted mock attacks on the task group <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> practice anti-air warfare.

5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{instructions}} in relatively small print for various technological devices appear at several {{points in the}} film, the most visible of which are the lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity toilet on the Aries Moon shuttle. Similar detailed instructions for replacing the explosive bolts also appear on the hatches of the E.V.A. pods, most visibly in closeup just before Bowman's pod leaves <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> rescue Frank Poole.|$|E
5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs aboard <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> {{take home}} to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs {{opened with a}} lancet and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their remains is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Armistice between Germany and the Allies that ended World War I, the {{majority}} of the German fleet was to be interned at Scapa Flow; this included Hindenburg {{and the rest of the}} battlecruisers. On 21 November 1918, <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> be interned—14 capital ships, seven light cruisers, and 50 of the most modern torpedo boats—departed German waters for what would prove to be the last time. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, who was given command of <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> be interned, that he could not allow the Allies <b>to</b> seize <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.|$|R

5|$|During the voyage, {{the ship}} {{encounters}} a supernova. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves {{into a black}} hole, where Arrow falls. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E
5|$|Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior {{officer to}} {{have died in the}} sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E

50|$|The {{limitations}} of the SS-N-1 missile were clear by 1965 and the Soviet Navy decided <b>to</b> convert <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> a more general purpose / ASW role. These <b>ships</b> were called <b>the</b> Kanin class by NATO. This involved providing the destroyers with a new bow sonar, MG-332 Titan-2 that controlled two quintuple torpedo tubes and three RBU-6000s. To clear the bow sonar also required that the bow be extended 5.3 ft. A helicopter pad was installed aft that allowed <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> operate a Kamov Ka-25 helicopter.|$|R
5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, {{passengers}} on Batavier II witnessed {{an attack by}} two German airplanes against a British steamship between the Galloper and the North Hinder Lightships.
