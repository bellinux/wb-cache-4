5|$|Eventually Henderson leased two {{properties}} in Essex Street for £250 per year, {{at the site}} of <b>the</b> <b>modern-day</b> Esplanade Hotel.

Henderson ultimately settled on the current site on a hill overlooking Fremantle.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{failures}} and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, {{and became the first}} Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of <b>the</b> <b>modern-day</b> city of Split in Croatia.|$|E
