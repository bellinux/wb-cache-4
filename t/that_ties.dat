5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> the various narratives together.|$|E

5|$|In {{the credits}} of HD 1.5 Remix, clips of Kingdom Hearts Re:coded were shown, hinting at its {{inclusion}} in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced that Re:coded {{would be part}} of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. Due to the games touch screen use on the Nintendo DS, console conversion was ruled out as it would necessitate a full remake. Two additional hours of cinematics were created for the game to cover the entire story and show the games connections to other Kingdom Hearts titles. The collection features the game as HD cinematics, much like 358/2 Days was in the HD 1.5 Remix collection. The collection also includes both Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix in HD and trophy support. Additional events occur in the cinematic scenes not seen in the original, with new voice acting, orchestrated audio, and including new battle scenes and a scene <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> Re:coded and Dream Drop Distance together. The collection was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Louisville {{jumped out}} to a 28–7 lead in the third quarter, behind two {{touchdown}} passes by Heisman-candidate Teddy Bridgewater. Late in the third quarter, however, UCF staged a rally <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> the greatest comeback in school history (21). Storm Johnson scored a 1-yard touchdown run to trim the deficit to 28–14.

One play later, quarterback Blake Bortles completed a short pass to Storm Johnson, who then scrambled across the field for a 30-yard touchdown pass. The score tightened to 28–21. On the next drive, the Knights were able to pin Louisville at their own 15, and eventually forced a punt. On their next possession, UCF went 56 yards in only three plays, scoring yet another touchdown as time was winding down in the third quarter. The Knights scored 21 points in 4:20.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{almost universal}} critical praise. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times called {{it one of}} his favorite Fringe episodes due to the [...] "incredible" [...] opening, Brady and Noble's [...] "outstanding" [...] performances, and the scene with Olivia unknowingly talking to Walternate. Like Hanson, Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly also praised the actors' performances, and thought it was [...] "one of the most moving and revelatory episodes in the series' short history". Though he felt the episode did not quite match up to [...] "Peter", Ramsey Isler from IGN rated [...] "Subject 13" [...] an 8.5/10. He believed the opening to be [...] "tense and surprising" [...] and praised the child actors' performances. Finally, he thought the scene in which Olivia accidentally encounters Walternate was a [...] "brilliant plot twist <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> a lot of things together".|$|E

The reborn goddess of the title has multiple meanings: it refers to a female character in each game that {{could be interpreted as}} the goddess, and is also representative of the drastic changes a location undergoes during a game. The concept of reincarnation was also included in narratives and gameplay mechanics to tie in with these themes. The series' overarching title has been truncated to [...] "MegaTen" [...] by series fans. Originating in Japan, the abbreviation has become a common term for the series among its fans.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2015, Andrew Shaw of Nerdist {{felt that}} Post [...] "chose to ignore expectation, market restrictions, and {{contemporary}} trends", and that [...] "the singer pushed her vocal performances into new places, where no other vocalists could dare to sing". He compared the album's impact on audiences {{to that of}} Jimi Hendrix's 1967 album, Are You Experienced, writing it [...] "set the benchmark for what was possible when you take tradition {{and set it on}} fire". Shaw also argued further that the album was a classic and, as a whole, [...] "simply genius"; considering [...] "the masterstroke of the collection is in the thread <b>that</b> <b>ties</b> each disparate view into one singular perspective". David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors is an admirer of the record, stating he was influenced by Björk's deconstruction of classic melodies. American singer-songwriter Amy Lee has said Post is [...] "one of the biggest records in [...] life".|$|E
